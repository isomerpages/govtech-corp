	<br> From his three-month stint with our Sensors &amp; IoT team, Paul leveraged dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) systems, and developed a proof-of-concept to improve the location accuracy of global positioning system (GPS) technology. The enhanced accuracy of GPS could be used to improve road safety. </div> </div>

	<br> Hunter spent three months with our Application Infrastructure team. He worked on an Object Storage Service project where he designed and developed a Minimum Viable Product for enabling Internet objects to be made available to Intranet with access control. During his Fellowship stint, Hunter also conducted learning sessions for GovTech developers on topics such as DevOps, Kubernetes, and Blockchain.</div> </div>

	<br> Sau Sheong guided the Government Digital Services team working on the Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA) project to identify potential performance bottlenecks, possible ways to optimise the application, and design/architecture for the storage &amp; handling of data. (WOGGA) is an application that helps provide a common set of metrics and measurements to enable public sector agencies to monitor the performance of websites and digital services in real-time.  This will in turn help improve public service delivery, set more effective web and mobile strategies and provide insights for policy making.</div> </div>

	<br> Siew Hong spent six months with our Sensors and IoT team to develop a standard communication framework to allow integration with healthcare robots, a first of its kind to accelerate robotics development for healthcare sector.&nbsp; This includes standardisation of robotics sensors and intelligent packages which encourages code reusability. The middleware will also standardise communication and integration between smart systems which translate to a standardised healthcare smart systems specification for all future systems acquisition.</div> </div>

	<br> U-Zyn spent six months working with GovTech’s emerging tech team to create ‘Smart Node’, an open ecosystem of service procurements backed by blockchain for smart homes and offices. Through the shared wallet, smart appliances are able to procure services on-demand and automatically whenever supply runs low. During his stint, U-Zyn collaborated with online concierge and delivery service, Honestbee, on this experiment. As an open source software advocate, U-Zyn is delighted that GovTech is advocating the open source movement, which makes his work available to the wider tech community..</div> </div>

	<br> Arun spent three months in Singapore, and worked with GovTech’s data scientists on enhancements to Singapore’s open data portal, Data.gov.sg. Arun worked on building an exploration tool that allowed users to mash data from different datasets to create new insights. Arun also worked on Beeline https://www.beeline.sg, an open smart mobility platform developed by GovTech to empower commuters to crowd-start and activate more direct, private express bus routes to suit their travel needs. Arun helped the Beeline team to build data pipelines to track the success of their acquisition strategy and ways to retain and engage commuters.</div> </div>

	<br> Gregor’s contributions ranged from helping shape the IT strategy to coding all the way down in the IT ‘engine room’. During his nine-month stint, he established architectural practice and discipline to help channel the development teams’ energy and detect potential overlaps or gaps in GovTech’s products. Shaping a cohesive Engineering Productivity team helped operationalise GovTech’s cloud ambitions and the ‘Tech Stack’ platform strategy. Being able to articulate strategy and implementation across organisational layers created greater transparency and effective prioritization. To stay grounded, he also paired up with engineers; one example was to debug web worker concurrency issues to speed up the end-to-end encryption and decryption of data.</div> </div>
