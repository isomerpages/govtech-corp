Singapore is embarking on a journey to build a Smart Nation, with the aim of harnessing technology and data to improve the lives of citizens. If you are an established data scientist, engineer, software developer, technologist, designer or applied researcher, we need your expertise and experience!

Invited Smart Nation Fellows will collaborate with us over three to six months to co-create digital or engineering solutions that will make an impact on peopleâ€™s lives. Work on projects that we have pre-identified, or propose new, innovative projects across tech domains from artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud, data science, app development, cybersecurity to sensors & IoT.
