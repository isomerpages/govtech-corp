<p><em>Team leaders — Justin, Janice, Kelvin, Khim Soo (From left to right)</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>For numerous organisations, cultivating an engaging and high-performing
culture is often regarded as the ultimate achievement. Many aspire to reach
a harmonious state where their employees are not merely content but truly
passionate about their work. While this remains an aspiration for others,
it is a tangible reality for GovTech.</p>

<summary><strong>The power of purpose</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>At GovTech, one of our core missions is to make a positive impact through
technology. This belief that technology can improve lives is a major motivation
for GovTechies.</p>
<p>Justin How, a Deputy Director, emphasises the importance of purpose. He
highlights that unlike private companies focused on profit, GovTech's goal
is maximising the public good.</p>
<p>But what exactly is public good? It can differ depending on the partner
agency. For example, it might mean reducing fraud, improving efficiency,
or shortening wait times for critical services. Justin explains, “When
we go beyond broad platitudes and are clear on who is benefiting and how
work becomes much more rewarding”.</p>

<summary><strong>Collaboration as a catalyst</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In the pursuit of creating products and services that make life better
for Singaporeans, collaborative work naturally becomes the lifeblood of
an organisation.</p>
<p>Collaboration goes beyond our internal teams and extends to other government
agencies, private companies, and even the public. Leaders play a crucial
role in breaking down barriers and promoting a collaborative culture.</p>
<p>Janice Chua, a Deputy Director, emphasises this teamwork spirit, "When
working on a project, we don’t just rely on ourselves. We work with a larger
community, where we will try to multiply our strengths and build rapport
with one another”. By focusing on collaboration, GovTech fosters a lively
work environment where diverse ideas are welcomed and valued.</p>

<p>Another key aspect is the importance of effective resource allocation
and management. Kelvin Wong, an Assistant Director, understands the time-sensitive
nature of his team's work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address resource strain, he collaborates with project managers to strategise
project schedules that ensure both cybersecurity and governance are upheld.
Kelvin observes, "Over time, familiarity with our work processes makes
resource allocation for subsequent projects smoother."</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>GovTech leaders champion innovation. They foster a culture where learning
and adaptation go hand-in-hand. Teams are encouraged to propose fresh ideas,
take calculated risks, and learn from any bumps in the road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, GovTech is a safe space for creativity. There are no
bad ideas or silly questions. Everyone is encouraged to share their honest
thoughts and opinions without fear of repercussions.</p>
<p>Khim Soo says, “Every creative movement, whether big or small, contributes
to transforming our businesses. We must be open and willing to listen to
suggestions and work out any problems together. Ultimately, it’s about
providing the team with the hands-on experience to ideate, innovate and
freely share their ideas”.</p>

<h4>Leadership with a human touch</h4>
<p>At GovTech, the notion of good leadership extends far beyond the traditional
confines of hierarchical structures. As such, qualities such as empathy,
accessibility and inclusivity are emphasised, and genuine connections are
formed as a result.</p>
