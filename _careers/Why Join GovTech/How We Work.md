### **How We Work**

**Agent of change**  
We challenge ourselves to innovate and change things that are not meeting our goals. Speak up, not follow instructions. We seek to deconstruct problems on the fly and talk to users to solve problems. Help us get through tough spots so that we develop the best solutions that will impact our users.

**Learning & Growth**  
Opportunities for learning and growth are enormous. You are surrounded by a multidisciplinary group of experts across application development, business, design, data analytics, hardware engineering, where you can share and learn from each other. Take charge of your growth, and allocate time to attend courses, meetups, and conferences. Not enough? Embark on a technical mentorship to get guidance from technical experts locally and internationally.

**Staying Connected with the Tech Industry**

Keen for a learning stint in the private sector, you can take a six-month learning stint with tech companies under our Digital Technology Attachment Programme. You can also hop on our Digital Technical Mentorship Programme and be matched with local or overseas technical mentors. These programmes are critical in building our technical capabilities to deliver our mandate of driving public digital transformation.

**Inspiring Environment**  
We celebrate success together. We respect one another. We seek to build a positive work environment. Help us rid of toxic work factors if you spot any. We have also created a Smart Kampung where we can work, play and innovate as one GovTech. Decorate your workspace if you like. Have your meetings in co-working space. Chill out in the jamming and karaoke rooms.

**Flexible work arrangements and benefits**  
We provide generous leave benefits to meet your needs for a balanced work and family life. Work from home or exercise if you need to. Productivity is higher than forcing you to sit at your desks and crank out work. We trust that you will get the job done wherever you are, and whatever works best for you.
