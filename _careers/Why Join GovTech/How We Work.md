### How We Work

<font color="red">  Summary of how benefits for the below items, with focus on work culture, mentorship, growth and flexibility.</font> Here's how we function:

##### Innovators of change

We challenge ourselves to innovate and change things that are not meeting our goals. Speak up, not follow instructions. We seek to deconstruct problems on the fly and talk to users to solve problems. Help us get through tough spots so that we develop the best solutions that will impact our users.

 ##### <font color="red"> Growth &amp; Mentorship Opportunities </font>
Opportunities for learning and growth are enormous. You are surrounded by a multidisciplinary group of experts across application development, business, design, data analytics, hardware engineering, where you can share and learn from each other. Take charge of your growth, and allocate time to attend courses, meetups, and conferences. Not enough? Embark on a technical mentorship to get guidance from technical experts locally and internationally.

##### Tech Industry Programmes

Keen for a learning stint in the private sector, you can take a six-month learning stint with tech companies under our Digital Technology Attachment Programme. You can also hop on our Digital Technical Mentorship Programme and be matched with local or overseas technical mentors. These programmes are critical in building our technical capabilities to deliver our mandate of driving public digital transformation. 

##### Inspiring Environment

We celebrate success together. We respect one another. We seek to build a positive work environment. Help us rid of toxic work factors if you spot any. We have also created a Smart Kampung where we can work, play and innovate as one GovTech. Decorate your workspace if you like. Have your meetings in co-working space. Chill out in the jamming and karaoke rooms.

##### Flexible work arrangements and benefits
We provide generous leave benefits to meet your needs for a balanced work and family life. Work from home or exercise if you need to. Productivity is higher than forcing you to sit at your desks and crank out work. We trust that you will get the job done wherever you are, and whatever works best for you.

### Our Culture and Values

Innovation is a way of life at GovTech.  We think big, start small, and learn from failing fast.  We have programmes to empower our GovTechies spark collaboration and drive innovative projects for public good.
Our Agile, Bold, and Collaborative values unite us from different teams in delivering the business outcomes in a growth-oriented workplace.  They drive what we build for our citizens, businesses, and public officers.

We are also committed to build an inclusive and diverse work environment – regardless of gender, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.  This is what makes us do great work.

If you’re passionate about using technology to better lives of Singaporeans, we want you. Together, we can realise our vision, and become a nation of possibilities empowered through technology.
