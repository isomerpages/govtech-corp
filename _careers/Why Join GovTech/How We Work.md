<h3>What we strive for in our work</h3>
<p>Summary of how benefits for the below items, with focus on work culture,
mentorship, growth and flexibility. Here's how we work:</p>
<h4>Innovators of change</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Placeholders/Screenshot_2023_11_10_at_9_56_05_AM.png">
</div>
<p>We challenge ourselves to innovate and change things that are not meeting
our goals. Speak up, not follow instructions. We seek to deconstruct problems
on the fly and talk to users to solve problems. Help us get through tough
spots so that we develop the best solutions that will impact our users.</p>
<h4>Growth and Mentorship Opportunities</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Placeholders/Screenshot_2023_11_10_at_9_56_05_AM.png">
</div>
<p>Opportunities for learning and growth are enormous. You are surrounded
by a multidisciplinary group of experts across application development,
business, design, data analytics, hardware engineering, where you can share
and learn from each other. Take charge of your growth, and allocate time
to attend courses, meetups, and conferences. Not enough? Embark on a technical
mentorship to get guidance from technical experts locally and internationally.</p>
<h4>Tech Industry Programmes</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Placeholders/Screenshot_2023_11_10_at_9_56_05_AM.png">
</div>
<p>Keen for a learning stint in the private sector, you can take a six-month
learning stint with tech companies under our Digital Technology Attachment
Programme. You can also hop on our Digital Technical Mentorship Programme
and be matched with local or overseas technical mentors. These programmes
are critical in building our technical capabilities to deliver our mandate
of driving public digital transformation.</p>
<h4>Inspiring Environment</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Placeholders/Screenshot_2023_11_10_at_9_56_05_AM.png">
</div>
<p>We celebrate success together. We respect one another. We seek to build
a positive work environment. Help us rid of toxic work factors if you spot
any. We have also created a Smart Kampung where we can work, play and innovate
as one GovTech. Decorate your workspace if you like. Have your meetings
in co-working space. Chill out in the jamming and karaoke rooms.</p>
<h4>Flexible work arrangements and benefits</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Placeholders/Screenshot_2023_11_10_at_9_56_05_AM.png">
</div>
<p>We provide generous leave benefits to meet your needs for a balanced work
and family life. Work from home or exercise if you need to. Productivity
is higher than forcing you to sit at your desks and crank out work. We
trust that you will get the job done wherever you are, and whatever works
best for you.</p>
<h4>Our Culture and Values</h4>
<p>Innovation is a way of life at GovTech. We think big, start small, and
learn from failing fast. We have programmes to empower our GovTechies spark
collaboration and drive innovative projects for public good. Our Agile,
Bold, and Collaborative values unite us from different teams in delivering
the business outcomes in a growth-oriented workplace. They drive what we
build for our citizens, businesses, and public officers.</p>
