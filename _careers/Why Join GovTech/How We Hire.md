Paper applications are passé. Electronic applications save paper and reduce our carbon footprint at the same time.

If there’s an available role here that excites you, one that puts your skills to good use and lets you grow professionally, apply for it! (Electronically of course.)

**Focus on your CV** 
Make it easy to read: 
* Select a clean format which is logical and easy to read
*  Make good use of bold and italic typefaces to highlight accomplishments
    
**Put across accomplishments, not job descriptions**
* Share what you did in your role, not what the role was about
* Quantify and qualify your accomplishments - List accomplishments unique to you, not a list of what someone else or your contribution to a team. Highlight the benefits incurred as a result of what you did<br>
	*  Include all the relevant certifications in your CV<br>

2. Grab this opportunity to inquire deeper about the role or about us

3. Make a list of questions that you’d like us to answer. 
* We might not have all the answers during the interview, but we’ll definitely look for the answers and get back to you

 ##### Decision
