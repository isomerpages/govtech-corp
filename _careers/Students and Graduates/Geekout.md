<h3>Uniting young tech enthusiasts at GeekOut</h3>
<p>Imagine a tech bootcamp in Singapore that allows you to get hands-on with
the government's key technology offerings. That's GeekOut! Held every June,
this jampacked five-day event rallies junior college and polytechnic students
who live and breathe tech.</p>
<p>Enjoy a taste of what it’s like to be a GovTechie, and what it means to
embrace the company's ethos of being Agile, Bold and Collaborative. Partner
mentors and your newfound companions, dive deep into real-world applications
and solve challenges during a hackathon. Use our five capability centres’
technologies to engineer practical solutions for Singaporeans. You can
look forward to workshops helmed by experts and plenty of networking opportunities
too!</p>
