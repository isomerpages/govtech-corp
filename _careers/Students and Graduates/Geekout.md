### Uniting young tech enthusiasts at GeekOut

Imagine a tech bootcamp in Singapore that allows you to get hands-on with the government's key technology offerings. That's GeekOut! Held every June, this jampacked five-day event rallies junior college and polytechnic students who live and breathe tech.   

Enjoy a taste of what it’s like to be a GovTechie, and what it means to embrace the company's ethos of being Agile, Bold and Collaborative. Partner mentors and your newfound companions, dive deep into real-world applications and solve challenges during a hackathon. Use our five capability centres’ technologies to engineer practical solutions for Singaporeans. You can look forward to workshops helmed by experts and plenty of networking opportunities too!
