OpenDoc is an online document viewer created by GovTech for Ministries and Statutory Boards of the Singapore Government. It provides templates for websites, hosting and sharing of publicly accessible documents.

Public accessing documents on the OpenDoc platform can look forward to these key benefits:

*   **Readability** – with a responsive design, documents adapt to all types of devices, allowing for comfortable viewing anytime, anywhere;
    
*   **Searchability** – complex searches are executed at a high speed, ensuring that users get relevant and accurate content fast; and
    
*   **Accessibility** – documents can be accessed quickly without having to download files separately.
    

If you are interested in using OpenDoc for your public Government document, email us at [admin@opendoc.sg](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/opendoc/admin@opendoc.sg) with your name, agency, and information about the document you want to build or migrate.
