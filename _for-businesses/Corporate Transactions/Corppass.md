<p>From applying for grants to filing taxes, there are many administrative
transactions that corporate entities need to perform. As part of our vision
to become a Smart Nation, we aim to streamline these government-business
transactions. This has led to the birth of Corppass, an authorisation system
for entities to manage their employees' roles and access when transacting
with the government's digital services.</p>
<p>Corppass benefits local businesses and organisations that have a Unique
Entity Number (UEN) as well as foreign entities. Today, the service is
used by more than 550,000 entities to conduct online transactions with
over 250 government services.</p>

<p>Business owners can now delegate their employees to transact with different
government agencies on their behalf, and also manage their separate roles
and access. This single platform offers convenience and flexibility.</p>
