<h2>Leveraging data science and artificial intelligence to improve cross-analysis and operational efficiency within the government</h2>
<p>Data has changed the world for the better. Armed with key insights, everyday
citizens can make informed decisions as they go about their daily lives.
For government agencies, data have also paved the way for evidence-based
policymaking.</p>
<p>The volume of data Singapore's public sector collects has increased exponentially
over the years. In order to be able to analyse and draw meaningful insights
from the endless streams of data, we need to unlock the power of technologies
such as artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>Always one to keep up with the latest trends, GovTech has created several
AI-enabled services, all aimed at increasing productivity and project success.</p>
<h3>Cybersecurity best practices for Large Language Models</h3>
<p>Across the entire government, the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is accelerating due to their potential to enhance government operations
and services. To ensure that government systems are designed with security
in mind, GovTech produced a <a href="/files/products-and-services/GovTech_Cybersecurity_Playbook_for_LLM_Applications.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LLM Cybersecurity Playbook</a>.</p>
<p>This playbook provides a recommended set of cybersecurity best practices
to guide agencies and industries in developing (including training and
fine-tuning), procuring, deploying (including integration), and using LLMs.
Given the evolving nature of the cybersecurity landscape and the early
stage of LLM adoption, we commit to regularly reviewing the playbook in
consultation with AI practitioners to ensure its ongoing relevance.</p>
