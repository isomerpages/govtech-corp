<h3><strong>Putting up our best cyber defences with proactive cybersecurity services</strong></h3>
<p>As part of its mission to Engineer a Digital Government, GovTech also
prioritises the need to defend Singapore's cyberspace and ensure cybersafety
for all. This includes developing a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity
capabilities that detect and respond against cyber threats, as well as
uncover cyber vulnerabilities, as well as working with various agencies
to implement secure architectures and provide cybersecurity governance
and technical guidance to ensure a safer, more secure Smart Nation.</p>
<h3><strong>Government Cybersecurity Operations Centre (GCSOC)</strong></h3>
<p>The Government Cybersecurity Operations Centre (GCSOC) is an integrated
initiative that aims to upgrade monitoring and detection technologies,
automate and augment cyber threat detection and response at scale, and
develop capabilities to proactively hunt for sophisticated threats. - GCSOC
aims to better secure the Government’s evolving Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) infrastructure, and guard against threats more effectively.
It centralises cybersecurity operations across government agencies, and
better leverages technologies in artificial intelligence and machine learning
to enhance security analytics.</p>
<p>The Operations Centre has led to multiple benefits, such as improved detection
coverage, proactive threat hunting and and faster response times. An example
of GCSOC's work is PhishMonSG, a phishing detection tool developed in collaboration
with the Ministry of Home Affairs that enables GCSOC to proactively scan
across the Internet daily for malicious sites that mimic Government agencies’
websites.</p>
