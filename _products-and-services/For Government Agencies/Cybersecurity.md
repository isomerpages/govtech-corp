<p>All our efforts to build an advanced digital government will be for nought
if our cyberspace and systems are vulnerable to attacks. That is why GovTech
sees strengthening our cyber defences as an apex priority.</p>
<p>We've spared no expense in developing a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity
capabilities that can detect and mitigate cyber threats and uncover vulnerabilities.
To bolster our ability, we work with various agencies to implement secure
architectures and provide cybersecurity governance as well as technical
guidance to shape an even safer, more secure Smart Nation.</p>

<p>When a cyber threat arises, action must be taken in a timely manner to
eliminate it. That is why the GCSOC is now providing government agencies
with support for triage and incident investigation.</p>
<p>The Government IT Security Incident Response (GITSIR) team has been assembled
to facilitate a tightly knitted investigation and an improved response
workflow. Their goal is to help shorten incident response time.</p>
