<p>Through our Digital Government Blueprint, we aspire to create a Digital
Government with a digitally confident public service workforce that is
“Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart” to enable a Digital Society
and Digital Economy - this includes the need for public officers to also
be able to continually upskill, adapt to new challenges and work more effectively
across agencies as well as with citizens and businesses in Singapore. This
is where our Knowledge and Training products come in.</p>

the advanced needs of public sector ICT&amp;SS professionals and the higher-level
ICT programmes offered by private training providers are not contextualised

for public service.</p>
