<h2>A secure infrastructure as the foundation of a powerful digital government</h2>
<p>In Singapore, there are over 150,000 public officers working across 16
ministries and 50-plus statutory boards. From custodians of confidential
data to developers of key digital services, our public officers access
and utilise the government's information communication technology (ICT)
products and services on a daily basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With cyber threats becoming more advanced, it is imperative that we step
up our security measures to protect our public officers from malicious
attacks. Our products are designed to be powerful, yet they work in a non-obstructive
way, allowing our officers to go about their daily activities without being
inconvenienced. Providing peace of mind, the products help mitigate the
risk of data loss as well as malware infections.</p>
