<h3>Why a strong ICT infrastructure is crucial for Singapore's digital government</h3>
<p>A strong, secure, and reliable ICT infrastructure is the very backbone
of Singapore's evolving digital government. It's crucial for the smooth
functioning of essential government services, underpinning key initiatives
such as government e-services, ambitious Smart Nation projects, and seamless
public sector operations.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, Singapore has witnessed a rise in sophisticated
cyber threats. In 2024, our nation was ranked 8th globally as a threat
source destination. Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) reported over 21 million
cyberattacks originating from compromised servers in Singapore in 2024,
the highest in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>In response, GovTech has been at the forefront of developing and implementing
cutting-edge solutions that effectively mitigate these threats and ensure
the continued, secure operation of crucial public services and fundamental
government functions. Our robust ICT solutions are vital not just in supporting
government agencies and transformative Smart Nation initiatives but also
in critical public services.</p>
<p>Plus, with cyber threats becoming more advanced, such as with the use
of artificial intelligence in phishing campaigns, it's imperative that
we enhance our ICT services and infrastructure to protect our public officers
and the integrity of government systems.</p>
<h4>Partnering with the public sector</h4>
<p>In Singapore, there are over 150,000 public officers working across 16
ministries and 50-plus statutory boards. From custodians of confidential
data to developers of key digital services, our public officers access
and utilise the government's ICT products and services on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
