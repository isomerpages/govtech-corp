<h2>Purple A11y: Enabling the development of more inclusive government digital services</h2>

<p>At GovTech, we champion the need to increase digital inclusion. A huge
part of that begins with helping our fellow agencies ensure that their
websites meet accessibility standards, and thus can be used easily by persons
with disabilities (PWD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>GovTech's Accessibility Enabling Team (A11y Team) hence set out to create
Purple A11y, an open-source, customisable and automated web accessibility
testing tool that allows software development teams to find and fix accessibility
problems.</p>
<p>The tool runs a bot that scans and analyses web pages for issues such
as an improper labeling of images or buttons. After the scan, the bot assesses
the impact rating of the accessibility issues to help webmasters decide
on the next steps.</p>
<p>To date, it has scanned over 500,000 pages and identified over 7.5 million
accessibility bugs to date.</p>
<h3>Why use Purple A11y?</h3>
<p>The tool allows public service officers to improve the accessibility of
their websites as well as streamline web management. Here's how.</p>
