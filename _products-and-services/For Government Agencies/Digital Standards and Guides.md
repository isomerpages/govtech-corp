<h3>Shaping a positive, consistent digital experience through digital standards and guides</h3>
<p>Singapore's repertoire of digital government services is always expanding,
as our sister agencies continue to identify areas where they can improve
citizens' lives. To ensure that the new offerings provide a user experience
that's consistent with their predecessors' – one that's secure, safe and
efficient – we have come up with the Digital Service Standards (DSS).</p>
<p>A requisite for all government agencies to follow when building a new
digital service, the DSS help to align their design thinking with the collective.
Doing so will ensure that the new services meet the criteria of being accessible,
inclusive, usable, and relevant as stipulated in our Digital Government
Blueprint.</p>

<h3>How do Digital Service Standards work?</h3>
<p>The Digital Service Standards help you design digital services that will
deliver greater impact for your users:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>User needs are first identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An outside-in and co-creation approach with benchmarks against international
best practices is taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Mystery-shopping" checks are conducted periodically by independent citizens
and businesses to assess the useability and accessibility of the services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
