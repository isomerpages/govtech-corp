<h3>Shaping a positive, consistent digital experience through digital standards and guides</h3>
<p>Singapore's repertoire of digital government services is always expanding,
as our sister agencies continue to identify areas where they can improve
citizens' lives. To ensure that the new offerings provide a user experience
that's consistent with their predecessors' – one that's secure, safe and
efficient – we have come up with the Digital Service Standards (DSS).</p>
<p>A requisite for all government agencies to follow when building a new
digital service, the DSS help to align their design thinking with the collective.
Doing so will ensure that the new services meet the criteria of being accessible,
inclusive, usable, and relevant as stipulated in our Digital Government
Blueprint.</p>
