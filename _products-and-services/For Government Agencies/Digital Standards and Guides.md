<h2>Shaping a positive, consistent digital experience through digital standards and guides</h2>
<p>Singapore's Digital Government vision of “digital to the core, and serves
with heart” brings digitalisation together with user-centricity and empathy.
Singapore's repertoire of digital government services is always expanding,
as our sister Government agencies are continuously identifying opportunities
to improve citizens' lives through digital technologies and services.</p>
<p>To ensure that the new offerings provide a user experience that's consistent
with their predecessors' – one that's secure, safe and efficient. To ensure
that these digital services are easy to use, seamless and relevant to citizens
and businesses, we have developed – we have come up with the Digital Service
Standards (DSS).</p>

<h3>How do Digital Service Standards work?</h3>
<p>The Digital Service Standards help you design digital services that will
deliver greater impact for your users:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>User needs are first identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An outside-in and co-creation approach with benchmarks against international
best practices is taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Mystery-shopping" checks are conducted periodically by independent citizens
and businesses to assess the useability and accessibility of the services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to use the Digital Service Standards?</h3>
