<h3>Ensuring a positive, consistent user experience through Digital Standards and Guides</h3>
<p>As the Singapore government rolls out more digital services, we need to
provide standards and guides to ensure a complete and consistent user experience
for users. This is important not only for adoption, but for the convenience
of citizens and businesses who use our digital services - especially as
99% of our services are now online end-to-end.</p>
<h3>Providing guidance for government agencies through the Digital Service Standards (DSS)</h3>
<p>DSS guide agencies to implement their digital services to meet the Digital
Government Blueprint (DGB) goal of delivering digital services that are
easy, seamless and relevant for our citizens and businesses. This is a
requirement for all government digital services that are being built, to
ensure consistency in the user experience.</p>

<h3>Why use DSS?</h3>
<p>To help public agencies design and deliver digital services that are accessible
and inclusive, usable, and relevant. User needs are identified in order
to design and deliver unified and consistent digital services to citizens
and businesses. Outside-in and co-creation approach with benchmarks against
international best practices to ensure DSS can help agencies uplift their
digital services. To ensure compliance with the DSS, usability checks are
conducted periodically by independent citizens and businesses to 'mystery-shop'
and check on the usability and accessibility of Government digital services
when benchmarked against DSS.</p>
