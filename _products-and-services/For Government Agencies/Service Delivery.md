<h4>Personal Alert Button (PAB)</h4>

<p>By 2030, the number of seniors living alone is projected to reach 83,000.
In a bid to help elderly persons live safely and independently, GovTech
invented the PAB, a hardware Internet of Things (IoT) device. Installed
in the homes of seniors currently living alone, this alert device allows
them to call for help in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>GatherSG is deployed in tandem with the PAB as the back-end case management
system, which is supported by telecare operators and staff from Senior
Activity Centres. With GatherSG, the personnel are alerted to new cases
that have arisen and can keep an eye on those that require follow-up.</p>
<p>To date, the combined system has provided assistance to over 100,000 vulnerable
elderly, 35,000 government rental flat tenants, and handled almost 400
life-threatening cases.</p>
