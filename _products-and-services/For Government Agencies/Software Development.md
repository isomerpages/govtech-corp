<h3><strong>Developing stacks to enable public officers to build digital government services with ease </strong></h3>
<p>As we build a Digital Government and digitalise government services, it
is important to ensure that they are being built in an efficient, secure
and consistent manner. These software act as common platforms for government
agencies to build their services within the same infrastructure with easier
exchange of data across the government and automated workflows to encourage
efficiency. Not only does this ensure productivity and efficiency within
the Government as we deploy new digital government services, it also ensures
a seamless, consistent and positive experience for the end-user and ensures
the necessary security measures are in place for the digital services.</p>
