<h2>Developing stacks that allow public officers to build digital government services with ease</h2>
<p>Government agencies are always brimming with ideas on how to utilise digital
services to better the lives of Singaporeans. While we encourage them to
take their ideas to launch, it is important to ensure that the new offerings
are being built in an efficient and secure manner.</p>
<p>As such, GovTech has introduced software programmes that enable agencies
to build their prototypes within a common infrastructure. These products
help facilitate an easy exchange of data across the government as well
as automate workflows to heighten efficiency. Ultimately, it ensures that
the end-user experience of a new digital service is consistent with that
of existing ones.</p>
