<h3><strong>Creating Digital Storage and Verification services to secure sharing of verified official documents </strong></h3>
<p>Digitalisation is a big part of our transition into a Smart Nation. As
communications go digital, a protocol is necessary in order to faciliate
the endorsement and transmission of crucial or sensitive documents between
the government and citizens. - The Digital Storage and Verification services
serve this need by helping us certify the validity of official documents,
while making sure we can access and archive important government documents
in one place.</p>
