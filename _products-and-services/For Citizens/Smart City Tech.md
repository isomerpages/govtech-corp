<h3>Improving vulnerable seniors' quality of life through Smart City Technology</h3>
<p>At GovTech, we envision a Smart Nation where technology acts as an equaliser
to give every citizen a chance to improve his or her quality of life. Driven
by our mission to build Tech for Public Good, we have undertaken meaningful
projects that impact diverse users with varied accessibility needs.</p>
<p>Our Smart City projects require us to experiment with hardware designs
and infrastructure developments as well as collaborate with industry partners
to pilot new technologies. Our efforts have borne fruit.</p>
<h3>Supporting the assisted living infrastructure</h3>
<p>One such project is the Government Assisted Living Ecosystem (GALE). We
designed, built and rolled out an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure
that enables the provision of caregiving services to vulnerable senior
citizens.</p>
<p>This ecosystem is buoyed by three technology and care layers, namely a
hardware IoT button called the Personal Alert Button (PAB), a Case Management
System (CMS) as well as a team of telecare operators working 24/7 and
<a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medical-and-care-facilities/senior_activity_centre" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Senior Activity Centre (SAC)</u> 
</a>staff.</p>
<h3>What are the initiatives piloted under GALE?</h3>

<h4>PAB: Giving seniors peace of mind as they live independently</h4>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The first successful use case under GALE, the PAB is an alert device that
can be easily installed in the homes of elderly folks. With it, elderly
folks can call for help in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>The PAB connects them to either a SAC or CareLine, which is a 24-hour
personal telecare service manned by Changi General Hospital. The telecare
operators will perform triage using the PAB's two-way communicative technology,
assess the situation and deploy first aiders.</p>
<h3>Case Management Systems (CMS) put to test during COVID-19</h3>

</div>
<p>At the heart of GALE is the CMS, which facilitates outreach to vulnerable
communities. During the Circuit Breaker period, it was enhanced with a
sub-system that empowered the Silver Generation Office (SGO) and their
volunteers to proactively check on 100,000 elderly folks and offer assistance
while concurrently highlighting cases that needed follow-up.</p>
<p>Another sub-system was key in supporting SGO's operations to encourage
the elderly to go for their vaccinations through channels such as house
visits and video conferences.</p>
<p>A third sub-system was created to help the Ministry of Social and Family
Development as well as the People's Association (PA) reach out to rental
tenants. Recruited volunteers were able to check on the well-being of some
35,000 rental tenants, offering assistance from food to finance and ensuring
that they did not slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>The CMS also further extended support to the Ministry of Finance, PA and
its partners to handle lower-income families' appeals or reissue requests
for the Grocery Vouchers.</p>

<p>The optimistic outcome of the PAB trial has led to a large-scale expansion.</p>

<h3><strong>Improving the quality of lives of Singaporeans through Smart City Technology</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>As part of its mission to harness technologies and improve lives, GovTech
designs, builds and implements government-wide Internet of Things (IoT)
infrastructure to support a range of Smart City applications. This includes
experimenting with hardware design on embedded platforms and robotics,
to infrastructure development and deployment on cloud management platforms,
collaborating with industry partners and research entities to pilot new
technologies aimed at improving the lives of our citizens - Part of our
Smart Nation drive is to create an inclusive society where every one has
a shot at using technology to improve quality of life. These partnerships
have delivered meaningful projects aimed at improving life for diverse
users with accessibility needs as part of our Tech for Good motto.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Explore our Smart City Tech Project: GALE</strong></h3>
<p>Government Assisted Living Ecosystem (GALE) is a large scale project that
employed IoT to create tools and an infrastructure of support system for
caregiving that helped our senior citizens in vulnerable positions. <strong>- </strong>GALE
consists of technology and care layers - i) hardware IoT button, the Personal
Alert Button (PAB) ii) Case Management System (CMS) and iii) 24 x 7 telecare
operators and SAC staff.</p>

<p>Personal Alert Button (PAB) is an alert device that can be installed in
an elderly’s home. It is hardware IoT button to trigger help in times of
emergency. When triggered, it connects the user to either <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medical-and-care-facilities/senior_activity_centre" class="waffle-rich-text-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Senior Activity Centre (SAC)</u></a> or
CareLine, which is a 24-hour telecare service provided by Changi General
Hospital (CGH). - The telecare operators will triage the situation accordingly
using the PAB's two-way communicative technology and send assistance accordingly

<p><u>GALE's case management technology put to test during Covid </u>- The
core layer that supports the GALE ecosystem is a Case Management System
that faciliates outreach to vulnerable communities - During Circuit Breaker,
GALE created a system that helped Silver Generation Office (SGO) and their
volunteers to proactively check on 100,000 elderly’s well-being and offer
assistance whilst concurrently surfacing cases that needed follow ups -
It also faciliated SGO's operations in engaging elderly in the vaccination
drive - MSF formed a similar outreach operation, tapping on PA and their
recruited volunteers to proactively check on 35,000 rental tenants well-being
and offer assistance - GALE CMS further extended to support MOF, PA and
its partners to handle appeal or re-issue requests of the Grocery Vouchers
to support the lower income families</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>What's the latest on GALE?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><u>PAB is a successful pilot to be expanded on a larger scale </u>- To
date, PAB under GALE has been piloted in 53 rental housing blocks, and
installed in more than 6,000 units - 415 medical, social and crime related
emergency cases have been handled successfully - Projections estimate that
the number of seniors living alone in Singapore will reach 83,000 by 2030.
This is a steep increase from 47,000 in 2016 - The GALE team is looking
for opportunities to expand beyond the 53 rental blocks to reach more vulnerable
communities needing help</p>
