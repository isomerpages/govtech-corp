<h2>Improving vulnerable seniors' quality of life through Smart City Technology</h2>
<p>At GovTech, we envision a Smart Nation where technology acts as an equaliser
to give every citizen a chance to improve his or her quality of life. Driven
by our mission to build Tech for Public Good, we have undertaken meaningful
projects that impact diverse users with varied accessibility needs.</p>
<p>Our Smart City projects require us to experiment with hardware designs
and infrastructure developments as well as collaborate with industry partners
to pilot new technologies. Our efforts have borne fruit.</p>
<h3>Supporting the assisted living infrastructure</h3>
<p>One such project is the Government Assisted Living Ecosystem (GALE). We
designed, built and rolled out an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure
that enables the provision of caregiving services to vulnerable senior
citizens.</p>
<p>This ecosystem is buoyed by three technology and care layers, namely a
hardware IoT button called the Personal Alert Button (PAB), a Case Management
System (CMS) as well as a team of telecare operators working 24/7 and

</a>staff.</p>
<h3>What are the initiatives piloted under GALE?</h3>

<h4>PAB: Giving seniors peace of mind as they live independently</h4>

</div>
<p>The first successful use case under GALE, the PAB is an alert device that
can be easily installed in the homes of elderly folks. With it, elderly
folks can call for help in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>The PAB connects them to either a SAC or CareLine, which is a 24-hour
personal telecare service manned by Changi General Hospital. The telecare
operators will perform triage using the PAB's two-way communicative technology,
assess the situation and deploy first aiders.</p>
<h4>Case Management Systems (CMS) put to test during COVID-19</h4>

<p>At the heart of GALE is the CMS, which facilitates outreach to vulnerable
communities. During the Circuit Breaker period, it was enhanced with a
sub-system that empowered the Silver Generation Office (SGO) and their
volunteers to proactively check on 100,000 elderly folks and offer assistance
while concurrently highlighting cases that needed follow-up.</p>
<p>Another sub-system was key in supporting SGO's operations to encourage
the elderly to go for their vaccinations through channels such as house
visits and video conferences.</p>
<p>A third sub-system was created to help the Ministry of Social and Family
Development as well as the People's Association (PA) reach out to rental
tenants. Recruited volunteers were able to check on the well-being of some
35,000 rental tenants, offering assistance from food to finance and ensuring
that they did not slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>The CMS also further extended support to the Ministry of Finance, PA and
its partners to handle lower-income families' appeals or reissue requests
for the Grocery Vouchers.</p>
