<h3>Tapping the collective intelligence of Singaporeans to shape policies and augment cybersecurity</h3>
<p>As the beneficiary of the government's policies, you're the best person
to provide feedback on gaps and suggest ways to bridge them. Also, as the
end-user of digital government services, you're the eyes and ears on the
ground who can spot and report cyber threats lurking in the systems.</p>
<p>Recognising the immense opportunities you and your fellow citizens can
bring to the table, GovTech has built a duo of crowdsourcing products to
tap your collective intelligence. Contribute meaningfully to mould Singapore's
policies and take ownership of the government digital services you use
everyday.</p>
