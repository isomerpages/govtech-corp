<h3><strong>Tapping into the collective intelligence of Singaporeans in a collaborative effort</strong></h3>
<p>As we build digital government products and services for citizens and
businesses in Singapore, it is important that we engage them in the development
process. They are ultimately the end-users of government services, so involving
their input and insights early or during the process of improving a product
is invaluable in ensuring we design for the end-user. These also allow
Singaporeans to become significant contributors and have collective ownership
of the products developed by the government for them, as they have their
voice heard.</p>
