<h2>Making government information available at your fingertips</h2>
<p>The government organises many distribution and awareness campaigns to
help Singaporeans navigate hard times. Periodically, it also introduces
new schemes to alleviate the rising cost of living. To make it easy for
citizens to access information on the social services, grants and resources
provided by over 23 agencies as well as receive their government payouts,
we've developed two key services under our Directories and Distribution
umbrella.</p>
