<h3>Digitalising Directories to make public service information available at your fingertips</h3>
<p>The onset of Covid challenges led to the creation of various support measures
that deal with the distribution of resources to citizens in need. Some
examples include the free distribution of masks, and test kits at the peak
of the pandemic, as well as more recent inventions of CDC vouchers to alleviate
the pressures of costs of living.</p>
<p>Resource distribution is an operational challenge that requires clear
communications on where the resources can be found. To ensure these public
service announcements reach citizens successfully, information must be
freely available to help citizens find their way to the resources available
to them.</p>
<p>To do so, GovTech created multiple Digital Directories which are databases
of resources online designed to help citizens find relevant resources that
are distributed across the country</p>
