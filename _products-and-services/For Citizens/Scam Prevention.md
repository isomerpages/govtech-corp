<p>With the proliferation of scam websites, there is a need to step up our
cybersecurity measures and protect users, especially the ones who are less
savvy. That is why we have invented the Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention
System (SATIS). Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), this platform
hunts, analyses and disrupts malicious websites such as bank phishing sites
and job scam sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SATIS is powered by a technology developed by GovTech â€” the recursive
Machine-Learning Site Evaluator (rMSE). This technology flags scam sites
that are sent to the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and/or Google for further
action.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of SATIS?</h3>
<p>SATIS provides three key benefits, as follows.</p>

<h3>How to use SATIS?</h3>
<p>Like all good cybersecurity measures, SATIS runs in the background and
does not require any additional action on your part. Here are two things
you can do to maximise its usefulness.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Contribute by reporting</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Help heighten the efficiency of the Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System by reporting scams via Scam Shield." src="/images/Products and Services/For citizens/SATIS_card_image_1_compressed.jpg">
</div>
<p>Heighten its efficiency by reporting any suspicious web activities via
the <a href="https://www.scamshield.org.sg/about-bot/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Scam Shield WhatsApp bot</u></a>,
or the <a href="https://form.gov.sg/63982e109841390011a59121" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Report a Scam Form</u></a>.</p>
<h4>2. Look out for sites disrupted by SATIS</h4>
<p></p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="The Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System will disrupt scam websites." src="/images/Products and Services/For citizens/rMSE_resized.jpg">
</div>
<p>Your browser will display a red screen by Google and a message from SPF,
or an error page, when you land on a scam site. Alert others of it.</p>
