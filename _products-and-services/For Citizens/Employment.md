<h3><strong>Helping Singaporeans land their dream jobs with MyCareersFuture</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Every working adult in Singapore is familiar with the arduous journey
of finding a job. Aiming to make job searching easier and more fruitful
is MyCareersFuture. An initiative by GovTech, this online government career
portal supports job seekers by matching their skills and competencies with
available job vacancies. To keep the platform up to date with the latest
technology, we leveraged <a href="https://medium.com/dsaid-govtech/generating-job-recommendations-for-jobseekers-on-mycareersfuture-699c82cf6463" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>artificial intelligence and data science</u></a> to
enhance the job-matching process. By learning their past searches and mining
data about their job experiences and qualifications, the platform is capable
of predicting and suggesting job recommendations that users may not have
searched for, but could be of interest.
<br>
<br>On average, the portal holds over 80,000 job postings and serves over
280,000 individuals and 50,000 employers. Besides facilitating job matching,
the portal also benefits job seekers and hirers with its database of insights
on job searching, career development, talent acquisition and more.</p>
