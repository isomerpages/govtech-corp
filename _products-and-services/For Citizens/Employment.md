<p>Every working adult in Singapore is familiar with the arduous journey
of finding a job. Aiming to make job searching easier and more fruitful
is MyCareersFuture.</p>
<p>An initiative by GovTech, this online government career portal supports
job seekers by matching their skills and competencies with available job
vacancies. To keep the platform up to date with the latest technology,
we leveraged <a href="https://medium.com/dsaid-govtech/generating-job-recommendations-for-jobseekers-on-mycareersfuture-699c82cf6463" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>artificial intelligence and data science</u></a> to
enhance the job-matching process.</p>
<p>By learning their past searches and mining data about their job experiences
and qualifications, the platform is capable of predicting and suggesting
job recommendations that users may not have searched for, but could be
of interest.
<br>
<br>On average, the portal holds over 80,000 job postings and serves over
280,000 individuals and 50,000 employers. Besides facilitating job matching,
the portal also benefits job seekers and hirers with its database of insights
on job searching, career development, talent acquisition and more.</p>
