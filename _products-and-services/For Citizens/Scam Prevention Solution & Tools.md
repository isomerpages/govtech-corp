<p>Scam prevention is a critical aspect of navigating today's digital landscape.
As online interactions become increasingly prevalent, so does the risk
of encountering sophisticated scams designed to deceive and defraud individuals.</p>
<p>GovTech is committed to empowering Singaporeans with robust scam prevention
solutions aimed at safeguarding everyone from pervasive online threats.
Our focus includes providing tools and resources to effectively prevent
phishing attempts and identify website fraud detection mechanisms, ultimately
protecting citizens from falling victim to scam website detector schemes
and other malicious online activities.</p>
<h3>Trends of online scams in Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore faces a growing threat from online scams. In 2024, scam cases
rose by 10.6% to 51,501, resulting in at least $1.1 billion in losses —
a 70.6% increase. These alarming figures are fuelled by increasingly sophisticated
tactics.</p>
<p>Common <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/top-five-scams-in-singapore-and-how-to-protect-yourself/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>scams in Singapore</u></a> frequently
involve phishing, where fraudsters impersonate trusted entities to steal
data. Learning how to avoid getting scammed online is crucial as they create
convincing scam website detector traps and exploit online vulnerabilities.
These trends highlight the urgent need for proactive scam prevention measures
and greater public awareness to combat these evolving deceptions.</p>
<h3>How to protect citizens’ online security</h3>
<p>While scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated, our defences are
also evolving. GovTech is committed to providing cutting-edge scam prevention
solutions that not only detect and prevent phishing but also actively combat
a wide range of online threats, ensuring a safer digital environment for
all. By leveraging advanced technologies like AI, our tools actively identify
and neutralise fraudulent activities, including sophisticated scam website
detector schemes.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at our key scam prevention solutions:</p>
<h4>Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AI-powered platform aiding the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in combating
scam websites.</p>
</li>
<li>

daily for potential scams.</p>
</li>

</li>

<h3>Risks of online scams</h3>
<p>The proliferation of online scams in Singapore presents significant risks
beyond mere financial losses. Victims often suffer emotional distress,
reputational damage, and the compromise of sensitive personal data, which
can be exploited for further malicious activities. The evolving sophistication
of these scams, including AI-powered deceptions and social engineering
tactics, makes detection increasingly challenging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effective online scam prevention is, therefore, critical in Singapore
to safeguard individuals, maintain trust in the digital ecosystem, and
protect the nation's overall cybersecurity posture. Failure to address
this growing threat can undermine public confidence in online services
and hinder <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/our-enhanced-smart-nation-vision-paving-the-way-for-a-new-digital-era/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singapore's Smart Nation</u></a> ambitions.</p>
