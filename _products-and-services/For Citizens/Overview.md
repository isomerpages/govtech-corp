<h3><strong>Our Services for Citizens</strong> </h3>
<p>The future of Singapore is one where technology helps us create endless
possibilities beyond what we could imagined possible. As part of our DGB
journey to become a Smart Nation, citizen services is core to what we do
to drive and enable adoption of digital and smart technologies throughout
Singapore. This ranges from Digital Transactions to Smart City Technologies
- all for the benefit of citizens. Some examples include the Singpass app,
SGFinDex and the GoWhere directory of government websites. See how our
products have enhanced everyday lives.</p>
