<h3>Let's engineer a digital government together</h3>
<p>Digital government transformation is all about harnessing cutting-edge
technologies to drive significant improvements as well as empower citizens
and businesses in Singapore. At GovTech, we aim to lend our expertise not
only in the form of product development but also in event collaborations
to promote knowledge and idea-sharing.</p>
<p>Explore our past collaborations to see how we can work together to shake
up the status quo and bring immense benefit to our users.</p>
<h3>Product collaborations</h3>
<p>We welcome product-related collaborations. This could involve picking
the brains of our experts for product development, onboarding your services
onto one of our apps such as Singpass or LifeSG, or even tapping our tech-savvy
communities to gather feedback on your products.</p>
<h3>Product development</h3>
<p>From the Ministry of Education (MOE) to the National Environment Agency
and Singapore Food Agency (SFA), GovTech has collaborated with a myriad
of government agencies to develop innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
