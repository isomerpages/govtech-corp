<h3><strong>Let's engineer a digital government together</strong></h3>
<p>- As we transform Singapore through technology, digital government transformation
is all about harnessing technologies to enable significant improvements
and empower how we serve citizens and businesses in Singapore. - At GovTech,
we aim to lend our expertise not only in the form of product development,
but also event collaborations to promote knowledge- and idea-sharing within
the government. - Explore our collaborations to see how we can work together
to provide value.</p>
<h3><strong>Product Collaborations</strong></h3>
<p>Work with us on product-related collaborations. This could involve tapping
onto our experts for product developments, onboarding your services onto
one of our apps like Singpass or LifeSG, or even tapping on our communities
to test your products. From MOE to NEA and MOH, GovTech has collaborated
with a myriad of government agencies to develop products and services -
explore a few of these below.</p>
<p>1. Parents Gateway App - Include image of app (screenshots) - In collaboration
with MOE, this app is a one-stop portal used to disseminate information
and seek parents’ consent on admin matters, in a consolidated digital form.
It gives parents greater access and control over their child’s participation
in school activities and for parents to better manage school-related administrative
tasks. - With over 100,000 downloads and counting, this app has been an
invaluable tool that strengthens school-home partnerships in support of
children in their education journey - Learn more about this collaboration <u>here</u>.

<p>2. SPOT Robot - Include image of robot from <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/meet-spot-the-safe-distancing-robot-on-trial-in-bishan-amk-park" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/meet-spot-the-safe-distancing-robot-on-trial-in-bishan-amk-park</u></a> -
In collaboration with NParks, this played a role in the safe distancing
measures put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. - Fitted with cameras,
SPOT assisted to broadcast a recorded message to remind park patrons of
the safe distance measures to be observed. With its video analytics capabilities,
it could also provide insight into the number of patrons currently at the
park, again to aid with crowd control during the pandemic. - Learn more

<p>3. AI for Fish Farming - Include screenshot image from <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/meet-spot-the-safe-distancing-robot-on-trial-in-bishan-amk-park" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/how-ai-and-a-camera-phone-help-keep-food-on-our-tables</u></a> -
In collaboration with SFA, GovTech developed an AI tool to cut down on
manhours needed for the process of rotifer-counting - a necessary but time-consuming
activity in fish farming. With this AI tool, fish farmers now have an app
that can analyse uploaded images and provide the required insights, cutting
down the time needed for this process from 40 minutes to just 1 minute.
- This project was also awarded the Ministry of Sustainability and the
Environment (MSE) Innovation Award in 2020. - Learn more about this collaboration

<p><u>Product testing </u>- Include Tech Kaki Community image (showing product/user
testing in action) - Tap on our Tech Kaki Community (Link to Tech Kaki
Community page) to conduct user testings for your products and gather valuable
feedback. - Set up in 2016, this was a citizen community meant to ensure
that government digital products and services actually meet the needs of
citizens and businesses. - Leverage on our 7,000-strong community, ready
to give you insight and inspire impactful improvements in your products
and services.</p>
