<h3>Let's engineer a digital government together</h3>
<p>As we transform Singapore through technology, digital government transformation
is all about harnessing technologies to enable significant improvements
and empower how we serve citizens and businesses in Singapore. At GovTech,
we aim to lend our expertise not only in the form of product development
but also in event collaborations to promote knowledge- and idea-sharing
within the government. Explore our collaborations to see how we can work
together to provide value.</p>
<h3>Product Collaborations</h3>
<p>Work with us on product-related collaborations. This could involve tapping
onto our experts for product development, onboarding your services onto
one of our apps like Singpass or LifeSG, or even tapping into our communities
to test your products. From MOE to NEA and MOH, GovTech has collaborated
with a myriad of government agencies to develop products and services -
explore a few of these below.</p>
