<h2>Paving the way forward through knowledge sharing</h2>
<p>GovTech believes in the power of mutual growth. Using our clout as a government
agency in the tech industry, we are able to invite foreign luminaries to
our events as well as initiate partnerships with globally renowned companies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we regularly send our GovTechies on knowledge-exchange trips
so that they can collaborate with the international community as well as
identify opportunities for collaboration.</p>

</div>
<p>The Digital Government Exchange (DGX) is an annual global gathering of
Government Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and public sector leaders
from jurisdictions that have made significant progress in digital government.
Organised by Singapore’s Smart Nation and Digital Government Group since
2016, DGX is a one-of-its-kind international platform that has developed
a community of like-minded leaders who can engage in information exchange,
sharing of experiences, and mutual learning, while exploring future collaboration
opportunities.</p>
<p>Past participants involved representatives from government bodies as well
as multilateral institutions. They include Australia, Canada, China (Shanghai),
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands
(Amsterdam), Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (USA),
the United Nations (UN), the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the World Bank.</p>
<p>The ninth edition of DGX serves as a significant annual international
gathering of Government Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and public sector
leaders from advanced economies, including Australia, the Netherlands (Amsterdam),
Canada, China (Shanghai), Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Israel, Japan,
New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK), and the U.S. (New York).
This event offers a platform for participating governments to exchange
insights and experiences related to their digital government initiatives
in their respective countries.</p>

</div>
<p>Our team from the <a href="/our-capabilities/smart-city-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart City Technology Division</a>,
in collaboration with JTC Corporation and ST Engineering, represented Singapore
at the prestigious Smart City Expo World Congress (SCEWC). This event,
recognised as the largest and most influential gathering on urban innovation,
connects leaders from the most forward-thinking companies, governments,
and organisations to drive the future of urban living.</p>
<p><strong>Highlighting Singapore’s digital ambitions</strong>
</p>
<p>At the expo, the team showcased several groundbreaking projects that underline
Singapore's commitment to digital advancement:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Transforming urban living with Open-Robotics Middle Framework (Open-RMF):</strong>
</p>
<p>Open-RMF facilitates seamless interactions between robots and building
systems. By ensuring that robots can effectively coordinate with elements
like lifts, turnstiles, and doors, this technology prevents conflicts between
different robot fleets and enhances the integration of robotics in daily
urban life.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Tech-Enabled Assisted Living:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/products-and-services/for-citizens/smart-city-tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government Assisted Living Ecosystem (GALE)</a>: </strong>GALE
offers a comprehensive health monitoring solution for seniors, allowing
them to enjoy peace of mind while living independently at home. This system
is designed to support the elderly by providing convenient health tracking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wireless Alert Alarm System (AAS): </strong>The AAS provides a
critical support system for seniors living alone in public rental flats.
With Personal Alert Buttons (PABs), elderly residents can easily signal
for help from Senior Activity Centres (SAC) and tele-care operators during
emergencies. This initiative addresses the challenges of an ageing population
by optimizing tech solutions for elderly care.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. <strong>Tech-Enabled Assisted Living with the Sensei Care Kit:</strong>
</p>
<p>This innovative care kit integrates various health monitoring devices,
such as blood pressure monitors and weight scales, allowing seniors to
comprehensively track their health from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Tech-Enhanced Healthcare with Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG):</strong>
</p>
<p>GovTech is exploring the potential of rPPG technology to monitor vital
signs like heart rate and respiratory rate remotely. This cutting-edge
technology could significantly improve the early detection and treatment
of health issues, contributing to better healthcare outcomes in the future.</p>
<p>These initiatives not only demonstrate Singapore’s advancements in smart
city technologies but also reflect a commitment to enhancing the quality
of life for its citizens through innovative solutions. The participation
at SCEWC underscores Singapore's role as a leader in urban innovation,
striving to create a smarter and more connected urban environment.</p>
