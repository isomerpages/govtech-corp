<h3>Paving the way forward through knowledge sharing</h3>
<p>GovTech believes in mutual growth through knowledge and idea sharing.
To facilitate this exchange, GovTech is keen on going beyond the borders
to collaborate with the international community as well collaborations
such as events and other partnerships.</p>
<h3>Collaboration opportunities</h3>
<p>GovTech is open to various international collaborations, be it events
like talks and conferences, partnerships, MoU (memorandum of understanding),
and more.</p>
<p>Our multi-pronged international partnerships approaches include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Bilateral: Hosting foreign delegations keen to learn from our experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multilateral: Engagement of international organisations and governments,
and participation in global forums for international cooperation on Digital
Government by the United Nations, the World Bank and the European Union.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-Profit Organisations and Civil Societies: Sharing Singapore’s digital
transformation journey of the public sector at platforms such as the World
Economic Forum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge sharing via the Singapore Government Developer Portal: The portal
is a repository of detailed information of the products, solutions and
guidelines we have developed over the years to support Digital Government
transformation.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore actively participates in platforms by giving keynote talks and
conducting workshops. We believe such engagements will serve a much larger
community of countries looking to learn about Singapore’s journey.</p>
