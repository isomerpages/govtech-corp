<h2>Paving the way forward through knowledge sharing</h2>
<p>GovTech believes in the power of mutual growth. Using our clout as a government
agency in the tech industry, we are able to invite foreign luminaries to
our events as well as initiate partnerships with globally renowned companies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we regularly send our GovTechies on knowledge-exchange trips
so that they can collaborate with the international community as well as
identify opportunities for collaboration.</p>
