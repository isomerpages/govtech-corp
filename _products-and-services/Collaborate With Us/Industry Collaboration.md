<h2>Co-create with us to build our Smart Nation</h2>
<p>GovTech is committed to exploring new ways to deliver digital services
for citizens, businesses and government agencies. To do this, we're always
open to collaborating with industry stakeholders and researchers who share
a common goal of realising Singapore's Smart Nation ambitions.</p>
<p>Whether it is through technology partnerships or hosting events, we aim
to share our knowledge with as well as learn from our collaborators, so
that together we can raise the nation's collective digital capability.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dynamic nature of today’s technological and social landscape requires
the government to be more agile. Engaging our industry partners allows
us to tap the complementary strengths of the public and private sectors,
and I hope this close partnership will ensure a smooth journey together
on the next bound of Smart Nation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Mr Goh Wei Boon, Chief Executive, GovTech</p>
