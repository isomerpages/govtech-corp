<h3>ICT&amp;SS Policy Reform</h3>
<p>To support Singapore's Smart Nation initiative, GovTech is enhancing digital
transformation by improving service delivery, operations, and policy management
to protect ICT systems. The <a href="https://info.standards.tech.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ICT&amp;SS Policy Reform</a> focuses
on lean, relevant, and effective policy controls, starting with low-risk
systems. This initiative encourages collaboration between government agencies
and industry partners to develop rapid, cost-effective, and innovative
ICT systems, while ensuring that appropriate risk controls are in place.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://info.standards.tech.gov.sg/control-catalog/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">catalog of controls</a> provides
a comprehensive list of guidelines and standards designed to ensure the
secure and effective use of ICT assets in government operations. These
controls address various aspects of technology management, including security,
privacy, data integrity, and system reliability. These controls help government
agencies manage risks and implement innovative solutions efficiently, while
maintaining compliance with regulatory and policy requirements.</p>
