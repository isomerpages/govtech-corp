<p>This is an award-winning smart city operating system that integrates various
district management operations onto a single platform, such as facilities,
district cooling systems, security systems, carpark systems and more. To
kick things off, Punggol Digital District was created with ODP as its digital
backbone, where data is collected and operational activities can be managed
on a centralised platform. Moving forward, this product can empower estate
managers and ease the delivery of estate services.</p>
