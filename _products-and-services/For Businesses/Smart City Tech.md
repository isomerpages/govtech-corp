<p>In order for us to build a truly Smart Nation, we need to constantly push
the envelope. In this regard, we're proud to have partnered with JTC and
developed the Open Digital Platform (ODP), a proprietary and one-of-its-kind
smart city operating system that integrates various district management
operations.</p>
<p>Boasting digital twin capabilities, the ODP can manage district cooling,
security, car park systems and more, and even make robotic automation a
reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already an award-winning technology, the ODP serves as the digital backbone
of the upcoming Punggol Digital District (PDD). Streams of data are collected
in real-time to help facility managers, security personnel and the like
to deliver smooth estate services and optimise their critical operations.</p>

<p>Ahead of its 2024 rollout in PDD, the ODP has already been deployed at
The JTC Summit and Woodlands North Coast since 2022 and 2023 respectively.
We are also looking to enhance the platform so that it can be scaled up

solution.</p>
