<p>As an industry partner and vendor, you’re invited to discover the type
of work we do, partnership opportunities and how you can secure them.</p>
<h3>What is GovTech and who are our partners?</h3>
<p>GovTech is the lead agency driving Singapore's Smart Nation vision. We
aim to empower our nation with possibilities through infocomm technology
and related engineering technology, with our mission being "Engineering
Digital Government, Making Lives Better".</p>
<p>We develop an array of products for citizens, businesses and the Whole
of Government (WOG), which include Singpass, GoBusiness, LifeSG and more.
To learn more about what GovTech has developed as part of the Digital Government
Transformation, visit our <a href="/products-and-services/for-citizens/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Products and Services</a> page.</p>
<p>We also believe in the power of collaboration and strive to work with
the industry and research ecosystem through various initiatives that drive
our Smart Nation ambition.</p>
<p>Through the annual Industry Briefing for vendors, we invite you to bid
for upcoming projects, whether large- or small-scale, regardless of the
size of your business.</p>
<h3>Why partner with us?</h3>
<p>As a partner, you’ll leave a lasting impact on citizens and businesses
by co-creating and co-developing technologies for public good. Through
our work together, you’ll get to familiarise yourself with the Singapore
government’s ICT operating environment.</p>
<p>Your business also benefits from building digital capabilities, experience
and know-how in the public sector domain. The fruits of your efforts can
be applied in other areas and markets, bringing more growth to your organisation.</p>
<p>In addition, your business can achieve validation opportunities through
test bedding in actual deployment environments.</p>
<h3>Partnership opportunities</h3>
<p>We are currently focusing on ICT opportunities in 3 areas: Application
Development, Sustainability and Smart Cities.</p>
