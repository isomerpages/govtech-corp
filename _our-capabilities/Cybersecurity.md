<h3>Our Work and Initiatives</h3>
<p>We safeguard our country from heightened cyber threats made against government
agencies globally by:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancing cybersecurity defence capabilities in the Singapore government</strong>,
including managing security incidents in its Government IT Security Incident
Response Team and developing a new cybersquatting tool to monitor the web
for new websites with similar domain names and content to those of our
agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building cybersecurity capacity and advanced engineering in WOG</strong>,
such as developing a common Government Trust-based Architecture framework
and security testing for COVID-19 projects against compressed timelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developing talent and engaging the communities</strong> through
participation in international competitions, conducting exchange programmes
among Government Chief Information Security Officers, and organising hackathons.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We also augment government capabilities by engaging the larger cybersecurity
ecosystem and forging industry partnerships. Some of these initiatives
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Active collaboration with external partners</strong> to train our
cybersecurity specialists and conduct research and development for cyber
projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Partnering with the white hat community and members of the public</strong> through
the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/report_vulnerability" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Vulnerability Disclosure Programme</a>,
Government Bug Bounty Programme and <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/media-releases/2021-08-31-new-vulnerability-rewards-programme" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Vulnerability Rewards Programme</a> to
encourage responsible reporting of suspected vulnerabilities and weaknesses
in the government systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>As a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authority, CSG ensures a robust and efficient vulnerability disclosure process</strong> for
GovTech reported vulnerabilities to be assigned with a CVE promptly so
that affected Government agencies and product companies can be alerted
earlier to release fixes quickly.</p>
