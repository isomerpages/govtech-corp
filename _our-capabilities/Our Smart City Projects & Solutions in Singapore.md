<h2>Designing, building and implementing government-wide Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures for Smart City applications</h2>
<p>As the smartest Asian city and seventh in the world, Singapore leads the
way in leveraging technology to enhance citizens' lives and drive economic
growth. Our nation's commitment to innovation has fostered a dynamic landscape
of smart city projects across diverse sectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As 70% of the world's population is projected to reside in urban
areas by 2050, the need for efficient urban management becomes increasingly
vital. Smart city projects can offer crucial solutions that address the
challenges of growing urban density—including traffic congestion, environmental
sustainability, and public safety. These technologies optimise resource
allocation, effectively manage infrastructure, and ensure a higher quality
of life for residents.</p>
<p>GovTech plays a pivotal role in shaping this landscape, developing and
implementing essential smart city solutions in Singapore that underpin
many of these initiatives. From building robust IoT infrastructures to
infrastructure development, GovTech is dedicated to creating a digitally
empowered future for Singapore.</p>
