<p><strong>1. What does Data Science and Artificial Intelligence do? </strong>
</p>
<p>- The Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) was established
as a capability centre to enable GovTech and the whole-of-government (WOG)
to formulate effective policies and deliver citizen-centric services through
data-driven insights and decision-making. This will allow evidence-based
policy making, enhanced productivity in public service provision and better
targeted services to meet citizens’ needs.</p>
<p>- We work with government agencies in using data science and artificial
intelligence to improve policy outcomes, service delivery and operational
efficiency, as well as build intelligent platforms to add value to the
work of partner agencies. We also support other agencies in building in-house
data science expertise, formulating data strategies and setting up the
necessary data infrastructure.</p>
<p>- Our expertise can be categorised into 5 areas</p>
<p>- Quantitative Strategy, Capability Development, Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Platforms, Video Analytics and Data Engineering. We are driven by
the “so what” and make sure that our findings and models can be translated
into tangible impact. We start small and move fast; if a product works,
we would scale them. If not, we would examine what could have gone wrong
and what could be done better next time.</p>
<p><strong>2. Our Work and Initiatives </strong>
</p>
<p>- DSAID has been instrumental in supporting WOG digital transformation
and delivering #techforpublicgood, specifically through:</p>
<p>1. Government agency DSAI consultancy projects</p>
<p>2. Incubation of AI tech solutions such as Vigilant Gantry, an automated
temperature screening access control system that also interfaces with face
recognition for identification.</p>
<p>3. Development and deployment of data-driven products and WOG platforms
such as a central and secure data exploitation platform Empower public
officers and agencies to be more data-driven, through building up a strong
data community and spearheading data training, bootcamps, and competitions.</p>

<p>We support agencies in building in-house data science expertise, formulating

<p>We are organised into five teams - Quantitative Strategy, Capability Development,
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platforms, Video Analytics and Data Engineering
– that work in a fast-paced and an outcome-driven manner. We are driven
by the “so what” and make sure that our findings and models can be translated
into tangible impact. We start small and move fast; if a product works,
we would scale them. If not, we would examine what could have gone wrong
and what could be done better next time.</p>
<p>Working in evolving tech fields requires our teams to learn continuously
about new architectures, frameworks, technologies and languages, as well
as draw from the deep domain knowledge of partners and best practices from
our community of experts.</p>
