<h2>Activating human-centred design at the heart of building Government digital services</h2>
<p>The Design Practice is on a mission to make lives better for citizens,
businesses, and the public sector by activating human-centred design as
a core organisational capability in GovTech. We believe that technology
can be a force for public good by putting people at the heart of what we
do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We deliver on this mission by growing deep capabilities in human-centred
approaches to put people’s needs at the heart of building Government digital
services that address the problems of today and the future. We also support
our mission by championing the growth of our designers as well as best
practices and standards that guide the development of usable, accessible
and impactful digital services. If this resonates with you, partner with
