<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>The Data Engineering Practice (DP) serves as a main conduit for the transference
of data engineering expertise to the public sector, enabling agencies to
expand the quality, availability, and accessibility of their data. At DP,
we focus on three key areas to deliver great products for the <a href="/our-digital-government-efforts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Government</a>:</p>
<h4>1. Exploring technologies to conduct proof of concepts (POC)</h4>
<p>This involves evaluating emerging tools and methodologies to enhance our
data engineering capabilities. By investigating innovative solutions, we
can identify technologies that address specific business challenges and
yield valuable insights for future initiatives.</p>
<h4>2. Driving innovation to empower agencies through SME-led prototypes and pilots</h4>
<p>This focuses on providing Subject Matter Expert (SME) consulting to agencies
for developing and testing scalable prototypes and conducting pilots. The
SME-driven approach demonstrates the feasibility and impact of innovative
solutions, engages stakeholders in real-world scenarios, gathers essential
feedback, mitigates risks, and fosters a culture of creativity, ultimately
delivering meaningful value through specialised guidance.</p>
<h4>3. Standardising best practices to drive efficiency and consistency</h4>
<p>This strives to create a more unified and efficient data engineering ecosystem
by establishing clear guidelines, templates and documentation for various
aspects of data engineering. By doing so, we can promote collaboration,
reduce errors, and improve overall data quality while fostering a culture
of innovation within a structured framework.</p>
