<h3>What does Data Science and Artificial Intelligence do?</h3>
<p>The Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) was established
as a capability centre to enable GovTech and the whole-of-government (WOG)
to formulate effective policies and deliver citizen-centric services through
data-driven insights and decision-making. This will allow evidence-based
policy making, enhanced productivity in public service provision and better
targeted services to meet citizens’ needs.</p>
<p>We work with government agencies in using data science and artificial
intelligence to improve policy outcomes, service delivery and operational
efficiency, as well as build intelligent platforms to add value to the
work of partner agencies. We also support other agencies in building in-house
data science expertise, formulating data strategies and setting up the
necessary data infrastructure.</p>
<p>Our expertise can be categorised into 5 areas:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Quantitative Strategy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capability Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platforms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video Analytics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Engineering</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We are driven by the “so what” and make sure that our findings and models
can be translated into tangible impact. We start small and move fast; if
a product works, we would scale them. If not, we would examine what could
have gone wrong and what could be done better next time.</p>
