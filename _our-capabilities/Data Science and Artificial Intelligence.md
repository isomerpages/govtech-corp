<blockquote>
<p>A capability centre that uses data-driven insights and decision-making
to formulate effective policies and deliver citizen-centric services.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>The Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) enables
GovTech and the whole-of-government (WOG) to engage in evidence-based policymaking,
enhance productivity in the public service and deliver better-targeted
services to meet citizens’ needs.</p>
<p>We also build intelligent platforms to add value to the work of partner
agencies and support other agencies in building in-house data science expertise,
formulating data strategies and setting up the necessary data infrastructure.</p>
<p>Our expertise can be categorised into 5 areas:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Quantitative Strategy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capability Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platforms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video Analytics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Engineering</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We are driven by the “so what” and make sure that our findings and models
can be translated into tangible impact. We start small and move fast; if
a product works, we would scale them. If not, we would examine what could
have gone wrong and what could be done better next time.</p>
<h3>Our work and initiatives</h3>
<p>DSAID has been instrumental in supporting WOG digital transformation and
delivering Tech for Public Good.</p>
<p>We also empower public officers and agencies to be more data-driven by
building a strong data community and spearheading data training, bootcamps,
and competitions.</p>
<p>Below details some of the work that we engage in.</p>
