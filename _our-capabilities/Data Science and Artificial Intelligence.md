<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>Our expertise in Data Science, Data Engineering, and AI enables GovTech
and the whole-of-government (WOG) to engage in evidence-based policymaking,
enhance productivity in the public service, and deliver better-targeted
services to meet citizens’ needs.</p>
<p>We also build intelligent platforms to add value to the work of partner
agencies and support other agencies in building in-house data science expertise,
formulating data strategies and setting up the necessary data infrastructure.</p>
<p>We are driven by the “so what” and make sure that our findings and models
can be translated into tangible impact. We start small and move fast; if
a product works, we would scale them. If not, we would examine what could
have gone wrong and what could be done better next time.</p>
