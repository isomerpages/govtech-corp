<h4><strong>Application Design, Development &amp; Deployment</strong></h4>
<p>The Application Design, Development &amp; Deployment capability centre,
anchored by the Government Digital Services (GDS) division at GovTech,
delivers citizen-centric solutions and creates a strong design and software
engineering foundation within the public service. It ensures the deployment
of well-designed and modern digital services and applications architecture,
using the latest technology and methodologies (such as Agile, user experience
design, quality engineering, DevOps and reusable digital services). Our
centre supports the government to continuously improve, integrate and deploy
human-centric digital services to our citizens while ensuring that these
services are scalable, resilient and reusable.</p>
<p>GDS upholds excellence by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Designing for users</strong>: We engage citizens, listen to feedback
regularly, and iteratively test products to understand usersâ€™ pain points
and enhance their products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineering with care</strong>: We build tech to last, investing
in maintainable systems and clean code. From inception to delivery, we
accelerate the process with open source libraries, modern technologies,
CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) and DevOps practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building inclusive products, inclusive teams</strong>: We build
for everybody and prioritise accessibility. Inclusive products start with
inclusive teams, so we believe in creating a supportive environment where
every individual can flourish.</p>

<p><strong>Going far, together</strong>: We are ambitious: not just wanting
to build great products, but to make a lasting impact on how the government
builds products. We have built trust and relationships with agencies to
