<h3>What does Cybersecurity do?</h3>
<p>The Cyber Security Group (CSG), established as a capability centre at
GovTech, drives a holistic and sustainable whole-of-government (WOG) approach
that delivers innovative and forward-thinking cybersecurity capabilities.
Our mandate is to safeguard the Singapore governmentâ€™s ICT&amp;SS (Information
and Communications Technology &amp; Smart Systems) and enable Singapore
to be a safe and secure Smart Nation.</p>
<p>We work with the owners of whole-of-government and Smart Nation Programmes
to implement secure architectures, and the Chief Information Security Officers
(CISOs) in agencies to provide cybersecurity governance and technical guidance.</p>
<p>Our expertise lies in specialising in a full spectrum of technical and
operational capabilities to counteract evolving cyber threats, enhancing
cybersecurity defence capabilities, building cybersecurity capacity and
advanced engineering in WOG and more.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities / Practices:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Government cybersecurity strategy &amp; policy</strong> - developing
strategies and establishing cybersecurity governance policies, standards
and guidelines for WOG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government cybersecurity consulting</strong> - providing cybersecurity
advisories like risk assessments and ensuring policy implementation for
government projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government cybersecurity defence</strong> - strengthening blue-teaming
capabilities through threat detection and incident response to protect
Government digital systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced cybersecurity capabilities</strong> - strengthening the
Government's cybersecurity capabilities through red-teaming, product development
and cybersecurity competency training.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Our Work and Initiatives</h3>
<p>We safeguard our country from heightened cyber threats made against government
agencies globally by:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancing cybersecurity defence capabilities in the Singapore government</strong>,
including managing security incidents in its Government IT Security Incident
Response Team and developing a new cybersquatting tool to monitor the web
for new websites with similar domain names and content to those of our
agencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building cybersecurity capacity and advanced engineering in WOG</strong>,
such as developing a common Government Trust-based Architecture framework
and security testing for COVID-19 projects against compressed timelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developing talent and engaging the communities</strong> through
participation in international competitions, conducting exchange programmes
among Government Chief Information Security Officers, and organising hackathons</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We also augment government capabilities by engaging the larger cybersecurity
ecosystem and forging industry partnerships. Some of these initiatives
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Active collaboration with external partners</strong> to train our
cybersecurity specialists and conduct research and development for cyber
projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Partnering with the white hat community and members of the public</strong> through
the Vulnerability Disclosure Programme, Government Bug Bounty Programme
and Vulnerability Rewards Programme to encourage responsible reporting
of suspected vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the government systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>As a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authority, CSG ensures a robust and efficient vulnerability disclosure process</strong> for
GovTech reported vulnerabilities to be assigned with a CVE promptly so
that affected Government agencies and product companies can be alerted
earlier to release fixes quickly</p>
</li>
</ul>
