Response Team and developing a new cybersquatting tool to monitor the web
for new websites with similar domain names and content to those of our
agencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building cybersecurity capacity and advanced engineering in WOG</strong>,
such as developing a common Government Trust-based Architecture framework
and security testing for COVID-19 projects against compressed timelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developing talent and engaging the communities</strong> through
participation in international competitions, conducting exchange programmes
among Government Chief Information Security Officers, and organising hackathons</p>
