<p>Singapore's digital landscape faces escalating threats, making robust
cybersecurity paramount. The severity of this challenge is underscored
by recent statistics: in 2023, 84% of local organisations reported cyberattacks,
with 53% resorting to ransom payments. In response, GovTech delivers critical
cyber security solutions. We are dedicated to cyber defence in Singapore,
safeguarding government Information and Communications Technology &amp;
Smart Systems through proactive threat detection and rapid response, fortifying
digital resilience.</p>

</p>
<h4>Who we work with</h4>
<p>We work with the wider cybersecurity community and industry partners.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborating with partners</strong>
</p>
<p>We collaborate with industry partners and institutes of higher learning
(IHLs) to leverage their expertise and best-of-breed solutions, which can
effectively meet the needs of Whole-of-Government. This includes joint
development of security protocols and access to specialised threat intelligence.
We also participate in industry-led cybersecurity forums for knowledge
exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Engaging with the white hat community</strong>
</p>
<p>We engage the wider white hat community through the Crowdsourced Vulnerability
Disclosure Programme to secure our systems and encourage responsible reporting
of suspected vulnerabilities found within government systems. This programme
adheres to ISO 29147 standards for vulnerability disclosure. Reported vulnerabilities
are assessed and remediated according to severity, ensuring system integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivating talents in cybersecurity</strong>
</p>
<p>We conduct regular Capture the Flag competitions to attract and challenge
cybersecurity enthusiasts on various aspects of cybersecurity, to hone
their skills, and learn from one another. These competitions simulate real-world
cyber scenarios and are aligned with industry certifications. Participants
gain practical experience in incident response and forensic analysis.</p>
<h3>Securing Singapore's digital future</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity is critical in Singapore due to its extensive digital infrastructure,
which is vital for essential services and the economy. In 2023, key trends
emerged: supply chain attacks, heightened hacktivism, and <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/generative-ai-where-can-it-go-wrong/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>risks of AI</u></a> facilitating
sophisticated <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/top-five-scams-in-singapore-and-how-to-protect-yourself/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>scams in Singapore</u></a>.
These are compounded by a cybersecurity talent shortage and the need for
agile defences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mitigate impacts on public services, GovTech's Government Security
Operations Centre (GSOC) provides 24/7 monitoring. Building upon this,
robust security protocols and proactive intelligence sharing significantly
enhance government system resilience. Furthermore, by deploying automation
and AI-driven solutions, GovTech strengthens defences, addresses the cybersecurity
talent gap, and reinforces trust in digital services. These combined efforts
demonstrate a tangible impact in safeguarding Singapore's digital future.</p>
