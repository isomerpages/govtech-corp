<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>The Smart City Technology (SCTD) division brings together the technologies,
capabilities and products to enable Singapore’s Smart City vision. Formerly
known as Sensors &amp; IoT (SIOT), this centre was renamed and reorganised

to infrastructure development and deployment on cloud management platforms.
With these technologies, we apply them in our projects to help improve
service delivery and better meet the needs of citizens and businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collaborate with the industry, research entities, and agencies to build
capabilities in IoT, pilot new sensor technologies, and solve IoT challenges.</p>
<p>In addition, we work closely with government agencies and industry partners
to understand their pain points and develop solutions to actual use cases.</p>
<h3>Our work and initiatives</h3>
<p>SCTD has delivered meaningful projects that serve the nation, as well
as prototyped solutions to meet the needs of diverse groups of users.</p>
