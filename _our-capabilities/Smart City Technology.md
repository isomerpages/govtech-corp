<h3>What does Smart City Technology do?</h3>
<p>The Smart City Technology (SCTD) division, established as a capability
centre, designs, builds, and implements a government-wide Internet of Things
(IoT) infrastructure to support a range of Smart City applications. Formerly
known as Sensors &amp; IoT (SIOT), this centre was renamed and reorganised
in January 2023 to better reflect GovTech’s focus in putting together the
technologies, capabilities, and products to enable Singapore’s Smart City
vision.</p>
<p>Our expertise ranges from hardware design on embedded platforms and robotics
to infrastructure development and deployment on cloud management platforms.
With these technologies, we apply them in our projects to help improve
service delivery and better meet the needs of citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>We also collaborate with the industry, research entities, and agencies
to build capabilities in IoT, pilot new sensor technologies, and solve
IoT challenges. - We also work closely with government agencies and industry
partners to understand their pain points and develop solutions to actual
use cases.</p>
<h3>Our Work and Initiatives</h3>
<p>SCTD has delivered meaningful projects that serve the nation, as well
as prototyped solutions to meet the needs of diverse groups of users:</p>
