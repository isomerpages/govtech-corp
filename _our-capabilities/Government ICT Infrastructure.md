<h3>What does Government ICT Infrastructure do?</h3>
<p>In GovTech, the Info-Communications Technology Infrastructure (ICT Infra)
capability centre, also known as the Government Infrastructure Group (GIG),
develops centralised ICT Infra for the whole-of-government (WOG).</p>
<p>We are unique in developing ICT Infra at scale and as the foundational
ICT layer that enables the entire government, impacting all government
agencies and public officers.</p>
<p>Our expertise lies in developing agile, secure, resilient and cost-effective
public sector ICT infra. Our diverse scope extends across data centres/hosting,
networks, digital workplace applications, end-user devices, IT support,
secure ICT Infra, and ICT Infra applications – and to engineer it together
and lead in optimising across performance-security-cost for the government.
We tinker with new technologies to constantly improve the ICT experiences
for public officers and provide reference architectures, standards and
consultancy support to government agencies.</p>
<h3>Our Work and Initiatives</h3>
