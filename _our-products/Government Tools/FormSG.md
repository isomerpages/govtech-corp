[FormSG](https://form.gov.sg/#!/) is a form builder tool that enables public officers to create digital government forms in minutes, replacing the use of paper forms.

**Benefits to public officers and citizens**

FormSG allows integration with government systems, enabling it to support authentication using SingPass. FormSG has helped public officers to significantly reduce administrative efforts spent on transcribing physical paper forms. Pre-filling of form fields with MyInfo and authentication for companies using CorpPass will soon be made available on FormSG.

**Usage rates**

More than 6,000 public officers across over 65 agencies are currently using FormSG to push digitisation of their paper forms, with more than 1,200 forms built to date. As of March 2019, we have 6,804 public officers on our platform, 3,488 digital forms deployed, and 554,738 citizens filling up our forms.
