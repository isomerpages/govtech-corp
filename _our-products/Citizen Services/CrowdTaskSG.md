CrowdTaskSG is a crowdsourcing web portal that aims to tap the collective intelligence of Singaporeans regarding national issues to provide actionable insights to government agencies.

As a project that took shape back in 2019, its initial objective was to better connect citizens with government agencies. The common consensus was that citizens do not get their voices heard often enough and hence, CrowdTaskSG was created to bridge the gap between citizens and agencies, ensuring that they have a one-stop platform to share their opinions and ideas.

The portal currently supports the creation of surveys, and the auto distribution of them to a verified and diverse pool of citizens. All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 18 and above are able to access the portal with their Singpass account.

From its inception, the portal has since developed many key features, which include the following:

### Gamification elements

Citizens can earn experience points (XPs) when they complete tasks and surveys. XPs can be used to level up their ranks from Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold and finally, Platinum. These would eventually help prepare citizens for the upcoming leaderboard feature, whereby they will be able to see where they stand amongst other fellow Singaporeans.

### Incentivisation

From completing tasks, citizens can earn virtual coins too. These coins can then be accumulated to redeem rewards such as vouchers. The more surveys and tasks a citizen completes, the more they will be rewarded. In the future, the portal will be looking to expand its range of rewards to include cash straight into citizens’ GovWallet accounts.

CrowdTaskSG offers citizen users various opportunities to share opinions and feedback with government agencies.

For instance:

*   Participating in different tasks, such as surveys on topics related to government policies and national identity.
*   Testing out prototype products, such as new government websites or mobile apps, to give your feedback on areas of improvement.
*   Indicating your interest in focus group discussions according to your selected topics.
*   Having a say in new projects-in-the-making.

The current crowdsourcing landscape may be perceived as fragmented, making it difficult for Singaporeans to get an overview of all the opportunities out there while agencies have a hard time finding the right target participants.

CrowdTaskSG aims to solve the issues on both ends, with all government crowdsourcing tasks on one site.

Agencies can also make use of the targeted demographic screener function to reach their target demographic. For example, they can easily screen for older volunteers if they want to test how user-friendly a product is for elderly users.

The CrowdTaskSG team is also looking to include more variety of tasks, including polls and A/B testing, and is continually reaching out to the various agencies to determine how the platform can better support their crowdsourcing efforts.
