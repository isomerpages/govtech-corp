<h2>Open Digital Platform</h2>
<p><strong>Supported by GovTech. In partnership with JTC and ST Engineering.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Open Digital Platform (ODP), developed in partnership with JTC, is
a proprietary and one-of-its-kind smart city operating system that integrates
various district management operations. Boasting digital twin capabilities,
the ODP can manage district cooling, security, car park systems and more,
and even make robotic automation a reality.</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ODP serves as the digital backbone of the upcoming Punggol Digital District
(PDD). Streams of data are collected in real-time to help facility managers,
security personnel and other estate managers deliver smooth estate services
and optimise their critical operations. Centralisation of district operations
for better operations management is expected to reduce operational manpower,
and energy consumption <strong>by up to 30%.</strong>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Digital twin of PDD</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>This digital twin will include real-world data of the district, such as
power consumption, weather forecasts, and temperature readings.</p>
<p>With the digital twin, developers are able to run simulations of real-world
scenarios before actual implementations. For instance, developers can use
it to test new products and processes such as training the software of
autonomous vehicles.</p>

<summary><strong>Real-time data monitoring</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Ingesting data streams from various district management systems, these
data streams will then be processed and transformed in real-time allow
sense-making for greater situational awareness. It also analyses data from
different systems and sensors and uses AI such as machine learning to predict
and send commands to systems in response to real-world happenings.</p>
