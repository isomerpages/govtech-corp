<h2>Open Digital Platform</h2>
<p><strong>Supported by GovTech. In partnership with JTC and ST Engineering.</strong>

<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Open Digital Platform (ODP), developed in partnership with JTC, is
a proprietary and one-of-its-kind smart city operating system that integrates
various district management operations. Boasting digital twin capabilities,
the ODP can manage district cooling, security, car park systems and more,
and even make robotic automation a reality.</p>
<p>ODP serves as the digital backbone of the upcoming Punggol Digital District
(PDD). Streams of data are collected in real-time to help facility managers,
security personnel and the like to deliver smooth estate services and optimise
their critical operations.</p>
