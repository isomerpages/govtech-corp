<p>In collaboration with NParks, this is a website for citizens to learn
about our trees in Singapore and plot a tree anywhere in Singapore in their
name for the OneMillionTrees movement. This is a movement that aims to
plant a million more trees across Singapore over the next 10 years, as
part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and has succeeded in planting over
637,000 so far.</p>
