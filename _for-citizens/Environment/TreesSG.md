</p>
<p>Singapore is proudly a City in a Garden. To further enhance the greenery
and beautify our living spaces, National Parks Board (NParks) has launched
the <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement/about-the-movement" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OneMillionTrees movement</a> as
part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which pledges to add 1 million trees
to the population by the end of the decade. The movement has gained much
traction, with over 670,000 trees across 109 families and more than 1,680
species planted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you get acquainted with the multitude of trees in Singapore, we
collaborated with NParks to launch TreesSG. The website is a repository
of information on trees in Singapore. You can even plant a tree in your
name via TreesSG!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the website is tasked with improving the management of Singapore's
six million trees. To do this, we adopted a science-based approach and
developed ecosystems of digital tools and analytics, including automating
tree measurement extraction, to build digital twins of trees that are spatially,
semantically, and biologically accurate.</p>
<p>The digital twins help enhance field operations and improve risk management
effectiveness. Buoyed by it, arborists can focus on conducting physical
inspections on trees that require urgent attention.</p>
