<p>As an individual progresses in their financial planning journey, the number
of accounts with multiple financial institutions will increase in tandem.
This creates a complex challenge for financial planning as open sharing
of data across financial institutes is almost impossible.</p>
<p>With SGFinDex, GovTech worked with the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) in collaboration
with The Association of Banks in Singapore and seven participating banks
to create a secure way of consenting data sharing across institutes.</p>
<p>SGFinDex is the world's first public digital infrastructure that uses
a national digital identity and enables individuals to manage and access
financial information held across different government agencies and financial
institutions.</p>
<p>To date, SGFinDex has 150K users, connected 290K bank accounts and facilitated
620K data retrievals made across 16 financial institutions.</p>
