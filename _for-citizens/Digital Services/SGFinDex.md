<p>As you progress in your financial planning journey, you’ll likely sign
up for accounts with different financial institutions to achieve your varied
savings, investment and insurance goals. Before, reviewing your entire
financial portfolio would have been a cumbersome task, as there was no
ecosystem to facilitate data sharing among government agencies and financial
institutions.</p>
<p>But that has changed today. Working with the Monetary Authority of Singapore,
the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, The Association of Banks
in Singapore as well as 16 financial institutions, we have created Singapore
Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex). It is the world's first public digital
infrastructure that uses a national digital identity to allow individuals
to manage and access financial information held across different government
agencies and financial institutions.</p>
<p>To date, SGFinDex has 150,000 users, connected 290,000 bank accounts and
facilitated 620,000 data retrievals.</p>
