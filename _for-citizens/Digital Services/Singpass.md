<h4>Public Service Advisory on Scams</h4>
<p>Scams are on the rise, and they are becoming more sophisticated. You can
prevent yourself and others from becoming victims by remembering the following
tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check the message for spelling errors, which are an indicator that it
is sent from a spoof account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singpass will never send out SMSes with any weblinks, and will not ask
for your login action. If you receive any SMS with a weblink, do not click
on it and delete immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call the 24-hour scam hotline at 6335 3533 to verify the authenticity
of the message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reset your Singpass password if you suspect your account has been compromised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
