<p>Unsolicited SMSes with Senders claiming to be Singpass, asking the recipient
to login to their Singpass account via a spoofed Singpass login website.</p>
</li>

<h4>Stay vigilant by following these steps:</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Check if the Sender for spelling errors that indicates is a spoof account.</p>

<p>Do not click on links as Singpass does not send SMSes with web links asking
for your login action.</p>
