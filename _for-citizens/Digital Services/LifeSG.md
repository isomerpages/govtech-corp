<p>As we grow older, there are many different government services that we
will need to access at different moments of life.</p>
<p>To make life administration easy, LifeSG was created as an app that consolidates
services and information across various government agencies and provides
recommendations that are personalised according to user profiles and preferences.</p>
<p>LifeSG is one of the Strategic National Projects under Singapore’s Smart
Nation initiative from GovTech that is aimed at providing a suite of services
to support citizens’ needs at key junctures by integrating and bundling
services across government agencies.</p>
<p>It represents a major shift from e-government services that require users
to manage them individually, to one user-centric service that tailors itself
according to the citizen's life phase.</p>
<p>To date, LifeSG has managed to serve more than 1.5M app users with LifeSG,
supporting them through life's major milestones from birth to bereavement,
with over 100 government services readily tailored to their needs.</p>
