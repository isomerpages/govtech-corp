<hr>
<p>With the proliferation of scam websites, there is a need to step up our
cybersecurity measures and protect users, especially the ones who are less
savvy. That is why we have worked with SPF to develop Scam Analytics and
Tactical Intervention System (SATIS). Powered by artificial intelligence
(AI), this platform hunts, analyses and disrupts malicious websites such
as bank phishing sites and job scam sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SATIS is powered by an in-house AI/ML technology developed by GovTech
—recursive Machine-Learning Site Evaluator (rMSE). This technology alone
achieves an accuracy well in excess of 90% and is used to flags scam sites
for the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and/or Google to take further action.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits of SATIS?</h3>

<h3>How to use SATIS?</h3>
<p>Like all good cybersecurity measures, SATIS works in the background and
does not require any additional action on your part. Here are two things
you can do to maximise its usefulness.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Contribute by reporting</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Help heighten the efficiency of the Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System by reporting scams via Scam Shield." src="/images/Products and Services/For citizens/SATIS_card_image_1_compressed.jpg">
</div>
<p>Heighten its efficiency by reporting any suspicious web activities via
the <a href="https://www.scamshield.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield app.</a>
</p>
<h4>2. Look out for sites disrupted by SATIS</h4>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="The Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System will disrupt scam websites." src="/images/Products and Services/For citizens/rMSE_resized.jpg">
</div>
<p>If you land on a SATIS-disrupted scam website, you may see either:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A red warning screen from Google,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A message from SPF,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or a disconnected site (e.g. 404 error)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, scammers may find excuses to send you a different link
– please disengage with them!</p>
