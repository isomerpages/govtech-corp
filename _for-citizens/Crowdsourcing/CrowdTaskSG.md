<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>The problem: Limited citizen engagement in public decision making</h4>
<p>Despite our best efforts, there are times where citizens don't get to
actively participate in government decision-making. This limited engagement
can result in policies that may not fully reflect the diverse needs and
perspectives of the populace.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Why citizen input matters</h4>
<p>Creating a platform for citizen feedback to government is crucial for
improving public services and fostering transparency in several key ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Informed decision making:</strong> Collecting diverse opinions
ensures that policies are well-rounded and cater to the actual needs of
the community. Your participation in Singapore’s paid surveys directly
contributes to this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Building trust:</strong> Active participation fosters a sense of
ownership and trust between the government and its citizens. When your
voice is heard, it strengthens the bond between the people and their government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Regular feedback loops allow for
the ongoing refinement of services and policies, adapting to changing societal
needs. Your contributions through paid surveys in Singapore help drive
this continuous improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Much of what the Singapore government does is driven by the goal of bettering
your life. Being the beneficiary of government initiatives, you are the
best person to help identify gaps and areas of improvement across different
national policies and issues.</p>
<p>As part of our mission to build <a href="/our-digital-government-efforts/tech-for-public-good/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tech for Public Good</a>,
we want to empower government agencies and give them the ability to gather
valuable on-the-ground insights. Armed with the insights, they can then
chart roadmaps to take concrete actions. To do this, we came up with CrowdTaskSG,
a crowdsourcing web portal for agencies to co-create and co-deliver a verified
and diverse pool of Singaporean citizens. Citizens can share their insights
and feedback through surveys, and play their part in improving service
delivery.</p>
<p>Open to citizens and Permanent Residents aged 18 years old and above with
a Singpass account, CrowdTaskSG currently has more than 30,000 active users.
More than 80 government agencies have received over 290,000 insights from
users to date.</p>
