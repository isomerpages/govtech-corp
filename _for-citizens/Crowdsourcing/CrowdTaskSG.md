<p>Much of what the Singapore government does is driven by the goal of bettering
your life. Being the beneficiary of government initiatives, you are the
best person to help identify gaps and areas of improvement across different
national policies and issues.</p>
<p>As part of our mission to build <a href="/our-digital-government-efforts/tech-for-public-good/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tech for Public Good</a>,
we want to empower government agencies and give them the ability to gather
valuable on-the-ground insights. Armed with the insights, they can then
chart roadmaps to take concrete actions. To do this, we came up with CrowdTaskSG,
a crowdsourcing web portal for agencies to co-create and co-deliver a verified
and diverse pool of Singaporean citizens. Citizens can share their insights
and feedback through surveys, and play their part in improving service
delivery.</p>
<p>Open to citizens and Permanent Residents aged 18 years old and above with
a Singpass account, CrowdTaskSG currently has more than 30,000 active users.
More than 80 government agencies have received over 290,000 insights from
users to date.</p>
