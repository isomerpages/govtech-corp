<p>Cyber threats are increasingly becoming prevalent and sophisticated. With
digital services provided by Singapore's government agencies collectively
receiving millions of unique visits every day, there is a need to safeguard
our users from potential risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like maintaining security in the physical world, ensuring cybersecurity
requires the vigilance of everyone. That is why we have rolled out the
Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP), an evergreen crowdsourcing platform
that encourages the responsible reporting of suspected vulnerabilities
or weaknesses in IT services, systems, resources and processes that may
cripple the government's internet-accessible applications.</p>
<p>With VDP, you can play your role in upholding security in the digital
world. Best of all, if you report a vulnerability that's later validated
by our officers, you'll be rewarded with reputation points on <a href="https://hackerone.com/govtech-vdp?type=team" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HackerOne</a><strong>, a bug bounty platform</strong>!
Earn reputation points to enjoy privileges such as invitations to private
bug bounty programmes.</p>
