<h3>What is Build for Good?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.build.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Build for Good</a>&nbsp;is an initiative
led by&nbsp;<a href="https://open.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Open Government Products (OGP)</a>&nbsp;and
is focused on encouraging citizens to strive to make positive changes in
Singapore.</p>
<p>The goal is to create an environment where individuals feel empowered
and motivated to make meaningful contributions to society, no matter how
small that contribution may seem. It's a platform for people to come together
and build for the greater good.</p>
<p>Citizens can participate by joining the Build for Good hackathon, accelerator
program (available for winning hackathon teams), or community.</p>

teams select a public issue to tackle, brainstorm solutions, create prototypes,
and test them with users.</p>
<p>Throughout this journey, teams receive support in the form of domain expertise,
mentorship, workshops, and resources.</p>
