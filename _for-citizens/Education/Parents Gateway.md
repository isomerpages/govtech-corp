<p>In a bid to strengthen school-home partnerships and help parents become
more aware of their children's day-to-day schooling activities, GovTech
collaborated with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to create the Parents
Gateway. Launched in 2019, this app allows parents to receive general announcements
from their children's schools, updates on upcoming programmes and provide
consent for activity participation.</p>
