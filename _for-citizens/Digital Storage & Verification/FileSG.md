<p>From time to time, government agencies will send official documents to
you. In an effort to make file distribution and management fuss-free, GovTech
created FileSG, a one-stop digital document management platform. With it,
you can easily receive and retrieve government-issued documents, and even
verify their authenticity by checking the validity of the OpenAttestation
files.</p>
