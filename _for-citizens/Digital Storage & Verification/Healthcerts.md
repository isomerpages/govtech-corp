<h3>What is HealthCerts?</h3>
<p>As a COVID-19 response, HealthCerts was a globally inter-operable standard
for Pre-Departure Test results and vaccination certificates to facilitate
the safe resumption of travel.</p>
<p>Powered by Notarise, a platform that supports the authentication and endorsement
process within the government.</p>
<p>The digitally authenticated and endorsed certificates are designed to
be easily shared and provide added assurance to the traveller as well as
authorities.</p>
<h3>Why use HealthCerts?</h3>
<p>As certificates (whether paper or digital form) could be susceptible to
forgery, HealthCerts is tamper-proof, secure (i.e. prevents unauthorised
access) and can be digitally stored/transmitted for greater convenience.</p>
