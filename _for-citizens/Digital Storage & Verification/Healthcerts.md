<p>Introduced as a COVID-19 measure to facilitate the safe resumption of
cross-border travel, HealthCerts is a set of open-source digital standards
and schema used for issuing Pre-Departure Test results and vaccination
certificates.</p>
<p>Being in line with international standards and the Singapore government’s
requirements, these digitally authenticated and endorsed travel health
documents are recognised by both local and overseas authorities. Hence,
for travellers like you, they are an added form of assurance for a hiccup-free
clearance procedure.</p>
<h3>Why use HealthCerts?</h3>
<p>In recent years, forged paper and digital certificates have become more
prevalent. Powered by Notαrise, a platform that supports authentication
and endorsement, HealthCerts is tamper-proof. It is also secure and prevents
unauthorised access. Furthermore, HealthCerts can be digitally stored or
transmitted for an easy verification process by government officials.</p>
