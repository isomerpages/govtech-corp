<p>Introduced as a COVID-19 measure to facilitate the safe resumption of
cross-border travel, HealthCerts is a set of open-source digital standards
and schema used for issuing Pre-Departure Test results and vaccination
certificates. Being in line with international standards and the Singapore
governmentâ€™s requirements, these digitally authenticated and endorsed travel
health documents are recognised by both local and overseas authorities.
Hence, for travellers like you, they are an added form of assurance for
a hiccup-free clearance procedure.</p>
<h3>Why use HealthCerts?</h3>
<p>As certificates (whether paper or digital form) could be susceptible to
forgery, HealthCerts is tamper-proof, secure (i.e. prevents unauthorised
access) and can be digitally stored/transmitted for greater convenience.</p>
