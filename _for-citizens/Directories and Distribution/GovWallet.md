<h3>Making the disbursement of government payouts efficient and secure with GovWallet</h3>
<p>Government agencies disbursing credits and monies have traditionally turned
to paper vouchers or cheques disseminated through the mail, which slows
down the delivery process</p>
<p>As more citizens onboard government apps and use them in daily activities,
it became possible to introduce a wallet feature that allows payouts and
vouchers to be credited to their accounts for quicker and more secure delivery.
GovWallet is GovTech's innovative solution to that.</p>
<p>GovWallet is a digital wallet module that is integrated into key Government
apps such as SingPass, and LifeSG. It facilitates the disbursement of payouts
and credits and allows citizens to directly spend the credits at merchants
with PayNow and NETS e-payment methods.</p>
<p>GovWallet is now integrated into LifeSG, SingPass, Healthy365 app and
services around 1.3M users.</p>
<p>To expand the merchant ecosystem to which these credits can be used, GovWallet
has integrated into the Paynow payment ecosystem of 164,000 merchants and
the NETS payment ecosystem of 43,000 merchants today.</p>
