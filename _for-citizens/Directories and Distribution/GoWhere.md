<p>One thing the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us is that during times of
emergency, the efficient dissemination of information is pivotal to providing
assurance to the public and maintaining stability. A ground-up initiative,
GoWhere was designed to be a reliable source of information for citizens
and businesses to keep up with the latest COVID-19 guidelines and measures.
Capable of answering location-based queries, its suite of platforms, from
ARTGoWhere to MaskGoWhere, supported nationwide distribution efforts by
directing a user to a list of centres within the radius of the postal code
he had entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the free-to-use GoWhere Suite exists as a mini-stack, and has become
a repository of distribution and awareness campaigns in Singapore. SupportGoWhere,
for example, directs Singaporeans in need to over 23 government agencies
that distribute social services, grants and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also useful features for daily activities such as BudgetGoWhere,
which crowdsources public recommendations on budget meals in coffee shops.
The latest site in the GoWhere Suite is<a href="https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/sgready/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>SGReadyGoWhere</u></a>,
a directory where users can search for the locations of Civil Defence Shelters
that are participating in Exercise SG Ready.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of June 2023, the entire GoWhere Suite has seen more than 49 million
visits.</p>
