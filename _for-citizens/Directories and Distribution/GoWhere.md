<p>In times of emergencies, efficient and effective ways of disseminating
information and resources are critical to ensure the successful delivery
of social services and support</p>
<p>GoWhere is a suite of directories initially created in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic and addresses the need for a rapid and reliable source
of information.</p>
<p>Today, the suite has expanded to directories that are useful for day-to-day
such as BudgetGoWhere and SupportGoWhere</p>
<p>The GoWhere suite of websites has received 49M total visits (as of June
2023) and has evolved into the primary channel for more than 23 government
agencies with a need to distribute social services and resources</p>
<p>The latest site in the GoWhere suite is <a href="https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/sgready/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SGReadyGoWhere</a>, a directory
supporting Exercise SG Ready as part of Total Defence Day in 2024, identifying
the locations where the exercise will be taking place.</p>
