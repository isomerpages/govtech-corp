<p>GoWhere is a government platform that provides information and resources

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic taught us that sharing information quickly and effectively
during emergencies is vital to reassure the public and keep things stable.
GoWhere was designed as a ground-up initiative to provide the public and
businesses with the latest and most accurate COVID-19 guidelines. Within
the GoWhere Suite, which included ARTGoWhere to MaskGoWhere, the websites
efficiently supported nationwide distribution efforts by directing the
public to nearby centres based on their postal code.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, the GoWhere Suite exists as a technology stack that has become
a repository of distribution and awareness campaigns in Singapore. SupportGoWhere,
for example, directs Singaporeans in need to over 23 government agencies
that distribute social services, grants and resources.</p>
<p>There are GoWhere sites for daily activities such as BudgetGoWhere, which
provides awareness on budget meal coffee shop locations and includes a
crowdsourcing element allowing the public to contribute findings.</p>
<p>As of March 2024, the entire GoWhere Suite has seen 28 Government initiatives
and more than 61 million visits.</p>
