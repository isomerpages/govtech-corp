<h3>About Tech Kaki</h3>
<p>Citizens are at the heart of our work. Since 2016, a community of everyday
people has played an active role in the development of our digital products
and services.</p>
<p>Members from our 7,000-strong Tech Kaki community take part in focus group
discussions, government user testing and more to make sure that our products
and services meet the needs of citizens and businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll get first dibs on these digital products and services as one of
us. Read on to explore the potential of your contributions as a Tech Kaki
member.</p>
<h4>A small community with a big impact</h4>
<p>Apps like Singpass and LifeSG would not be what they are without Tech
Kaki. As part of our community, you’ll be involved in government research
to address government feedback and co-create better products and services
for all.</p>

<h4>Protecting citizens on Singpass</h4>
<p>Citizens can now spot fraudulent activity better with a redesigned login
page for Singpass, thanks to Tech Kaki. They took part in a user research
study which inspired design changes for the app.</p>

<h4>A smoother LifeSG inbox experience</h4>

applications more easily. This was done by engaging over 100 Tech Kaki
members, who shared their views and needs around the app.</p>
