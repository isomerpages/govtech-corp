<p>Citizens are at the heart of our work. Since 2016, a community of everyday
people has played an active role in the development of our digital products
and services.</p>
<p>Members from our 6,000-strong Tech Kaki community take part in focus group
discussions, user testing, surveys and more to ensure that our products
and services meet the needs of citizens and businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Tech Kaki community member, you‚Äôll get first dibs on various government
digital products and services before they launch. Read on to explore the
potential of your contributions as a Tech Kaki member.</p>
<h3>A small community with a big impact</h3>

Kaki. As part of our community, you‚Äôll be involved in government research
to address government feedback and co-create better products and services
for all.</p>
