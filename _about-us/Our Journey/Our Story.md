<h4>A new chapter in our digital government journey</h4>

<h3>How GovTech was launched in Singapore</h3>
<p>GovTech was formed to spearhead the creation of government digital services
for citizens, businesses and public officers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our story began in late 2016 after the former Infocomm Development Authority
(IDA) merged with the Media Development Authority (MDA) to form today's
Infocomm and Media Development Authority (IMDA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) was then created to take on
the Smart Nation engineering efforts from the former IDA.</p>

<h3>Building our organisation’s capabilities</h3>
<p>Upon our launch in 2016, we established 5 capability centres to strengthen
the public sector's engineering expertise and build the government's capabilities
in emerging technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence, Government Digital
Services (for Application Design, Development and Deployment), Cybersecurity,
Sensors &amp; IoT, and Government ICT Infrastructure. Many of our products
and services tap on the expertise of more than 1 capability centre.</p>

<h3>The creation of the Singapore Government Tech Stack</h3>
<p>The Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) was a significant project by
GovTech that drove the Smart Nation initiative forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was created to offer the Whole of Government (WOG) a better, smarter
and faster way of building and implementing digital government services.</p>
<p>This includes a more seamless and connected experience, easier exchange
of data, and faster deployment of solutions without the need to build infrastructures
from scratch.</p>

<h3>How GovTech maintains a world-class digital government</h3>
<p>It’s important for us to stay on top of the latest digital standards and
practices. Not only do we learn from our local tech experts. We also go
beyond Singapore’s borders to learn from the global community through
<a href="/products-and-services/collaborate-with-us/international-collaboration/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">international collaborations</a>.</p>
<p>One key initiative is the Digital Government Exchange (DGX), an annual
global gathering of Government Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and public
sector leaders from digital governments and smart cities from all over
the world.</p>
<h3>GovTech as a tech powerhouse today</h3>
<p>Our success as the lead agency driving Singapore's Smart Nation initiative
can be defined by the myriad of government digital products and services
that we’ve developed to serve citizens, businesses and public officers
such as Singpass, GoBusiness, Analytics.gov and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together with other government agencies, we have championed innovation
and encouraged digital transformation within the government through services
like HealthCerts with the Ministry of Health and Student Learning Space
with the Ministry of Education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the development of products and services, we have attracted a large
pool of tech talent that include software engineers, data scientists, DevOps
engineers, UX/UI designers and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the go-to organisation for all-things-tech, GovTech also has strong
ties to the local citizens and tech community, through its communities
like <a href="/get-involved/join-our-communities/tech-kaki/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tech Kaki</a>,
<a href="/get-involved/join-our-communities/stack-community/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STACK</a>and <a href="/get-involved/join-our-communities/govtech-reconnect/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GovTech REConnect</a>.</p>
