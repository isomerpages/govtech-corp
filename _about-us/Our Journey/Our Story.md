<h3>How GovTech was launched in Singapore</h3>
<p>GovTech was formed to spearhead the creation of government digital services
for citizens, businesses and public officers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our story began in late 2016 after the former Infocomm Development Authority
(IDA) merged with the Media Development Authority (MDA) to form today's
Infocomm and Media Development Authority (IMDA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) was then created to take on
the Smart Nation engineering efforts from the former IDA.</p>

<h3>Building our organisation’s capabilities</h3>
<p>Upon our launch in 2016, we established 5 capability centres to strengthen
the public sector's engineering expertise and build the government's capabilities
in emerging technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence, Government Digital
Services (for Application Design, Development and Deployment), Cybersecurity,
Sensors &amp; IoT, and Government ICT Infrastructure. Many of our products
and services tap on the expertise of more than 1 capability centre.</p>

<h3>The creation of the Singapore Government Tech Stack</h3>
<p>The Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) was a significant project by
GovTech that drove the Smart Nation initiative forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was created to offer the Whole of Government (WOG) a better, smarter
and faster way of building and implementing digital government services.</p>
<p>This includes a more seamless and connected experience, easier exchange
of data, and faster deployment of solutions without the need to build infrastructures
from scratch.</p>

<p>Late 2016: Merge of IDA and MDA, and the creation of GovTech. GovTech
was officially formed on 1st October 2016.</p>
<p>2017: The Singapore Government announced that GovTech, the Smart Nation
Programme Office and relevant departments from the Ministry of Finance
and Ministry of Communications and Information will come together to form
the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG). Products like Student
Learning Space, ParkingSG and MySkillsFuture were some of the first launched
in GovTech's first year of operation.</p>
<p>2018: The Digital Government Blueprint 1.0 was released, setting out a
vision of a Singapore Government that is digital to the core and serves
with heart. The Singapore Government Tech Stack was developed, forming
the digital backbone of all digital services provided by the government.
The Singpass app and the National Digital Identity (NDI) Platform were
also launched - a crucial part of Singaporeans' everyday lives today. The
first-ever STACK tech conference was held.</p>
<p>2021: The start of DGX - an annual global gathering of Government Chief
Information Officers (CIOs) and public sector leaders from digital governments
and smart cities from all over the world to share knowledge.</p>
<h3>The start of the Digital Government Journey and launch of GovTech</h3>
<p>Singapore began its Digital Government Journey with the Infocomm Development
Authority (IDA), which was focused on regulatory efforts, the development
of the infocomm tech industry in Singapore and Smart Nation engineering
efforts.</p>
<p>In late 2016, the regulatory functions from the IDA were merged with the
Media Development Authority (MDA) to form today's Infocomm and Media Development
Authority (IMDA) due to the blurring lines between the two. The creation
of IMDA results in an organisation that not only oversees the regulatory
framework for telcos and traditional and new media businesses, but also
deliver innovative digital services to the public and oversee personal
data protection regulation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) was created,
to take on the Smart Nation engineering efforts from the former IDA. GovTech
was not only meant to spearhead the delivery of the Government's digital
services for citizens, businesses and public officers, but also put in
place the necessary public infrastructure for the Smart Nation initiative,
such as the deployment of sensors and backend data anlytics support. Additionally,
the organisation was to encourage citizen participation in co-developing
technologies that could benefit the public by building platforms that facilitate
cooperation between citizens and businesses through crowd-sourcing. (Content

<h3>The growth of GovTech - building the organisation's capabilities</h3>
<p>Upon its official launch in 2016, GovTech began its evolutionary journey
with the establishment of 5 Capability Centres to strengthen the public
sector's engineering expertise, as well as to build the government's capabilities
in emerging technologies.</p>
<p>The 5 Capability Centres established were:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government Digital Services (for Application Design, Development &amp;
Deployment)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cybersecurity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensors &amp; IoT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government ICT Infrastructure</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These formed the range of expertise and specialisations that GovTech offers,
with many projects, products and services involving and tapping on the
expertise of more than 1 capability centre.</p>

<h3>Building the foundations of a Smart Nation - the Singapore Government Tech Stack</h3>
<p>As part of the building blocks of the Smart Nation initiative, one Strategic
National Project was key in taking this movement forward - the Singapore
Government Tech Stack (SGTS)</p>
<p>The Government faced the challenge of having multiple legacy systems that
were built in a monolithic nature, causing fragmentations in government
services and processes. The aim was then to move away from building systems
over and over again, and instead focus on reusability and efficiency.</p>
<p>The SGTS was then created by GovTech to offer the Whole of Government
(WOG) a better, smart and faster way for building and implementing digital
government services. This includes a more seamless and connected experience
across government services, easier exchange of data across the government
for policy and solution development, and faster deployment of such solutions
without the need to build infrastructures from scratch.</p>

<h3>Continuously paving the way forward through knowledge sharing</h3>
<p>To keep up with the latest digital standards and practices, GovTech not
only learns from local tech communities, but goes beyond the borders to
learn from the international community as well.</p>
<p>One key initiative is the <strong>Digital Government Exchange (DGX):</strong>
</p>
<p>An annual global gathering of Government Chief Information Officers (CIOs)
and public sector leaders from digital governments and smart cities from
all over the world. Including countries like Australia, Canada, China,
France, the United Kingdom, the United States and more, DGX brings together
a community of like-minded leaders who engage in information exchange,
sharing of experiences and mutual learning, while providing a platform
to explore future collaboration opportunities.</p>

<h3>GovTech today</h3>
<p>Today, GovTech is a culmination of its growth, progress and learnings
over the years since its launch in 2016. As the lead agency driving Singapore's
Smart Nation initiative, GovTech has developed a myriad of government digital
products and services to date that serve citizens, businesses and public
officers</p>
<p>These include the likes of Singpass, GoBusiness, Analytics gov and more.
- GovTech has also successfully collaborated with other government agencies
to champion innovation and encourage digital transformation within the
government, such as HealthCerts with MOH and Student Learning Space with
MOE.</p>
<p>Beyond the development of products and services, GovTech is a tech powerhouse
with a large pool of tech talent that include software engineers, data
scientists, DevOps engineers, UX/UI designers and more. As the go-to organisation
for all-things-tech, GovTech also has strong ties to the local citizens
and tech community, through its communities like <a href="/get-involved/join-our-communities/tech-kaki/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tech Kaki</a>, <a href="/get-involved/join-our-communities/stack-community/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STACK</a> and
<a href="/get-involved/join-our-communities/govtech-reconnect/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GovTech REConnect</a>.</p>
