Since the arrival of the first personal computer in the 1980s, Singapore has embraced technology as a crucial engine of the economy and society. The early computerisation efforts of the government in the 1980s paved the way to becoming one of the world’s most connected countries today.

In the 1990s, Singapore was among the first to have broadband links nationwide, while the 2000s saw the deployment of a fibre broadband network and wireless hotspots throughout the island. Over the years, Singapore has been awarded top marks in prestigious studies such as the World Economic Forum’s Global Information Report.

The country’s infrastructure as well as government digital services are often recognised for its technological readiness. As Singapore continues to leverage on new technologies to digitally transform government digital services, there are lessons to share and much to learn from other countries that have developed new ways of improving the online experience for citizens. We share some of the notable awards and significant milestones that Singapore has garnered over the years.
