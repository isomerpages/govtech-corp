### Digital Government Blueprint
Digitalisation is a key pillar of the Government’s public service transformation efforts. The Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) is a statement of the Government’s ambition to better leverage data and harness new technologies, and to drive broader efforts to build a digital economy and digital society, in support of Smart Nation.

Two years after the launch of the DGB, the Government has introduced new policies and initiatives. COVID-19 has also reaffirmed our emphasis on capability building, and compelled different parts of the Government to accelerate the use of data and of technology to offer digital services that minimise physical contact, and to use technology and digital tools to keep us safe. This has been updated to accurately reflect the current plans and to push for more ambitious goals.

Based on the DGB, GovTech plans to achieve the following goals by 2023:
