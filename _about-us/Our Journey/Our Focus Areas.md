<p>As GovTech continues on its journey to empower our nation with possibilities
through Infocomm and engineering technology, our organisation has set goals
in the upcoming years to achieve goals not only in the area of Digital
Transformation, but also in important aspects like Sustainability, Diversity
and Inclusion, and Social Responsibility.</p>
<h3>Continued Efforts to Build a Digital Government</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>As we continue building Singapore's Digital Government as part of the
Smart Nation Initiative, GovTech's focus areas are outlined by the 5 thrusts
as identified by DGB 2.0.</p>
<p>This includes ensuring government services are easy to access and use
for Singaporeans, improving the workplace experience for public officers,
uplifting digital capabilities to enable bolder transformation, strengthening
enablers for agencies to leverage digital technology and maximising the
use of our available resources.</p>

<p>As the ICT&amp;SS public sector leader, GovTech aims to drive sustainable
digitalisation practices and outcomes for the public sector to support
the Singapore Green Plan 2030 goals and achieve net zero emission by 2045.
To achieve this, we are striving to adopt sustainability as a core principle
in our digitalisation business and professional way of life.</p>
<p>As part of our Sustainability Framework, GovTech is focusing on 3 key
pillars:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>GovTech has also taken active steps to educate on sustainability themes,
such as through GovTech Green Week in 2023. At the 5-day event, GovTechies
had the opportunity to learn more about sustainability in support of the
Go Green SG movement and took part in a variety of activities that promote
environmental sustainability, while learning how they can contribute to
driving sustainable digitalisation for the public sector and a more sustainable
future for Singapore.</p>

<h3>Building Tech for Everyone through Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
<p>When planning out digital government services, our GovTech teams go beyond
the usual product brief with the idea of “Designing for the 100%” to consider
accessibility use cases for digital inclusion. As more services become
digital, by ensuring accessibility wider than the majority, we will be
able to provide better user experiences for everyone. This is exemplified
through many GovTech products having strong accessibility features, such
as enabling high contrast for legibility challenges on Singpass and the
inclusion of VoiceOver and Voice Control features for the visually and/or
physically handicapped on the SafeEntry app.</p>
<p>With that, GovTech is also committed to developing tech that empowers
vulnerable communities.</p>
<h4><u>Digital4Good</u> </h4>
<p>This programme was established to empower underprivileged children/youths
and seniors by increasing their digital literacy. This is achieved by inculcating
skillsets such as programming, problem solving and critical thinking for
children/youth and the use of digital tools for seniors. We started D4G
in 2019 to encourage GovTechies to leverage their tech capabilities to
do good for the community while doing something fun outside of work. The
programme promotes the digital inclusion of underprivileged children, from
ages 7 to 12, and seeks to spark their interest in technology while provisioning
them with digital literacy skills.</p>

</p>
<h4><u>A11y Team (Accessibility Enabling Team)</u></h4>
<p>This accessibility-focused team was formed to understand and design inclusive
government services based on the unique perspectives and usage patterns
of persons with disabilities (PwDs) and seniors. The team complements agile
development methods and promotes the use of automated accessibility testing
in the product development process. This is achieved through the provision
of consultancy services, training sessions, distribution of guides and
playbooks, and outreach activities.</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to promote accessibility, the team organises A11y
Week - an annual learning festival for all public officers in Singapore.
The week-long event aims to foster an understanding and appreciation of
accessible and inclusive design in digital services. In 2023, the festival
was themed "Understand &amp; Understood: Making Communication Inclusive
for All" - focusing on the importance of designing and deploying communications
that are accessible for all, including vulnerable communities like Persons
with Disabilities (PwDs).</p>

<h4><u>GovTech x The Purple Parade</u></h4>
<p>As Singapore's vibrant movement for inclusion, The Purple Parade celebrates
all abilities. Our GovTechies came together to paint the town purple, as
we invited our friends at The Purple Parade to our office to share more
about the movement and help to raise funds for the cause.</p>

</p>
<h4><u>Women in (Gov)Tech </u></h4>
<p>Employee Resource Group (ERG) - this was established to develop ground-up
programmes and initiatives to support the attraction, development, and
retention of female talent within and outside of GovTech. This is in alignment
with GovTech’s commitment to the SG Women in Tech Corporate Pledge.</p>
<p>A manifestation of this ERG is our Girls in Tech Summer Mentorship Programme
- a 3-month mentorship programme where participants are given a personal
project to deepen their technical skills, whilst gaining valuable guidance
and insights from experienced tech professionals. Mentees also learn about
how GovTech builds solutions to address citizen and business needs and
have the opportunity to build professional networks and relationships.</p>

<p>4. Contributing to Society through our CSR Efforts</p>
<p>- At GovTech, we recognise our responsibility to the society in Singapore
and the importance of doing a part. Through a variety of events, GovTechies
get opportunities to do just this. One example is the annual Hair for Hope,
for which we recently broke our record in 2023 with a total of $171,307.70
raised - the second-highest amount by a Hair for Hope Satellite Partner
in 2023.</p>

<h3>Digital Government Blueprint</h3>
<p>Digitalisation is a key pillar of the Government’s public service transformation
efforts. The Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) is a statement of the Government’s
ambition to better leverage data and harness new technologies, and to drive
broader efforts to build a digital economy and digital society, in support
of Smart Nation.</p>
<p>Two years after the launch of the DGB, the Government has introduced new
policies and initiatives. COVID-19 has also reaffirmed our emphasis on
capability building, and compelled different parts of the Government to
accelerate the use of data and of technology to offer digital services
that minimise physical contact, and to use technology and digital tools
to keep us safe. This has been updated to accurately reflect the current
plans and to push for more ambitious goals.</p>
<p>Based on the DGB, GovTech plans to achieve the following goals by 2023:</p>
