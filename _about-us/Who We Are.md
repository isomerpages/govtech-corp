and agility that reflects starlings as they shift synchronously to adapt
and respond to the evolving environment. This mirrors our agency's positioning

<p></p>
<h4>1. <strong>Agile</strong>:</h4>
<p>Being prepared to disrupt ourselves, being prepared to think twice, think
in a different way, and really make those changes on time.</p>
<h4>2. <strong>Bold</strong> in adoptive new solutions:</h4>
<p>Especially where technology is involved, which is possibly ahead of the
curve, [or even] possibly ahead of the private sector.</p>
<h4>3. <strong>Collaborative:</strong></h4>
<p>What we want to do in GovTech is to leverage on the resources that are
already available.</p>
