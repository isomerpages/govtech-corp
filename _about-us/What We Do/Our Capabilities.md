<h3>Leading Digital Transformation</h3>
<p>Our five capability centres were established to strengthen the public
sector's engineering expertise and build the government’s capabilities
in emerging technologies.</p>
<p>These enable GovTech to develop and deliver innovative citizen-centric
products and services across the government.</p>
<h3>1. Application Design, Development &amp; Deployment</h3>
<p>(image)</p>
<p>This centre adopts an “outside-in” approach to deliver citizen-centric
government digital services that support public sector digital transformation.
Our in-house team utilises its deep technical expertise in design and software
development methodologies - such as Agile, user experience design, quality
engineering, DevOps and platform as a service - to deliver scalable, resilient,
and reusable digital services which are supported by the Singapore Government
Technology Stack.</p>
<p>Some examples of products and services developed by this centre include
TraceTogether, OpenCerts, GoBusiness Portal and more.</p>

<h3>2. Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>(image)</p>
<p>This capability centre develops a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity
capabilities that detect and respond against cyber threats, as well as
uncover cyber vulnerabilities. This centre also works with various agencies
to implement secure architectures and provide cybersecurity governance
and technical guidance to ensure a safer, more secure Smart Nation.</p>
<p>Some examples of their work include the development of cybersquatting
tool to monitor the web for new websites with similar domain names and
content to those of our agencies, developing a common Government Trust-based
architecture frameowrk and security testing for COVID-19 projects.</p>

<h3>3. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>(image)</p>
<p>This centre uses data science and artificial intelligence (AI) to extract
data-driven insights and build smart platforms that help improve the delivery
of citizen-centric services and ultimately support government policy outcomes.
This centre also leads the charge in helping public agencies transform
by empowering public officers to level up their data skills and working
with agencies to support their data strategies and data infrastructure.</p>
<p>Some examples of products and services developed by this centre include
the incubation of AI tech solutions such as Vigilant Gantry, WOG ‘super’
virtual assistant, VICA</p>

<h3>4. Government ICT Infrastructure</h3>
<p>(image)</p>
<p>This centre develops a centralised Info-Communications Technology (ICT)
infrastructure, consisting of data centres, applications, devices, networks
and other infra that is scaled across government agencies. The centre specialises
in creating agile, secure, resilient and cost-effective infrastructure
that is optimised for government operations and improves the user experience
for public officers. Beyond this foundational ICT architecture, the centre
also provides guidelines and support to government agencies.</p>
<p>Some examples of their work include the development of VPN capacity and
of the next bound of government networks like SD-WAN (Software-defined
Wide Area Network) and Zero Trust Network.</p>

<h3>5. Smart City Technology</h3>
<p>(image)</p>
<p>This centre works on the design and implementation of a government-wide
Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to support a range of Smart City
applications. This infrastructure enables the connectivity of smart objects
such as wearables, sensors, and mobile devices to facilitate data collection
of data and management of large-scale sensor deployments. Formerly known
as Sensors &amp; IoT (SIOT), this centre was renamed and reorganised in
January 2023 to better reflect GovTech’s focus in putting together the
technologies, capabilities, and products to enable Singapore’s Smart City
vision.</p>
<p>Some examples of innovations by this centre include the Punggol Smart
Town, Personal Alert Button for seniors living alone, e-Canvas for Persons
With Disabilities (PWDs) and more.</p>
