##### From delivering digital services to developing Singapore into a Smart Nation, GovTech advocates innovative technology to shape the way business is done in the government.
   

### Leading Digital Transformation

The world has become so fast paced that people don’t want to stand by reading a page of information, they would much rather look at a presentation and understand the message. It has come to a point where images and videos are used more to promote a product or service and this has extended from businesses to our daily routine. We are all in such a hurry that we wave bye instead of saying “goodbye”, show the watch to point to the time and so on. It is a healthy habit considering how we use our hands and motions to indicate what we are up to or capable of. The Government is in the process of crystallising the next phase of Strategic National Project, and will seek views and perspectives from different sources.

### Capability Centres

Our capability centres were established to strengthen Public Sector engineering expertise and build the government’s capabilities in emerging technologies. Together, they will enable GovTech to develop and deliver innovative citizen-centric products and services across the whole-of-government, in collaboration with Ministries and Statutory Boards.
