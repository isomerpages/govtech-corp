<h3>Leading Digital Transformation<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>Our five capability centres were established to strengthen the public
sector's engineering expertise and build the government’s capabilities
in emerging technologies.</p>
<p>These enable GovTech to develop and deliver innovative citizen-centric
products and services across the government.</p>
<h3>Our Capability Centres</h3>
<h4>1. Application Design, Development &amp; Deployment </h4>
<p>This centre adopts an “outside-in” approach to deliver citizen-centric
government digital services that support public sector digital transformation.
Our in-house team utilises its deep technical expertise in design and software
development methodologies - such as Agile, user experience design, quality
engineering, DevOps and platform as a service - to deliver scalable, resilient,
and reusable digital services which are supported by the Singapore Government
Technology Stack.</p>
<p>Some examples of products and services developed by this centre include
TraceTogether, OpenCerts, GoBusiness Portal and more.</p>

- Application Design, Development and Deployment [Hidden-Level Page]).</p>
<h4>2. Cybersecurity<strong> </strong></h4>
<p>- This capability centre develops a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity
capabilities that detect and respond against cyber threats, as well as
uncover cyber vulnerabilities. This centre also works with various agencies
to implement secure architectures and provide cybersecurity governance
and technical guidance to ensure a safer, more secure Smart Nation.</p>
<p>- Some examples of their work include the development of cybersquatting
tool to monitor the web for new websites with similar domain names and
content to those of our agencies, developing a common Government Trust-based
architecture frameowrk and security testing for COVID-19 projects.</p>

- Cybersecurity [Hidden-Level Page]).</p>
<p><u>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</u> - This centre uses data
science and artificial intelligence (AI) to extract data-driven insights
and build smart platforms that help improve the delivery of citizen-centric
services and ultimately support government policy outcomes. This centre
also leads the charge in helping public agencies transform by empowering
public officers to level up their data skills and working with agencies
to support their data strategies and data infrastructure.</p>
<p>- Some examples of products and services developed by this centre include
the incubation of AI tech solutions such as Vigilant Gantry, WOG ‘super’
virtual assistant, VICA</p>
<p>CTA: Learn more <u>here</u> (Link to About Us - What We Do - Our Capabilities
- Data Science and Artificial Intelligence [Hidden-Level Page]).</p>
<p><u>Government ICT Infrastructure</u> - This centre develops a centralised
Info-Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure, consisting of data
centres, applications, devices, networks and other infra that is scaled
across government agencies. The centre specialises in creating agile, secure,
resilient and cost-effective infrastructure that is optimised for government
operations and improves the user experience for public officers. Beyond
this foundational ICT architecture, the centre also provides guidelines
and support to government agencies.</p>
<p>- Some examples of their work include the development of VPN capacity
and of the next bound of government networks like SD-WAN (Software-defined
Wide Area Network) and Zero Trust Network.</p>
<p>CTA: Learn more <u>here</u> (Link to About Us - What We Do - Our Capabilities
- Government ICT infrastructure [Hidden-Level Page]).</p>
<p><u>Smart City Technology</u> - This centre works on the design and implementation
of a government-wide Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to support
a range of Smart City applications. This infrastructure enables the connectivity
of smart objects such as wearables, sensors, and mobile devices to facilitate
data collection of data and management of large-scale sensor deployments.
Formerly known as Sensors &amp; IoT (SIOT), this centre was renamed and
reorganised in January 2023 to better reflect GovTech’s focus in putting
together the technologies, capabilities, and products to enable Singapore’s
Smart City vision.</p>
<p>- Some examples of innovations by this centre include the Punggol Smart
Town, Personal Alert Button for seniors living alone, e-Canvas for Persons
With Disabilities (PWDs) and more.</p>

<h5>From delivering digital services to developing Singapore into a Smart Nation, GovTech advocates innovative technology to shape the way business is done in the government.</h5>
<h3>Leading Digital Transformation</h3>
<p>The world has become so fast paced that people don’t want to stand by
reading a page of information, they would much rather look at a presentation
and understand the message. It has come to a point where images and videos
are used more to promote a product or service and this has extended from
businesses to our daily routine. We are all in such a hurry that we wave
bye instead of saying “goodbye”, show the watch to point to the time and
so on. It is a healthy habit considering how we use our hands and motions
to indicate what we are up to or capable of. The Government is in the process
of crystallising the next phase of Strategic National Project, and will
seek views and perspectives from different sources.</p>

<h3>Capability Centres</h3>
<p>Our capability centres were established to strengthen Public Sector engineering
expertise and build the government’s capabilities in emerging technologies.
Together, they will enable GovTech to develop and deliver innovative citizen-centric
products and services across the whole-of-government, in collaboration
with Ministries and Statutory Boards.</p>
