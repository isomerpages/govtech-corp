<h2>Advancing how we live, work and play through tech</h2>
<p>Our vision is to create a government that is "Digital to the Core, and
Serves with Heart". We achieve this by using technology to create services
that are easy, seamless and secure for people to use, and placing the needs
of citizens and businesses at the centre of everything we do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a digital government, our public officers are also able to continually
upskill, adapt to new challenges and work more effectively across agencies
as well as with citizens and businesses in Singapore.</p>
<p>Our nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a great manifestation
of our strengths as a digital government. We used data and technology to
offer digital services and tools that kept citizens safe and facilitated
key activities, such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether.</p>

<h3>What's next for our digital government?</h3>
<p>GovTech has its eyes set on harnessing new technologies and leveraging
on data, as part of the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) 2.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the launch of the first DGB in 2018, we have successfully digitalised
government services and achieved high citizen and business satisfaction
through products like Singpass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With DGB 2.0, GovTech will drive even more digital government transformation
to support the Smart Nation initiative.</p>
