<h3>Building a Digital Government through Digital Transformation </h3>
<p>As we transform Singapore through technology, digital government transformation
is all about enabling significant improvements in how we live, work and
play as a nation as part of the Smart Nation initiative.</p>
<p>The vision is to create a Government that is "Digital to the Core, and
Serves with Heart" - a Digital Government that is able to build stakeholder-centric
services that cater to the needs of citizens and businesses. Transacting
with our Digital Government should be made easy, seamless and secure. Internally,
public officers should also be able to continually upskill, adapt to new
challenges and work more effectively across agencies as well as with citizens
and businesses in Singapore.</p>
<p>A manifestation of this, as an example, was the nation's response to the
COVID-19 pandemic as the government accelerated the use of data and technology
to offer digital services and tools that keep citizens safe and facilitated
key activities, such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether.</p>

<h3>Supporting the Smart Nation initiative by harnessing new technologies </h3>
<p>With the first DGB, we have successfully digitalised Government services
and achieved high citizen and business satisfaction through products like
Singpass. These efforts were not only key to Singapore's rapid digital
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but have also supported the nation's
global standing as a leading Digital Government.</p>
<h4>The new DGB 2.0: </h4>
<p>As of 2023, DGB 2.0 has been released as a refresh on the objectives and
strategies to pave the way forward for our Digital Government. This statement
by the Government guides us and the work we do at GovTech, as we continuously
aim to leverage on data and harness technology to support the Smart Nation
initiative. - New infographic to summarise the 5 thrusts identified in
DGB 2.0 and what each means (info from <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-blueprint/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RZBLw_19hI4WPRpbZfXIiqpsq3WGMN78/view</u></a> )</p>
<p>Thrust 1: Ensure that all Singaporeans can trust Government services and
find them easy to access and use Thrust 2: Significantly improve the workplace
experience of public officers Thrust 3: Uplift digital capabilities and
competencies to enable deeper and bolder transformation Thrust 4: Strengthen
enablers for agencies to fully leverage digital technology to enable deeper
and bolder transformation Thrust 5: Maximise use of our available resources</p>
