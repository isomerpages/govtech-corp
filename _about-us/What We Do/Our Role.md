<h3>Advancing how we live, work and play through tech</h3>
<p>Our vision is to create a government that is "Digital to the Core, and
Serves with Heart". We achieve this by using technology to create services
that are easy, seamless and secure for people to use, and placing the needs
of citizens and businesses at the centre of everything we do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a digital government, our public officers are also able to continually
upskill, adapt to new challenges and work more effectively across agencies
as well as with citizens and businesses in Singapore.</p>
<p>Our nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a great manifestation
of our strengths as a digital government. We used data and technology to
offer digital services and tools that kept citizens safe and facilitated
key activities, such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether.</p>

<h3>What's next for our digital government?</h3>
<p>GovTech has its eyes set on harnessing new technologies and leveraging
on data, as part of the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) 2.0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the launch of the first DGB in 2018, we have successfully digitalised
government services and achieved high citizen and business satisfaction
through products like Singpass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With DGB 2.0, Govtech will drive even more digital government transformation
to support the Smart Nation initiative.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Building a Digital Government through Digital Transformation</h3>
<p>As we transform Singapore through technology, digital government transformation
is all about enabling significant improvements in how we live, work and
play as a nation as part of the Smart Nation initiative.</p>
<p>The vision is to create a Government that is "Digital to the Core, and
Serves with Heart" - a Digital Government that is able to build stakeholder-centric
services that cater to the needs of citizens and businesses. Transacting
with our Digital Government should be made easy, seamless and secure. Internally,
public officers should also be able to continually upskill, adapt to new
challenges and work more effectively across agencies as well as with citizens
and businesses in Singapore.</p>
<p>A manifestation of this, as an example, was the nation's response to the
COVID-19 pandemic as the government accelerated the use of data and technology
to offer digital services and tools that keep citizens safe and facilitated
key activities, such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether.</p>
<h3>Supporting the Smart Nation initiative by harnessing new technologies</h3>
<p>With the first DGB, we have successfully digitalised Government services
and achieved high citizen and business satisfaction through products like
Singpass. These efforts were not only key to Singapore's rapid digital
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but have also supported the nation's
global standing as a leading Digital Government.</p>
<h4>The new DGB 2.0:</h4>
<p>As of 2023, DGB 2.0 has been released as a refresh on the objectives and
strategies to pave the way forward for our Digital Government. This statement
by the Government guides us and the work we do at GovTech, as we continuously
aim to leverage on data and harness technology to support the Smart Nation
initiative.</p>
