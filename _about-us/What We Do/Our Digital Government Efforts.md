<p>GovTech drives the digital government transformation across our nation.
Our initiatives focus on creating user-friendly digital products, from
helpful apps to informative websites and robust platforms, designed to
streamline daily experiences of public services and provide robust support
for businesses.</p>
<p>We encourage all citizens and businesses to explore and embrace these
digital government solutions, crafted with your needs in mind.</p>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>As the lead government agency driving Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative
and the digitalisation of public services, GovTech's mission is clear:
to build digital government products – such as intuitive apps, informative
websites, and reliable platforms – that tangibly improve the lives of citizens
and businesses, making Singapore a leading Smart Nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By streamlining processes, government services become more accessible
and convenient for everyone, regardless of location or technical proficiency.
It also empowers businesses with efficient digital interfaces, fostering
a more competitive and dynamic economy. Furthermore, a digitally transformed
government can leverage data and technology to make more informed decisions,
respond effectively to the evolving needs of its population, and ultimately
enhance the overall quality of life for all Singaporeans.</p>
<h3>What We Do: Digitalisation of Public Services</h3>
<p>The Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) plays a vital role in advancing
our digital government efforts. It acts as a strategic roadmap, guiding
the digitalisation of public services and ensuring a cohesive and citizen-centric
approach to our digital government transformation. Through the DGB, we
are streamlining processes, enhancing accessibility, and leveraging technology
to provide better services for everyone.</p>
<h4>Enhancing Digital Government Infrastructure</h4>
<p>We integrate digital technologies into the experience of public services
to bring about significant improvements in efficiency, accessibility, and
overall user experience for our citizens. This digitalisation means simpler
online transactions, faster service delivery, and more convenient access
to essential government resources.</p>
<h4>Advancing Smart City Technologies</h4>
<p>GovTech strategically implements smart city solutions across Singapore,
such as the Open Digital Platform (ODP) in Punggol Digital District (PDD),
our nation's first <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/our-capabilities/smart-city-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>smart city project</u></a>.
This platform enables seamless communication and data exchange between
operations like building management, utilities, and transportation. It
facilitates intelligent automation and optimised resource allocation, creating
a more efficient urban environment.</p>
<h3>What is a Digital Government Blueprint (DGB)?</h3>
<p>The Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) is our comprehensive strategic
plan that outlines the vision, mission, and key objectives for the ongoing
digital government transformation within the public sector. It serves as
a guiding framework for the digitalisation of public services, ensuring
a coordinated and citizen-focused approach to leveraging technology across
all government agencies in Singapore.</p>
<h4>Key Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To make transacting with the government easy, seamless, and secure for
all citizens and businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To empower government agencies through upskilling and fostering collaboration
to drive the digitalisation of public services effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To leverage data and emerging technologies like AI to deliver citizen-centric
digital services and enhance the productivity of government agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To actively engage citizens and businesses in the co-creation of digital
services, ensuring they meet real needs and are user-friendly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide simplified user journeys and a single, convenient point of
access to a wide range of government services online.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These objectives are intrinsically linked to our <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/our-enhanced-smart-nation-vision-paving-the-way-for-a-new-digital-era/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Smart Nation initiatives</u></a>,
working towards building a thriving digital economy and delivering tangible
benefits to our target audience – citizens and businesses across Singapore.</p>
<h3>Turning the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) into a reality<br></h3>
<p>Realising the ambitious goals of the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB)
requires a collaborative effort involving businesses and ICT vendors. These
collective endeavours are crucial in harnessing new technologies, better
leveraging data insights, and driving the broader efforts to build a truly
digital economy and society within Singapore.</p>
<p>These efforts, all supporting the overarching Smart Nation vision, are
classified into the following key areas:
