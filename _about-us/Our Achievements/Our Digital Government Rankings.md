The assessment measures the e-government performance of countries relative to each other, and recognises that each country should decide upon the level and extent of its e-government initiatives in keeping with its own national development priorities.

In 2022, Singapore ranked 12th in the world. Denmark and Finland were the top two leading countries in e-government development.
