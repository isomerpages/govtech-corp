The [Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-identity/sgfindex/overview.html) has won the Most Innovative Use of Data for Digital Transformation award at the [INSPIRE Tech Awards 2021](https://cioacademyasia.org/inspire-tech-awards-2021/). By winning this award, Singapore illustrates the importance, possibilities and impact of public-private sector collaborations, consent-based data-driven innovations and trusted online systems.

_“SGFinDex exemplifies the close collaboration between public and private sectors through the use of digital technology to enhance the financial well-being of Singaporeans. Through SGFinDex, individuals can have greater clarity of their financial health and plan their finances holistically.”_

_**Damien Pang, Deputy Chief FinTech Officer and Executive Director for Data & Technology Architecture, Monetary Authority of Singapore**_

[SGFinDex](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-identity/sgfindex/overview.html) is a joint initiative by the [Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)](https://www.mas.gov.sg/development/fintech/sgfindex) and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) in collaboration with [The Association of Banks in Singapore](https://abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/sgfindex) and seven participating banks. It is the world’s first public digital infrastructure to utilise a National Digital Identity (Singpass) and a centrally managed online consent system to enable individuals to access their financial data held across different government agencies and financial institutions.
