<p>More than a third of your day is spent in cyberspace – be it at work or
play. But how much do you know about the security of that space, and how
safe are you online? Let Jaga tell you more!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Who is Jaga?</h3>
<p>Jaga, which means ‘guard’ in Malay, is a hedgehog who joined GovTech as
a cybersecurity engineer in 2017. Most times, he is cute, gentle and non-aggressive.
But don’t be fooled by his demeanour! Jaga is a fierce and passionate protector
of Singapore’s government digital systems. When he feels threatened by
cybercriminals, his spines (some of which look like mouse cursors) pop
up in self-defence immediately and spiking any cyber threats in the vicinity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are grateful to Jaga for keeping our cyberspace safe but we s<u>t</u>ill<u> </u>must
be able to defend ourselves. In cyberspace, cybercriminals could be lying
in wait for us even where we think we are safest. By staying alert, taking
preventive measures, and reporting with a click to protect ourselves when
we detect a cyber threat, we can ensure that we remain cyber-safe!</p>

<h3><strong>Jaga’s your friend; help him defend the Jaga-verse! </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Through the years, Jaga has levelled up as a cybersecurity engineer. He
is ever vigilant when it comes to emerging and increasingly sophisticated
threats, and tries his best to stay up-to-date on every cyber threat released.
But despite Jaga’s best efforts, there are times when there are just too
many cyber threats popping up for one hedgehog to deal with. That’s why
it’s important to remember that cybersecurity is our shared responsibility,
and everyone has a role to play in protecting cyberspace. Cyber threats
may be hidden from view, but they are always waiting for you! &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here are two of the cyber villains that he has encountered recently:</strong>
