### **Background**

The e-Government Customer Perception Survey is conducted annually by the Ministry of Finance and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) to assess the level of receptivity towards key e-government initiatives used; and to identify areas for further improvement on the electronic services (e-services) used by the general public.

The survey was conducted from June to July 2016 for the reporting period of FY2015 (i.e. 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016).

### **Objective**

The survey aims to determine the level of satisfaction in using Government websites and e-services and identify area for improvement.

More than 90% of the respondents who visited Government websites were satisfied (rating of 4 and above – out of a scale of 6) with the usefulness and the ease of finding & understanding the information provided on the websites.

8 out of 10 (83%) respondents, who have visited Government websites, have transacted with the Government online using e-services in the past 12 months of the financial year.
