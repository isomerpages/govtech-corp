<p>The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) is the public sector lead that
safeguards the Singapore Government’s Infocomm Technology and Smart Systems
(ICT &amp; SS) and enables Singapore to be a safe and secure Smart Nation.
As part of the Government’s ongoing efforts to strengthen the security
posture of our ICT systems and digital services used by citizens, businesses
and public sector employees, GovTech works closely with the global cybersecurity
researcher community and members of the public to augment the government’s
cybersecurity capabilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GovTech runs three crowdsourced vulnerability discovery programmes:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Vulnerability Rewards Programme (VRP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government Bug Bounty Programme (GBBP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3>Vulnerability Rewards Programme </h3>
<p>The Vulnerability Rewards Programme (VRP) is a new crowdsourced programme
that rewards ‘white hat’ hackers who discover vulnerabilities in critical
government systems. The programme will first start with three systems:
Singpass and Corppass (GovTech); Member eServices (Ministry of Manpower
– Central Provident Fund Board); and Workpass Integrated System 2 (Ministry
of Manpower). More systems will be progressively added to the programme.
Rewards can range from US$250 to US$5,000 depending on the severity of
the discovered vulnerabilities. A special bounty of up to US$150,000 is
offered for critical vulnerabilities that could cause exceptional impact
on selected systems and data, highlighting the Singapore government’s commitment
to secure critical government systems and valuable personal data. The special
bounty was benchmarked against crowdsourced vulnerability disclosure programmes
from leading technology companies.</p>

<h3>Government Bug Bounty Programme </h3>
<p>Launched in Dec 2018, the Government Bug Bounty Programme (GBBP) is a
seasonal programme that invites highly-skilled ‘white hat’ hackers – or
ethical hackers – to conduct in-depth testing of selected systems to discover
vulnerabilities in ICT systems. Bounties are paid for valid vulnerabilities
depending on the severity of the discovered ‘bug’, and the discovered ‘bug’
will subsequently be reported to the respective agency for remediation.
As of August 2021, there have been four iterations of the programme, covering
a total of 33 systems. Each iteration ran for a period of two to three
weeks and involved five to 10 selected systems. The selected systems comprised
Critical and other high-profile systems that have high user touchpoint.
More than 1,000 local and international ‘white hat’ hackers have participated
in the four GBBP iterations. In total, over 100 valid vulnerabilities have
been reported and promptly remediated, with more than US$100,000 paid out
to the participants. GovTech will continue to conduct the GBBP several
times a year, signaling the Government’s continued commitment to work with
the global cybersecurity community and industry to strengthen and safeguard
government ICT systems and digital services.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Vulnerability Disclosure Programme </h3>
<p>The Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP), launched in October 2019,
invites members of public to report vulnerabilities found in any Government
Internet-facing web-based and mobile applications. Validated vulnerabilities
under the VDP will be rewarded with HackerOne reputation points The VDP
serves as an evergreen crowdsourcing platform to encourage responsible
reporting of any suspected vulnerability, while strengthening the public’s
sense of collective ownership over the cybersecurity of Government systems.
As of March 2021, over 900 vulnerabilities from 59 agencies have been reported;
more than 400 reports were valid vulnerabilities which were promptly remediated.</p>
<p>Members of the public can report a suspected vulnerability in two ways:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use the vulnerability disclosure link (“Report Vulnerability”) incorporated
into all Government webpages and mobile applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email <a href="mailto:vulnerability_disclosure@tech.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">vulnerability_disclosure@tech.gov.sg</a> with
details of the suspected vulnerability</p>
</li>
</ol>
