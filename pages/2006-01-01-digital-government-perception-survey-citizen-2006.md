### **Background**

The e-Government Customer Perception Survey is conducted annually by the Ministry of Finance and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) to assess the general public's level of receptivity towards e-Government initiatives.

The objectives of the survey are to:

Determine the proportion of population who have transacted with the Government electronically and their satisfaction with Government e-services; and
Determine the proportion of population who have transacted with the Government using non-electronic means (e.g. counter, poster, fax) and their reasons for not using electronic means.
The fourth e-Government Customer Perception Survey was conducted in March 2006 to assess the general public's receptivity towards e-Government initiatives in 2005.

### **Research Methodology**

1,200 respondents, representative of the total demographic population above the age of 15, were surveyed from 13 to 25 Mar 2006. Data collection was done through telephone interviews, administered in English, Chinese and Malay.

### **Survey Results**

**(i) In 2005, 9 out of 10 who transacted with the Government did so electronically at least once in the past 12 months**
Of those who had a need to transact and had transacted with Government in 2005, 9 out of 10 did so electronically (i.e. via internet, kiosk, IVRS, e-mail, SMS, etc) at least once in the past 12 months. This was similar to the 2004 survey results. The remaining 1 out of 10 used non-electronic means such as counter, fax or post to transact with the Government.
