<h3>Centralising file storage for government documents with FileSG.</h3>
<p>As we begin to engage with different government agencies, there is a need
for a centralised place to store and retrieve verified official documents.</p>
<p>Just like how we commonly use cloud drives such as Google Drive, and Dropbox
for our personal use, FileSG is the one-stop portal for citizens to receive
documents from all government agencies.</p>
<p><strong>- Check if there are any stats of usage.</strong>

<h3>Why use FileSG?</h3>
<p>For Citizens, it negates the need to visit different websites or portals
to get one-view access to all their official documents.</p>
<p>It's convenient as Singpass will allow easy access to the storage portal,
and also sends timely reminders whenever new documents are being shared
with us by the different agencies.</p>
<h3>How to use FileSG?</h3>
<p>For citizens with Singpass, simply login to FileSG's website with your
Singpass credentials.</p>
<p>For those without Singpass, you will have to visit FileSG's website and
enter your Transaction ID for the documents you need to retrieve. Once
you've done that, there will be a 2FA authentification to verify your identity
before you can officially retrieve the files.</p>
