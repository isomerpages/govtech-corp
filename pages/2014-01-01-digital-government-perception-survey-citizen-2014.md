The e-Government Customer Perception Survey is conducted annually by the Ministry of Finance and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) to assess the level of receptivity towards key e-government initiatives used; and to identify areas for further improvement on the electronic services (e-services) used by the general public.

The survey was conducted in July 2014 for the reporting period of FY2013 (i.e. 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014).

### **Objective**

The survey aims to determine the level of satisfaction in using Government websites and e-services and identify area for improvement.
