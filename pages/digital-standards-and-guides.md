### **Standards and Guides**

As the Singapore government rolls out more digital services, we need to provide standards and guides to ensure a complete and consistent user experience for users.

##### **Ministry Family Digitalisation Guide**

The Ministry Family Digitalisation Guide helps all Government ministries and agencies formulate their digitalisation plans.

##### **Digital Service Standards**

[Digital Service Standards (DSS)](/digital-service-standards/){:target="_blank"} is a set of standards for agencies to implement their digital services to meet the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) goal of delivering digital services that are easy, seamless and relevant for our citizens and businesses.

All public facing digital services of the Government must meet the DSS.  In addition, the Government conducts mystery-shopping checks based on the DSS, to ensure that our digital services are implemented consistently to meet the desired outcomes in DGB.
