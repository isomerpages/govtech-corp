<h3><strong>Cybersecurity –&nbsp;whose responsibility?</strong></h3>
<p>In this digital age, you probably spend close to a third of your day in
cyberspace –&nbsp;be it at work or play. But how much do you know about
cybersecurity, and how safe are you online? Let JAGA tell you more!</p>

<h4><strong>Who is JAGA?</strong></h4>
<p>JAGA, which means ‘guard’ in Malay, is a hedgehog who joined GovTech as
a cybersecurity engineer in 2017. Most times, he is cute, gentle and non-aggressive.
And he is also small. This makes him an easy target for cyber criminals
to approach. But what they do not know is that when JAGA feels threatened,
his spines (some of which look like mouse cursors) pop up in self-defence
immediately –&nbsp;hence preventing any cyber threats from actually harming
him.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>In some ways, we are like JAGA. We may think we are ‘small’ and insignificant
in cyberspace, but that does not mean we will not be targeted. That is
why we need to practise good cyber safety too – by staying alert and taking
defensive and preventive measures, like letting our own ‘mouse cursor spines’
pop up whenever we sense a cyber threat,&nbsp;because a click is all it
takes to protect ourselves.</p>
<h4><br><strong>JAGA’s your friend; help him defend!&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Through the years, JAGA has levelled up as a cybersecurity engineer. He
is ever vigilant when it comes to emerging and increasingly sophisticated
threats, and always up-to-date on every cyber threat released (even faster
than antivirus programmes). But despite JAGA’s best efforts, he cannot
do it all on his own, because cyberspace is our shared responsibility,
and everyone has a role to play in keeping it safe. Just remember: Cyber
threats may be hidden from view, but they are always waiting for you!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here are two of the cyber villains that he has encountered recently:</strong>
