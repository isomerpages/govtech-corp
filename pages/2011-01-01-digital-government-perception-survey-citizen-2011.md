### **Background**

The e-Government Customer Perception Survey is conducted annually by the Ministry of Finance and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) to assess the level of receptivity towards e-Government initiatives among the general public; and to identify areas for further improvement.

The survey was conducted in April/ May 2011 for the reporting periods of FY2010 (i.e. 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011).

### **Objectives**

The survey aims to determine the proportion of users who transacted with the Government electronically, either on their own or with help and the level of satisfaction in using Government electronic services.

### **Research Methodology**

1,200 respondents, representative of the total demographic population above the age of 15, were surveyed. Data collection was done via telephone interviews.

### **Survey Results**

**Users who had transacted with the Government electronically, either on their own or with help, at least once in the past 12 months of the Financial Year**

More than 9 out of 10 (93%) who transacted with Government did so electronically (via the Internet, automated kiosks, email, telephone via the Interactive Voice Recognition System, SMS, etc.), either on their own or with help, at least once in the past 12 months of the Financial Year.

The typical profile of such users, whether on their own or with help, was skewed towards young adults (aged 30 to 49 years old) and white collar workers.

The remaining 7% who had never transacted electronically with the Government was primarily senior citizens, blue-collar workers and the non-working group. To help this group of users, the Government has put in place a network of easily accessible CitizenConnect centres. They can go to any CitizenConnect centre for free internet access or complimentary help to transact electronically with the Government. There are currently 27 Citizen Connect centres located throughout Singapore.

**Satisfaction with overall quality of Government electronic services.**

More than 5 out of 10 users (53%) gave a rating of 5 and above on a 6-point scale on their satisfaction with the quality of Government electronic services. 91% of respondents would recommend Government electronic services to others.

If "don't know/ can't say" is excluded, percent satisfied (i.e. 4-6) is 84%.

* Accessibility of the service
* User friendliness
* Ease of completing the transaction
* Speed of transaction
