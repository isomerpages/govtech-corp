### **Background**

The e-Government Perception Survey on Businesses is conducted annually by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) to determine the level of adoption and satisfaction for e-Government initiatives targeted at the business community.

This is the second e-Government Perception Survey on Businesses. It was conducted between 8 February and 20 April 2007 for the reporting period of FY2006.

### **Research Methodology**

1,629 businesses, representative of the Singapore's industry sectors were surveyed. The industries were:

* Commerce,
* Financial & Business Services,
* Manufacturing,
* Community, Social & Personal Services,
* Transportation, Storage & Communications, and
* Construction.

Data collection was done through telephone interviews.

### **Survey Results**

3 out of 4 businesses (76%) obtained information from the Government in the past 12 months.

More than 9 out of 10 businesses (95%) that obtained information from the Government did so electronically (via the Internet, automated kiosks, email, telephone via the Interactive Voice Recognition System, SMS, etc.), at least once in the past 12 months.

More than 7 out of 10 businesses (74%) that had visited the EnterpriseOne website ( www.enterpriseone.gov.sg), were satisfied with the overall quality of the Government information found on the website. The result is similar to the 75% achieved in FY2005.

Of the 6% that did not transact electronically with the Government, whether on their own or with help, almost all were micro-SMEs with no more than 10 employees. The micro-SMEs requested for:

* Free internet access at convenient locations
* Free training on government electronic services
* Someone available to assist

To help the micro-SMEs, the Government has put in place a network of easily accessible CitizenConnect centres. Micro-SMEs can go to any CitizenConnect centre for free internet access and complimentary help to transact electronically with the Government. There are currently 28 CitizenConnect centres throughout Singapore.
