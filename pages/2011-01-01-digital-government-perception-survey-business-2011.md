### **Background**

The e-Government Perception Survey on Businesses is conducted annually by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) to determine the level of adoption and satisfaction for e-Government electronic services targeted at the business community.

The survey was conducted from March to June 2011 for the reporting period of FY2010 (i.e. 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011).

### **Objectives**

The survey aims to determine the frequency of obtaining information and/or performing transactions with the Government and the level of satisfaction with regards to the EnterpriseOne website (www.business.gov.sg) and Government e-Services.

### **Research Methodology**

* Commerce,
* Community, Social & Personal Services,
* Construction,
* Financial & Business Services,
* Manufacturing, and
* Transportation, Storage & Communications.

Data collection was done through telephone interviews.

### **Survey Results**

3 out of 5 businesses (68%) obtained information from the Government in the past 12 months.

More than 9 out of 10 businesses (98%) that obtained information from the Government did so electronically (via the Internet, automated kiosks, email, telephone via the Interactive Voice Recognition System, SMS, etc.), at least once in the past 12 months.
