<h4>Realising the Digital Government Blueprint</h4>
<p>Through our Digital Government Blueprint, we aspire to create a government
that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart.” This means that transacting
with the government will be easy, seamless, and secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also means that public officers will continually upskill and work collaboratively
across agencies to drive digitalisation within the government and offer
better services to citizens and businesses.</p>
<h4>A shared stack for collective progress</h4>
<p>In line with the Digital Government Blueprint, we need to enable a consistent
service standard across the government comprising user-centric services
that are secure.</p>
<p>Thus, a robust development stack that supports modern application development
across the government has been adopted.</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity efforts within the digital government</h3>
<p>The Cybersecurity Group (CSG) leads the efforts to develop the cybersecurity
strategy for the government, secures the usage of government digital services
for the public and protects the Government’s ICT systems and Smart systems
(ICT &amp; SS).</p>
<p>One of the five capability centres at GovTech, the group's suite of cybersecurity
capabilities range from blue-teaming capabilities that detect and respond
against cyber threats, to red-teaming capabilities that uncover cyber vulnerabilities
in Government’s ICT &amp; SS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond developing cyber-defence capabilities, this centre also develops
cybersecurity policies and guidelines for agencies, works with agencies
to implement secure architectures and provides cybersecurity technical
guidance that help build a safer, more secure Smart Nation for our citizens
and businesses.</p>
<p>Learn more about our cybersecurity efforts with these articles below.</p>
