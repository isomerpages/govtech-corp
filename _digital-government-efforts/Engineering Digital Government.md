<h3>The digital transformation of Singapore's public sector</h3>
<h4>Realising the Digital Government Blueprint</h4>
<p>Through our Digital Government Blueprint, we aspire to create a government
that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart.” This means that transacting
with the government will be easy, seamless, and secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also means that public officers will continually upskill and work collaboratively
across agencies to drive digitalisation within the government and offer
better services to citizens and businesses.</p>
<h4><br>A shared stack for collective progress</h4>
<p>In line with the Digital Government Blueprint, we need to enable a consistent
service standard across the government comprising user-centric services
that are secure.</p>
<p>Thus, a robust development stack that supports modern application development
across the government has been adopted.</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity efforts within the digital government</h3>
<p>The Cybersecurity Group (CSG) leads the efforts to develop the cybersecurity
strategy for the government, secures the usage of government digital services
for the public and protects the Government’s ICT systems and Smart systems
(ICT &amp; SS).</p>
<p>One of the five capability centres at GovTech, the group's suite of cybersecurity
capabilities range from blue-teaming capabilities that detect and respond
against cyber threats, to red-teaming capabilities that uncover cyber vulnerabilities
in Government’s ICT &amp; SS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond developing cyber-defence capabilities, this centre also develops
cybersecurity policies and guidelines for agencies, works with agencies
to implement secure architectures and provides cybersecurity technical
guidance that help build a safer, more secure Smart Nation for our citizens
and businesses.</p>
<p>Learn more about our cybersecurity efforts with these articles below.</p>

<h4>Government IT Security Incident Response (GITSIR) Team</h4>
<p>The Government IT Security Incident Response (GITSIR) team enables the
Government to provide a swift response to cybersecurity incidents.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at what the team does:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Perform incident investigations, digital forensics, malware analysis,
etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Act as the primary point of contact for all security incidents co-ordinate
with relevant internal and external parties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>GITSIR proactively publishes alerts, advisories, and directives on security
vulnerabilities and threats. GITSIR regularly keeps agencies up-to-date
on cybersecurity best practices to address the latest and upcoming cyber
threats.</p>
<p>However, incidents may still occur from time to time. Agency users or
IT teams that detect unusual activities or suspected malware must report
their observations to GITSIR. Each Agency has appointed its own team of
Security Incident Response Managers and Officers (SIRMs/SIROs). Together
with the Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) and GITSIR, they work
together to take the necessary steps when faced with possible cybersecurity
threats.</p>
<p>GITSIR uses the Incident Management process to identify the incident’s
root cause and provide recommendations to agencies, who will then contain,
recover and strengthen themselves against future attacks. GITSIR helps
to triage each report to ascertain the severity of each case as well as
coordinate with the parties involved, and advise affected agencies on appropriate
actions. It also carries out forensic and malware analysis and helps the
Government prevent future attacks.</p>
