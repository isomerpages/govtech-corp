<h3>Driving the digital transformation of Singapore's public sector</h3>
<p>Through our Digital Government Blueprint, we aspire to create a government
that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart.”</p>
<p>This means that transacting with the government will be easy, seamless,
and secure.</p>
<p>It also means that public officers will continually upskill and work collaboratively
across agencies to drive digitalisation within the government and offer
better services to citizens and businesses.</p>
<h3>Engineering a Digital Government through a Shared Stack</h3>
<p>In line with the Digital Government Blueprint, we need to enable a consistent
service standard across the Government comprising user-centric services
that do not compromise on security. Thus, a robust development stack that
supports modern application development across the Government has been
adopted.</p>
<h4><u>Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)</u></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Digital Gov Efforts/SGTS_banner_image.jpg">
</div>
<p>The Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) provides all government agencies
with a shared digital infrastructure, services, and tools. It comprises
software and infrastructure components that are scalable, reusable, and
interoperable.</p>
<p>The two layers of the SGTS are the base and services layers, which contain
components that cover the entire app development life cycle.</p>
<p>Through the SGTS, government agencies can develop applications in a better,
smarter, and faster way as they can now tap a ready suite of products and
services to produce services of a high quality and standard.</p>

<h4><u>Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC)</u></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Digital Gov Efforts/GCC_NewHeaderBanner.jpg">
</div>
<p>GCC allows less sensitive government systems and information to be stored
on a cloud computing platform.</p>
<p>It provides agencies with a means of adopting commercial cloud solutions
offered by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google without compromising on cybersecurity.
Currently, more than 600 government systems have migrated to cloud.</p>
<p>By tapping cloud computing platforms, government agencies can circumvent
racking, stacking, and maintaining on-site computing hardware. This gives
development teams more time to focus on software engineering and delivering
digital applications to internal and external stakeholders.</p>

<h4><u>API Exchange (APEX)</u></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Digital Gov Efforts/apex_NewHeaderBanner.jpg">
</div>
<p>APEX is a self-service API platform that functions as a centralised and
secure API gateway and data sharing platform for the government.</p>
<p>The platform allows public officers to publish, monitor, and discover
APIs and datasets from across WOG conveniently, quickly, and securely.
This encourages co-creation among public agencies and the rapid development
of services as agencies can tap existing APIs and datasets instead of creating
new ones from scratch.</p>
<p>Through APEX’s central administration dashboard, government officers can
monitor system health checks and analytics</p>

<h4><u>Digital Workplace (DWP)</u></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Digital Gov Efforts/DWP_logo.png">
</div>
<p>DWP is a suite of productivity tools and digital enablers, designed to
allow public officers of any division and tech literacy to move through
the workday with ease, tapping on the power of today's digital tools.</p>
<p>Some of the products include CalSync, which allows public officers to
access work calenders on-the-go, Biometric logins, Visitor Management System,
and more.</p>
<p>This suite of tools facilitates cross-government collaboration and productivity,
creating a seamless working environment for public officers and ultimately
increasing efficiency.</p>
<h3>Ensuring security within the Digital Government with cybersecurity efforts</h3>
<p>As one of the five capability centres at GovTech, the Cybersecurity Group
(CSG) leads these efforts to develop the cybersecurity strategy for the
Government, secures the usage of government digital services for the public
and protects the Government’s ICT systems and Smart systems (ICT &amp;
SS).</p>
<p>The group's suite of cybersecurity capabilities range from blue-teaming
capabilities that detect and respond against cyber threats, to red-teaming
capabilities that uncover cyber vulnerabilities in Government’s ICT &amp;
SS.</p>
<p>Beyond developing cyber-defence capabilities, this centre also develops
cybersecurity policies and guidelines for agencies, works with agencies
to implement secure architectures and provides cybersecurity technical
guidance that help build a safer, more secure Smart Nation for our citizens
and businesses.</p>
