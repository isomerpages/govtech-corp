<h3>Providing citizens and businesses with a single touchpoint to government services</h3>
<p>GovTech is committed to increasing convenience for citizens, ensuring
that users can locate specific government offerings easily and quickly
without hassle.</p>
<p>As a key component of Singapore's digital government transformation, streamlining
users' journeys as they access government services is highly important.</p>
<p>To encourage user engagement and ensure that services are easily discovered,
a data-driven approach was used to ensure that the service recommendations
are customised for different user profiles on both platforms.</p>
<h3>Increasing convenience through centralised systems and platforms</h3>
<p>Digitalising government services with quick and convenient online systems
supports the growth of businesses, from start-ups to multinational corporations.</p>
<p>With GoBusiness, business owners enjoy easy access to government e-services
and a tailored journey to executing business transactions, saving them
time and costs.</p>

<h3><strong>Delivering seamless digital experiences by simplifying the user journey</strong></h3>
<p>- As online transactions become increasingly common, it is crucial that
governments support citizens by designing digital services that are easy
to access and navigate. Putting citizens’ needs first can build public
trust and yield positive outcomes for both the public sector and citizens.</p>
<p><u>LifeSG</u>
</p>
<p>- LifeSG smartphone app grants citizens simpler access to over 70 life
journey services from various government agencies on just one app. The
app has more than 330,000 downloads since its inception in 2018.</p>
<p>- Through the app, users can apply for government assistance schemes,
benefits, events and more. For intuitive use and a personalised experience,
government services are grouped according to major life milestones and
relevant events. These include birth registration and applying for the
baby bonus (family and parenting), buying an HDB flat (housing and property),
signing up for skills upgrading (career and employment), and finding out
how to manage healthcare costs in Singapore.</p>

<p>GovTech is committed to provide citizens and businesses with a simplified
user journey and a single touchpoint to government services. To ensure
that users can locate specific government offerings easily, platforms that
consolidate government services from multiple agencies, such as the LifeSG
app for citizens and GoBusiness website for businesses, were rolled out
for quick and convenient access. More services will be progressively added
to these digital services.</p>
<p>To encourage user engagement and ensure that services are easily discovered,
a data-driven approach was used to ensure that the service recommendations
are customised for different user profiles on both platforms.</p>

<p>As online transactions become increasingly common, it is crucial that
governments support citizens by designing digital services that are easy
to access and navigate. Putting citizens’ needs first can build public
trust and yield positive outcomes for both the public sector and citizens.</p>
<p>Our goal is to deliver a seamless digital experience when accessing government
services, such as those relating to citizens’ major life events, even when
different agencies are involved. As part of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative,
GovTech’s LifeSG smartphone app grants citizens simpler access to over
70 life journey services from various government agencies on just one app.
The app has more than 330,000 downloads since its inception in 2018.</p>

<p>GovTech strives to improve the LifeSG app by progressively adding new
features based on user feedback and testing to meet evolving citizen needs.
Examples include an Active Ageing module for seniors and an Employment
Support Guide for job seekers that were rolled out during the Covid-19
pandemic. Given the multitude of government digital services and content
on LifeSG, a personalised dashboard has been set up to enable citizens
to easily discover relevant and recommended services, as well as the latest
government schemes.</p>
<p>The app has also demonstrated its vast one-stop functionalities by being
the platform for the nation-wide offering of the SingaporeRediscovers tourism
vouchers, an initiative aimed at revitalising Singapore’s economy in late
2020. Since the release of the vouchers on the app, more than 140,000 users
have used it to view their vouchers.</p>

Companies benefit from time and cost savings when business-related government
transactions and guides can be accessed virtually.</p>

<h2>GoBusiness</h2>
<p>On the GoBusiness portal, business owners can locate their needs quickly
and access over 300 government e-services, including business registration,
licence and grant applications with the GoBusiness e-Services Navigator.
There are also e-advisers which provide recommendations on how to start
up a business, the licenses businesses should apply for based on their
business intents, and suitable government assistance schemes for them.

personalised dashboard recommending relevant e-services will be launched
to improve discoverability of these e-services and provide more comprehensive
user journeys that cater to different business profiles.</p>
