<h3>Providing users with a single touchpoint to government services</h3>
<p>GovTech is committed to increasing convenience for citizens, ensuring
that users can locate specific government offerings easily and quickly
without hassle.</p>
<p>As a key component of Singapore's digital government transformation, streamlining
users' journeys as they access government services is highly important.</p>
<p>To encourage user engagement and ensure that services are easily discovered,
a data-driven approach was used to ensure that the service recommendations
are customised for different user profiles on both platforms.</p>
<h3>Increasing convenience through centralised platforms</h3>
<p>Digitalising government services with quick and convenient online systems
supports the growth of businesses, from start-ups to multinational corporations.</p>
<p>With GoBusiness, business owners enjoy easy access to government e-services
and a tailored journey to executing business transactions, saving them
time and costs.</p>
