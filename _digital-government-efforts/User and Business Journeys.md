GovTech is committed to provide citizens and businesses with a simplified user journey and a single touchpoint to government services. To ensure that users can locate specific government offerings easily, platforms that consolidate government services from multiple agencies, such as the LifeSG app for citizens and GoBusiness website for businesses, were rolled out for quick and convenient access. More services will be progressively added to these digital services.

To encourage user engagement and ensure that services are easily discovered, a data-driven approach was used to ensure that the service recommendations are customised for different user profiles on both platforms.

As online transactions become increasingly common, it is crucial that governments support citizens by designing digital services that are easy to access and navigate. Putting citizens’ needs first can build public trust and yield positive outcomes for both the public sector and citizens.

Our goal is to deliver a seamless digital experience when accessing government services, such as those relating to citizens’ major life events, even when different agencies are involved. As part of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, GovTech’s LifeSG smartphone app grants citizens simpler access to over 70 life journey services from various government agencies on just one app. The app has more than 330,000 downloads since its inception in 2018.

Through the app, users can apply for government assistance schemes, benefits, events and more. For intuitive use and a personalised experience, government services are grouped according to major life milestones and relevant events. These include birth registration and applying for the baby bonus (family and parenting), buying an HDB flat (housing and property), signing up for skills upgrading (career and employment), and finding out how to manage healthcare costs in Singapore.

GovTech strives to improve the LifeSG app by progressively adding new features based on user feedback and testing to meet evolving citizen needs. Examples include an Active Ageing module for seniors and an Employment Support Guide for job seekers that were rolled out during the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the multitude of government digital services and content on LifeSG, a personalised dashboard has been set up to enable citizens to easily discover relevant and recommended services, as well as the latest government schemes.

The app has also demonstrated its vast one-stop functionalities by being the platform for the nation-wide offering of the SingaporeRediscovers tourism vouchers, an initiative aimed at revitalising Singapore’s economy in late 2020. Since the release of the vouchers on the app, more than 140,000 users have used it to view their vouchers.

Digitalising government services with quick and convenient online systems supports the growth of businesses, from start-ups to multinational corporations. Companies benefit from time and cost savings when business-related government transactions and guides can be accessed virtually.

In Singapore, business owners enjoy easy access to government e-services and a tailored journey on the GoBusiness website. Jointly developed by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), and GovTech, GoBusiness integrates government resources and e-services that are relevant to businesses across different sectors into a single, centralised platform. 

## GoBusiness

On the GoBusiness portal, business owners can locate their needs quickly and access over 300 government e-services, including business registration, licence and grant applications with the GoBusiness e-Services Navigator. There are also e-advisers which provide recommendations on how to start up a business, the licenses businesses should apply for based on their business intents, and suitable government assistance schemes for them. Additionally, the website contains guides for businesses, and opportunities for business growth through the GeBIZ portal.  

Designed to be a one-stop portal for business owners, GoBusiness receives a monthly average of 200,000 visits, and its Business Grants Portal processed more than 60,000 requests for business assistance in 2020.

As part of our efforts to support businesses in Singapore, more services will be progressively added to the GoBusiness platform. Come 2022, a new personalised dashboard recommending relevant e-services will be launched to improve discoverability of these e-services and provide more comprehensive user journeys that cater to different business profiles.
