<h3>Delivering seamless digital experiences by simplifying the user journey</h3>
<p>As online transactions become increasingly common, it is crucial that
governments support citizens by designing digital services that are easy
to access and navigate. Putting citizens’ needs first can build public
trust and yield positive outcomes for both the public sector and citizens.</p>
