<h3>Driving the digital transformation of Singapore's public sector</h3>
<p>Through our Digital Government Blueprint, we aspire to create a government
that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart.” This means that transacting
with the government will be easy, seamless, and secure.</p>
<p>It also means that public officers will continually upskill and work collaboratively
across agencies to drive digitalisation within the government and offer
better services to citizens and businesses.</p>
<h3>Engineering a Digital Government through a Shared Stack</h3>
<p>In line with the Digital Government Blueprint, we need to enable a consistent
service standard across the Government comprising user-centric services
that do not compromise on security. Thus, a robust development stack that
supports modern application development across the Government has been
adopted.</p>
<h4><u>Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)</u></h4>

Group (CSG) leads these efforts to develop the cybersecurity strategy for
the Government, secures the usage of government digital services for the
public and protects the Government’s ICT systems and Smart systems (ICT
&amp; SS).</p>
<p>- The group's suite of cybersecurity capabilities range from blue-teaming
capabilities that detect and respond against cyber threats, to red-teaming
capabilities that uncover cyber vulnerabilities in Government’s ICT &amp;
SS.</p>
<p>- Beyond developing cyber-defence capabilities, this centre also develops
cybersecurity policies and guidelines for agencies, works with agencies
to implement secure architectures and provides cybersecurity technical
guidance that help build a safer, more secure Smart Nation for our citizens
and businesses.</p>

<p>GovTech is the lead government agency driving Singapore's public sector
digital transformation. Through our [Digital Government Blueprint], we
aspire to create a government that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves
with Heart.” This means that transacting with the government will be easy,
seamless, and secure. It also means that public officers will continually
upskill and work collaboratively across agencies to drive digitalisation
within the government and offer better services to citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>The Singapore Government Tech Stack is an example of this as it provides
all government agencies with a common suite of tools and services on a
shared infrastructure to allow for faster application development and quality
maintenance within the government.</p>
<hr>
<p>Singapore government development practices are aligned to our Digital
Government Blueprint of creating a world-class digital government in a
Smart Nation that leverages the latest technology to serve our citizens
and businesses. To do so, we need to enable a consistent service standard
across the Government comprising user-centric services that do not compromise
on security. Thus, a robust development stack that supports modern application
development across the Government has been adopted. Apart from leveraging
cloud technologies securely, the Singapore government also aims to cultivate
in-house engineering expertise, bring engineering efforts across the whole-of-government
(WOG) closer, and simplify code collaboration and reuse.</p>
<h2>Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)</h2>
<p>The Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) provides all government agencies
with a shared digital infrastructure, services, and tools. It comprises
software and infrastructure components that are scalable, reusable, and
interoperable. The two layers of the SGTS are the base and services layers,
which contain components that cover the entire app development life cycle.</p>
<p>Through the SGTS, government agencies can develop applications in a better,
smarter, and faster way as they can now tap a ready suite of products and
services to produce services of a high quality and standard. This streamlines
development processes and allows citizens and businesses to experience
a more secure, seamless, consistent, and connected user experience across
government digital services. SGTS also facilitates a collaborative engineering
culture within the Government by creating a common source code repository.</p>
<h2>Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC)</h2>
<p>GCC allows less sensitive government systems and information to be stored
on a cloud computing platform. It provides agencies with a means of adopting
commercial cloud solutions offered by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google without
compromising on cybersecurity. Currently, more than 600 government systems
have migrated to cloud.</p>
<p>By tapping cloud computing platforms, government agencies can circumvent
racking, stacking, and maintaining on-site computing hardware. This gives
development teams more time to focus on software engineering and delivering
digital applications to internal and external stakeholders. GCC also enables
government agencies to tap commercial cloud software when integrating advanced
functionalities into government digital services, reducing the development
timeline.</p>
<p>Given the rapidly changing digital landscape, GCC has been redesigned
to leverage existing native cloud capabilities and increase its alignment
with cloud security practices. The new GCC 2.0 will include new features
such as access to an updated Cloud Management Portal, new experiences in
endpoint device management, more reliance on native tools for speed and
security, and faster and more controls for agencies. This empowers government
officers to accelerate the development of digital government services with
greater cost savings and security.</p>
<h2>API Exchange (APEX)</h2>
<p>APEX is a self-service API platform that functions as a centralised and
secure API gateway and data sharing platform for the government. APEX allows
public officers to publish, monitor, and discover APIs and datasets from
across WOG conveniently, quickly, and securely. This encourages co-creation
among public agencies and the rapid development of services as agencies
can tap existing APIs and datasets instead of creating new ones from scratch.</p>
<p>Through APEX’s central administration dashboard, government officers can
monitor system health checks and analytics. Other key features of APEX
include its self-service model, provision of professional services, ability
to support multi-tenanted Environments and modern RESTful and SOAP APIs.</p>
<p>Currently, APEX services over 100 million API calls monthly and supports
approximately 2,400 API functions from government agencies in Singapore.
31 government agencies have been onboarded onto APEX, resulting in the
housing of 44 projects.</p>

<p>Pre-booking allows citizens to enjoy greater convenience when utilising
in-person services as it reduces unnecessary waiting times and allows citizens
to better schedule their activities. When designing pre-booking services,
it is critical that the needs of both citizens and service providers are
met. On top of the end-user experience, services must be intuitive for
service administrators and providers to promote adoption and ensure smooth
service delivery.</p>
<p>By optimising the experience of agencies and end users in GovTech’s pre-booking
services, we ensure consistently high-quality service experiences for all
users, in all contexts, regardless of their angle of interaction with the
digital service.</p>
<p>The importance of pre-booking services has also increased due to COVID-19
mandated crowd control policies and the need to allow service providers
to conduct preparations such as sanitisation beforehand.</p>
<h2>BookingSG</h2>
<p>BookingSG enables government agencies to offer pre-booking services to
citizens, and this allows for locations to conduct preparations beforehand.
It also enhances operational efficiency by providing a single touchpoint
for agencies to design booking interfaces, have an overview of and manage
booking requests directly, or assign global rules for automated management
of requests.</p>
<p>BookingSG is well fitted for both its administrators and end users as
it can be leveraged as a Calendaring, Availability, Rostering and Booking
(CARB) management tool by agencies or as part of a user journey by citizens.
It can also be used as an engine to serve highly complicated use cases
by integrating BookingSG’s API to access its CARB logic.</p>
