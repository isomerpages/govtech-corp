<h3>Cultivating a Digital Government that is "Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart"</h3>
<p>GovTech's dedication to developing technologies that are tailored to the
needs of citizens and businesses, empowering them to achieve a greater
quality of life.</p>
<p>This was exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, where digital infrastructures
were enhanced and developed to support public health facilities, disseminate
public communications and contain the spread of the virus. Products and
services like TraceTogether, SafeEntry and HealthCerts enabled a coordinated
approach that improves convenience for citizens as we combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>Today, we at GovTech continue to develop tech for public good through
products like Personal Alert Buttons (PABs) to assist the elderly community
and eCanvas for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) - using technology as
a catalyst for public good, community development and change.</p>
<h3>How we drive the digitalisation of Singapore with Smart City technologies</h3>
<p>As part of our role in the Government, GovTech aims to harness technologies
to support the Singapore's vision of becoming a smart city. This includes
the use of sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) to build a more connected
living experience.</p>
<h4><u>Open Digital Platform (ODP)</u></h4>

smart city operating system that integrates various district management
operations onto a single platform, such as facilities, district cooling

<p>ODP also formed the digital backbone of Punggol Digital District - the
first smart district in Singapore, where data is collected and operational
activities can be managed on a centralised platform which allows for more
efficient management of the estate.</p>

<h3>How we supported Singaporeans through COVID-19</h3>
<p>To develop and scale digital solutions quickly, GovTech leveraged its
robust digital infrastructure and strong engineering capabilities to meet
citizen and business needs. National portals and initiatives were successfully
implemented as a result.</p>
<p>The result was a suite of products that worked seamlessly together to
drive the response operations for the pandemic, enabling the government
to efficiently facilitate activities like contact tracing and safe distancing,
while maintaining convenience and support for the public.</p>
<h4>Some of the key products developed during COVID-19 include:</h4>
