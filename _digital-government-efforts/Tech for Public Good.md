<h3>Digital to the core and serves with heart</h3>
<p>At GovTech, we are dedicated to developing technologies that are tailored
to the needs of citizens and businesses, enabling them to achieve a greater
quality of life.</p>
<p>This was exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, where digital infrastructures
were enhanced and developed to support public health facilities, disseminate
public communications and contain the spread of the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Products and services like TraceTogether, SafeEntry and HealthCerts led
to a coordinated approach that improved convenience for citizens as we
combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>Today, we at GovTech continue to develop tech for public good through
products like Personal Alert Buttons (PABs) to assist the elderly community
and eCanvas for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) - using technology as
a catalyst for public good, community development and change.</p>
<h3>Driving digitalisation through Smart City tech</h3>
<p>GovTech aims to harness technologies to support Singapore's vision of
becoming a smart city. This includes the use of sensors and Internet-of-Things
(IoT) to build a more connected living experience.</p>
<h4>Our award-winning Open Digital Platform (ODP)</h4>

<h3>How we supported Singaporeans through COVID-19</h3>
<p>To develop and scale digital solutions quickly, GovTech leveraged its
robust digital infrastructure and strong engineering capabilities to meet
citizen and business needs. National portals and initiatives were successfully
implemented as a result.</p>
<p>The result was a suite of products that worked seamlessly together to
drive the response operations for the pandemic, enabling the government
to efficiently facilitate activities like contact tracing and safe distancing,
while maintaining convenience and support for the public.</p>
<h4>Some of the key products developed during COVID-19 include:</h4>

a log of individuals that one has been in close contact. It also worked
with SafeEntry, to facilitate tracking and check-ins at public spaces.
Since its launch, over 60 countries have indicated an interest in its technology,
with Australia, Canada, and Poland adapting the open-source version of
TraceTogether.</p>

for citizens to access all official COVID-19 related information and government
guides efficiently and quickly, and location query-based websites that
have helped facilitate nation-wide distribution exercises. Even though
this product was created in response to the pandemic, it has since then
been built upon as a continued valuable resource for citizens, with new
directories like BudgetGoWhere being added.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/analytics/vas/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Video Analytics System (VAS)</a>:</h4>
