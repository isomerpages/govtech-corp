<h3>Cultivating a Digital Government that is "Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart"</h3>
<p>GovTech's dedication to developing technologies that are tailored to the
needs of citizens and businesses, empowering them to achieve a greater
quality of life.</p>
<p>This was exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, where digital infrastructures
were enhanced and developed to support public health facilities, disseminate
public communications and contain the spread of the virus. Products and
services like TraceTogether, SafeEntry and HealthCerts enabled a coordinated
approach that improves convenience for citizens as we combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>Today, we at GovTech continue to develop tech for public good through
products like Personal Alert Buttons (PABs) to assist the elderly community
and eCanvas for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) - using technology as
a catalyst for public good, community development and change.</p>
<h3>How we drive the digitalisation of Singapore with Smart City technologies</h3>
<p>As part of our role in the Government, GovTech aims to harness technologies
to support the Singapore's vision of becoming a smart city. This includes
the use of sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) to build a more connected
living experience.</p>
<h4><u>Open Digital Platform (ODP)</u></h4>

<p>To cultivate a Digital Government that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves
with Heart,” GovTech has developed technologies that are not only tailored
to the needs of our citizens and businesses but also empower them to achieve
a greater quality of life.</p>
<p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, digital infrastructures and technologies
were enhanced and developed to contain the spread of the virus, support
public health facilities, and disseminate public communications and resources
to citizens and businesses. This enabled Singapore to combat COVID-19 through
a coordinated technology-focused approach.</p>
<p>By driving a whole of government (WOG) digital transformation strategy
and engaging in public-private collaborations to co-create a technology
enabled-future, GovTech uses technology to be a catalyst for public good,
community development and change.</p>
<h2>We Build For Everyone</h2>
<p>When planning out digital government services, our GovTech teams go beyond
the usual product brief with the idea of “Designing for the 100%” to consider
accessibility use cases for digital inclusion. As more services become
digital, by ensuring accessibility wider than the majority, we will be
able to provide better user experiences for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Here's some GovTech products with strong accessibility features:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Singpass</strong>
</p>
<p>Singpass is a mobile app that is designed to make transacting with government
and businesses faster and easier for all Singpass users.</p>
<p><strong>What has the team done to make the app inclusive?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Using QR Login, users can scan a QR code and verify their identity with
biometrics or a 6-digit pin code. This helps users with dexterity issues
transact with ease and reduces the need to remember long passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shortcuts to commonly used services within the app ensures no mistyping
of URLs when visiting different government digital services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The team also enabled high contrast for improved legibility and readability
when using the app</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SafeEntry features in the app was developed with accessibility in mind,
and tested extensively with VoiceOver and Voice Control for the visually
and physically handicapped respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Isomer</strong>
</p>
<p>Isomer is a static website builder for public officers to easily launch
informational sites.</p>
<p><strong>Isomer's Target Audience:</strong>
</p>
<p>Isomer’s audience include (a) content creators (public officers in comms
and marketing, policy officers and IT department) as well as software vendors
who partner government agencies (b) content consumers (Singaporean citizens
from all walks of life who visit Isomer-built websites)</p>
<p><strong>What has the team done to make Isomer more inclusive?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

manner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The team baked in as many accessibility features into Isomer as possible
by default.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the Isomer template provides a selection of predefined font
sizes and weights that cater to persons with low vision. Content editors
can focus on content, knowing the font size issue is well addressed.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>While the team was not able to set the use of alternate text for images
or a minimum color contrast ratio, they overcame these challenges by creating
documentation guides for easy referencing of accessibility guidelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) was developed to unite teams
in creating fast, accessible and mobile friendly digital services with
a common set of UI components that comply to the Digital Service Standards.</p>
<p><strong>SGDS's Target Audience:</strong>
</p>
<p>Government Agency Users, Vendors and the Public (to a certain extent,
everything is open source)</p>
<p><strong>What has the team done to make SGDS more inclusive?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>We also serve employers who are looking to hire locals for their jobs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What has the team done to make MCF more inclusive?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Linters are used to automatically flag issues that can reliably be detected
in that way e.g an image without the alt attribute, or a "button" implemented
using</p>
<p>which prevents it from being activated using a keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The team required accessibility as an acceptance criteria of new features
e.g, the ability to navigate a list of notifications via a keyboard, triggering
them and marking them read.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>In an increasingly digitalised world with an influx of information online,
it is vital for governments to provide a reliable and accurate source of
news and updates, particularly during a global crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic
has uncovered new and pressing demands for digital government services
to provide timely assistance and solutions to cope with the outbreak.</p>
<p>To develop and scale digital solutions quickly, GovTech leveraged its
robust digital infrastructure and strong engineering capabilities to meet
citizen and business needs. National portals and initiatives were successfully
implemented as a result.</p>
<h2>GoWhere Suite</h2>
<p>The GoWhere Suite consists of the GoWhere Directory, a one-stop national
resource hub for citizens to access all official COVID-19 related information
and government guides efficiently and quickly, and location query-based
websites that have helped facilitate nation-wide distribution exercises.
For example, TokenGoWhere, one of GoWhere’s suite of websites, facilitates
TraceTogether token collection and has recorded close to nine million visits
since September 2020 and been integral to COVID-19 communications efforts.
With inclusivity in mind, the GoWhere suite is available in Singapore’s
four official languages – English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil.</p>
<h2>Video Analytics System (VAS)</h2>
<p>Our whole-of-government Video Analytics System (VAS) features scalable
video sharing platform leveraging cloud services, on-demand Video Analytics
(VA) as a Service and VA enablement that allows you to train your own VA
models.</p>
<p>The Video Analytics System is one of the key technologies behind Safe
Distance @ Parks, the national website and app that shows users near real-time
crowd sizes for parks across Singapore. This is achieved by relaying image
snapshots captured by CCTV cameras in parks, at regular intervals, to VAS.
The technology proved useful for citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic
as citizens can access real-time information on visitor crowdedness online
without needing to physically visit the parks to gauge visitor levels.
VAS helps citizens to make informed decisions before visiting parks or
specific areas within big parks to avoid crowded areas, while also allowing
officers to be more efficiently deployed for safe distancing measures.
New features are being added to VAS and more use cases with government
agencies could be expected in future.</p>
<h2>SafeEntry</h2>
<p>In response to contact tracing efforts to minimise the spread of COVID-19,
SafeEntry was implemented as the national digital check-in system in 2020.
Built with inclusivity and accessibility in mind, SafeEntry is used by
more than 200,000 businesses and public venues handling over 15 million
check-ins daily, and supports our COVID-19’s response efforts by:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Reducing the time needed to identify individuals who have potentially
been in contact with COVID-19 clusters and cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrating with TraceTogether to support TraceTogether-only SafeEntry
check-ins to enhance contract tracing efforts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing venues to check visitors’ vaccination statuses to support vaccination-differentiated
safe management measures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>TraceTogether</h2>
<p>TraceTogether is a contact tracing technology that utilises Bluetooth
for contact tracing through the logging of encounters between users. It
allows a log of individuals that one has been in close contact, done in
a privacy-preserving manner. This is made possible as TraceTogether relies
only on the Bluetooth communication between TraceTogether devices to estimate
the duration and proximity of interaction between individuals. The data
exchanged is anonymised, encrypted, and stored only on users’ devices,
and shared with the Ministry of Health for healthcare follow-up if an individual
tests positive for COVID-19. To further protect data privacy, contact tracing
data stored on each TraceTogether device is automatically deleted after
25 days, and the TraceTogether solution will cease after the pandemic.
Since its launch, over 60 countries have indicated an interest in its technology,
with Australia, Canada, and Poland adapting the open-source version of
TraceTogether.</p>
<p>The Singapore Government has also donated TraceTogether’s open-sourced
code ‘OpenTrace’ to the Linux Foundation Public Health’s Herald Project,
in strong support of an open-source community around a non-GAEN contact
tracing standard.</p>
<p>Currently, over 99% of Singaporeans are currently using TraceTogether
as a community effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Through digital
contact tracing, the timeline to issue a quarantine order has been lessened
from four days to under two days.</p>

<p>Technology can empower and improve the quality of life for those in vulnerable
communities. Some benefits of assistive technologies include improved accessibility
and independence for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and seniors. To generate
greater social impact from digital tools and applications, digital governments
should take the lead in accelerating their development.</p>
<p>Through the Smart Nation initiative, we aim to use technology to build
an inclusive society for all citizens and enhance the well-being of vulnerable
communities. The implementation of assistive technologies is facilitated
by government systems designed to improve service delivery.</p>
<h2>eCanvas</h2>
<p>The eCanvas is a voice-controlled assistive technology that provides support
and greater independence for special needs users who have a passion for
painting. A microphone connected to the eCanvas processes voice commands
via a pre-trained neural network engine, allowing the canvas to move or
dispense paint in the corresponding paint colour on the palette accordingly.
Seven GovTech units have been deployed by partners from charity and social
service organisations to date, including for users with cerebral palsy.
In 2021, the eCanvas was featured in an art performance during the President’s
Star Charity (PSC) showcase, an annual fundraising campaign by the President’s
Office in Singapore.</p>
<h2>GatherSG</h2>
<p>GALE’s success highlighted strong demand for Case Collaboration tools
across government agencies, especially in areas of assisted-living, social
support and befrienders. Through GovTech’s engineering efforts, the technology
behind GALE is reused and scaled up, resulting in the development of GatherSG.
As the tech-stack version of GALE, GatherSG is a collaborative case coordination
system for whole-of-government. With features such as a Kanban board and
integrated video conferencing tool, it enables seamless data sharing among
public officers for more efficient management of government projects and
optimises cross-agency workflows to better serve citizens. Currently, there
are four live Case Management Systems, with two more in the pipeline for
various government agencies and the Ministry of Social and Family Development.
Across GALE and GatherSG, there are more than 780,000 clients onboarded
and more than 650,000 case triggered to date.</p>
