<h3>Digital to the core and serves with heart</h3>
<p>At GovTech, we are dedicated to developing technologies that are tailored
to the needs of citizens and businesses, enabling them to achieve a greater
quality of life.</p>
<p>This was exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, where digital infrastructures
were enhanced and developed to support public health facilities, disseminate
public communications and contain the spread of the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Products and services like TraceTogether, SafeEntry and HealthCerts led
to a coordinated approach that improved convenience for citizens as we
combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>Today, we at GovTech continue to develop tech for public good through
products like Personal Alert Buttons (PABs) to assist the elderly community
and eCanvas for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) - using technology as
a catalyst for public good, community development and change.</p>
<h3>Driving digitalisation through Smart City tech</h3>
<p>GovTech aims to harness technologies to support Singapore's vision of
becoming a smart city. This includes the use of sensors and Internet-of-Things
(IoT) to build a more connected living experience.</p>
<h4>Our award-winning Open Digital Platform (ODP)</h4>

</div>
<p>One of the key products developed in this area is ODP, a smart city operating
system that integrates various district management operations onto a single
platform, such as facilities, district cooling systems, security systems,
carpark systems and more.</p>
<p>ODP also formed the digital backbone of Punggol Digital District, the
first smart district in Singapore, where data is collected and operational
activities can be managed on a centralised platform which allows for more
efficient management of the estate.</p>

<h3>How we supported Singaporeans through COVID-19</h3>
<p>National portals and initiatives were successfully implemented as a result
of the robust digital infrastructure and strong engineering capabilities
that GovTech has forged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We built a suite of products that worked seamlessly together to drive
the response operations for the pandemic, enabling the government to efficiently
facilitate activities like contact tracing and safe distancing, while maintaining
convenience and support for the public.</p>
<h3>Key products developed during COVID-19</h3>
<p>Citizens relied on three key products during the height of the COVID-19
pandemic: TraceTogether, the GoWhere Suite and the Video Analytics System
(VAS). Together, they enabled citizens to navigate the turbulent period
with greater ease and manage the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>TraceTogether is a contact tracing technology that utilises Bluetooth
that allows a log of individuals that one has been in close contact with.
It also worked with SafeEntry, to facilitate tracking and check-ins at
public spaces.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/gowhere-suite/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GoWhere suite</a> contains
the GoWhere Directory, a one-stop national resource hub for citizens to
access all official COVID-19 related information and government guides
efficiently.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/analytics/vas/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Video Analytics System (VAS)</a><em> </em>was
behind Safe Distance @ Parks, the national website and app that displayed
near real-time crowd sizes for parks so citizens could plan accordingly.</p>
