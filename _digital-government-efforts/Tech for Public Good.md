To cultivate a Digital Government that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart,” GovTech has developed technologies that are not only tailored to the needs of our citizens and businesses but also empower them to achieve a greater quality of life. 

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, digital infrastructures and technologies were enhanced and developed to contain the spread of the virus, support public health facilities, and disseminate public communications and resources to citizens and businesses. This enabled Singapore to combat COVID-19 through a coordinated technology-focused approach. 

By driving a whole of government (WOG) digital transformation strategy and engaging in public-private collaborations to co-create a technology enabled-future, GovTech uses technology to be a catalyst for public good, community development and change.

## We Build For Everyone

When planning out digital government services, our GovTech teams go beyond the usual product brief with the idea of “Designing for the 100%” to consider accessibility use cases for digital inclusion. As more services become digital, by ensuring accessibility wider than the majority, we will be able to provide better user experiences for everyone.

**Here's some GovTech products with strong accessibility features:**

![accessibility SPM](/images/programmes/products-and-services/singpass-logo-new.png)

**Singpass**

Singpass is a mobile app that is designed to make transacting with government and businesses faster and easier for all Singpass users.

**What has the team done to make the app inclusive?**

 - Using QR Login, users can scan a QR code and verify their identity with biometrics or a 6-digit pin code. This helps users with dexterity issues transact with ease and reduces the need to remember long passwords.
 - Shortcuts to commonly used services within the app ensures no mistyping of URLs when visiting different government digital services
 - The team also enabled high contrast for improved legibility and readability when using the app
 - SafeEntry(www.safeentry.gov.sg) features in the app was developed with accessibility in mind, and tested extensively with VoiceOver and Voice Control for the visually and physically handicapped respectively.

![accessibility Isomer](/images/isomer-logo - Lisa T.png)

**Isomer**

Isomer is a static website builder for public officers to easily launch informational sites.

**Isomer's Target Audience:**

Isomer’s audience include (a) content creators (public officers in comms and marketing, policy officers and IT department) as well as software vendors who partner government agencies (b) content consumers  (Singaporean citizens from all walks of life who visit Isomer-built websites)

**What has the team done to make Isomer more inclusive?** 

 - Standard template for users to launch their websites in an easy and fast manner
 - The team baked in as many accessibility features into Isomer as possible by default.
 
For example, the Isomer template provides a selection of predefined font sizes and weights that cater to persons with low vision. Content editors can focus on content, knowing the font size issue is well addressed.

 - While the team was not able to set the use of alternate text for images or a minimum color contrast ratio, they overcame these challenges by creating documentation guides for easy referencing of accessibility guidelines.

 **Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)**

The Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) was developed to unite teams in creating fast, accessible and mobile friendly digital services with a common set of UI components that comply to the Digital Service Standards.

**SGDS's Target Audience:**

Government Agency Users, Vendors and the Public (to a certain extent, everything is open source)

**What has the team done to make SGDS more inclusive?** 

 - Baseline accessibility checks along with the team’s own a11y tool.
 - Created patterns with base accessibility built in.
 - Provided guidelines to help users.

![accessibility MCF](/images/Screenshot 2020-06-09 at 1.15.05 PM - Yvonne Chia.png)

**MyCareersFuture (MCF)**

MyCareersFuture helps match jobseekers to suitable employers and job opportunities based on their skills.

**MCF's Target Audience:**

 - Users include jobseekers and employers.
 - The primary intention was to support jobseekers in need of help such as mature Professionals, Managers, Executives, Technicians (PMETs) or mid-career switchers but we are really open to all citizens and PRs.
 - We also serve employers who are looking to hire locals for their jobs.
 
 **What has the team done to make MCF more inclusive?** 
 
 - Linters are used to automatically flag issues that can reliably be detected in that way e.g an image without the alt attribute, or a "button" implemented using <div> which prevents it from being activated using a keyboard.
 - The team required accessibility as an acceptance criteria of new features e.g, the ability to navigate a list of notifications via a keyboard, triggering them and marking them read.
 - Holding informal audits to see if important user flows can be accomplished with a keyboard, and fixing critical bugs.

In an increasingly digitalised world with an influx of information online, it is vital for governments to provide a reliable and accurate source of news and updates, particularly during a global crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered new and pressing demands for digital government services to provide timely assistance and solutions to cope with the outbreak.

To develop and scale digital solutions quickly, GovTech leveraged its robust digital infrastructure and strong engineering capabilities to meet citizen and business needs. National portals and initiatives were successfully implemented as a result. 

## GoWhere Suite

The GoWhere Suite consists of the GoWhere Directory, a one-stop national resource hub for citizens to access all official COVID-19 related information and government guides efficiently and quickly, and location query-based websites that have helped facilitate nation-wide distribution exercises. For example, TokenGoWhere, one of GoWhere’s suite of websites, facilitates TraceTogether token collection and has recorded close to nine million visits since September 2020 and been integral to COVID-19 communications efforts. With inclusivity in mind, the GoWhere suite is available in Singapore’s four official languages – English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. 

## Video Analytics System (VAS)

Our whole-of-government Video Analytics System (VAS) features scalable video sharing platform leveraging cloud services, on-demand Video Analytics (VA) as a Service and VA enablement that allows you to train your own VA models.

The Video Analytics System is one of the key technologies behind Safe Distance @ Parks, the national website and app that shows users near real-time crowd sizes for parks across Singapore. This is achieved by relaying image snapshots captured by CCTV cameras in parks, at regular intervals, to VAS. The technology proved useful for citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic as citizens can access real-time information on visitor crowdedness online without needing to physically visit the parks to gauge visitor levels. VAS helps citizens to make informed decisions before visiting parks or specific areas within big parks to avoid crowded areas, while also allowing officers to be more efficiently deployed for safe distancing measures. New features are being added to VAS and more use cases with government agencies could be expected in future.

## SafeEntry

In response to contact tracing efforts to minimise the spread of COVID-19, SafeEntry was implemented as the national digital check-in system in 2020. Built with inclusivity and accessibility in mind, SafeEntry is used by more than 200,000 businesses and public venues handling over 15 million check-ins daily, and supports our COVID-19’s response efforts by:
1.	Reducing the time needed to identify individuals who have potentially been in contact with COVID-19 clusters and cases
2.	Integrating with TraceTogether to support TraceTogether-only SafeEntry check-ins to enhance contract tracing efforts
3.	Allowing venues to check visitors’ vaccination statuses to support vaccination-differentiated safe management measures.

## TraceTogether

TraceTogether is a contact tracing technology that utilises Bluetooth for contact tracing through the logging of encounters between users. It allows a log of individuals that one has been in close contact, done in a privacy-preserving manner. This is made possible as TraceTogether relies only on the Bluetooth communication between TraceTogether devices to estimate the duration and proximity of interaction between individuals. The data exchanged is anonymised, encrypted, and stored only on users’ devices, and shared with the Ministry of Health for healthcare follow-up if an individual tests positive for COVID-19. To further protect data privacy, contact tracing data stored on each TraceTogether device is automatically deleted after 25 days, and the TraceTogether solution will cease after the pandemic. Since its launch, over 60 countries have indicated an interest in its technology, with Australia, Canada, and Poland adapting the open-source version of TraceTogether.

The Singapore Government has also donated TraceTogether’s open-sourced code ‘OpenTrace’ to the Linux Foundation Public Health’s Herald Project, in strong support of an open-source community around a non-GAEN contact tracing standard.

Currently, over 99% of Singaporeans are currently using TraceTogether as a community effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Through digital contact tracing, the timeline to issue a quarantine order has been lessened from four days to under two days.

Technology can empower and improve the quality of life for those in vulnerable communities. Some benefits of assistive technologies include improved accessibility and independence for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and seniors. To generate greater social impact from digital tools and applications, digital governments should take the lead in accelerating their development.

Through the Smart Nation initiative, we aim to use technology to build an inclusive society for all citizens and enhance the well-being of vulnerable communities. The implementation of assistive technologies is facilitated by government systems designed to improve service delivery.

## eCanvas

The eCanvas is a voice-controlled assistive technology that provides support and greater independence for special needs users who have a passion for painting. A microphone connected to the eCanvas processes voice commands via a pre-trained neural network engine, allowing the canvas to move or dispense paint in the corresponding paint colour on the palette accordingly.  Seven GovTech units have been deployed by partners from charity and social service organisations to date, including for users with cerebral palsy. In 2021, the eCanvas was featured in an art performance during the President’s Star Charity (PSC) showcase, an annual fundraising campaign by the President’s Office in Singapore.

## GatherSG

GALE’s success highlighted strong demand for Case Collaboration tools across government agencies, especially in areas of assisted-living, social support and befrienders. Through GovTech’s engineering efforts, the technology behind GALE is reused and scaled up, resulting in the development of GatherSG. As the tech-stack version of GALE, GatherSG is a collaborative case coordination system for whole-of-government. With features such as a Kanban board and integrated video conferencing tool, it enables seamless data sharing among public officers for more efficient management of government projects and optimises cross-agency workflows to better serve citizens. Currently, there are four live Case Management Systems, with two more in the pipeline for various government agencies and the Ministry of Social and Family Development. Across GALE and GatherSG, there are more than 780,000 clients onboarded and more than 650,000 case triggered to date.
