<h3>Our journey to net zero with the Singapore Green Plan 2030</h3>
<p>In 2021, the Singapore Government unveiled the <a href="https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Green Plan 2030</a>, an
ambitious and rigorous strategy that outlines the country’s long-term plan
to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 with the public sector leading the
way.</p>
<p>As the public sector’s centre of excellence for info-comm technology and
smart systems (ICT&amp;SS), one of our key <u>focus areas</u> (Link to "About
Us - Our Journey - Our Focus Areas" page) is to take the lead in decarbonising
public sector technology in order to mitigate global warming and secure
a smart and sustainable future for the people living in Singapore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is fortuitous that I was given this role to be the sustainability
lead for GovTech, where together with my team, we drive the sustainability
agenda as a convenor and orchestrator of all internal and external stakeholders
and touchpoints of GovTech, as we build the foundation to move towards
our 2045 Net Zero goal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Liew Hui Ming, Director, Digitalisation Strategy &amp; Partnership Office</p>
