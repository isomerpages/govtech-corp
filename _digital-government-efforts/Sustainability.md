<h3>Environmental Sustainability at GovTech</h3>
<p><em>Our Journey to Net Zero</em>
</p>
<p>In 2021, the Singapore Government unveiled the <a href="https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Green Plan 2030</a>{:target="_blank"},
an ambitious and rigorous strategy that outlines the country’s long-term
plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 with the public sector leading
the way.</p>
<p>As the public sector’s centre of excellence for info-comm technology and
smart systems (ICT&amp;SS), we are taking the lead in decarbonising public
sector technology in order to mitigate global warming and secure a smart
and sustainable future for the people living in Singapore.</p>
<p>&gt; “It is fortuitous that I was given this role to be the sustainability
lead for GovTech, where together with my team, we drive the sustainability
agenda as a convenor and orchestrator of all internal and external stakeholders
and touchpoints of GovTech, as we build the foundation to move towards
our 2045 Net Zero goal." - Liew Hui Ming, Director, Digitalisation Strategy
&amp; Partnership Office</p>
