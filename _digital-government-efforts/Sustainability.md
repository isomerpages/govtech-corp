<h3>Our journey to net zero</h3>
<p>In 2021, the Singapore Government unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030,
an ambitious and rigorous strategy that outlines the country’s long-term
plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 with the public sector leading
the way.</p>
<p>As the public sector’s centre of excellence for info-comm technology and
smart systems (ICT&amp;SS), one of our <a href="/about-us/our-journey/our-focus-areas/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">key focus areas</a> is to
take the lead in decarbonising public sector technology to mitigate global
warming and secure a smart and sustainable future for the people living
in Singapore.</p>
