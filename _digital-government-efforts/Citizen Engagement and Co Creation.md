<h3>Co-creating tech solutions with citizens</h3>
<p>At GovTech, we believe that public engagement and participation will help
us identify the needs of citizens accurately and effectively enhance government
products and services. This is facilitated by GovTech's communities, such
as Tech Kaki — a community of tech enthusiasts who provide user insights
that feed into the development of GovTech's products and services.</p>
<p>This is exemplified by the enhancement of the LifeSG app in 2020 based
on citizen feedback to include personalised services such as those for
job hunting, tax management and CPF matters, as well as to include benefits
for citizens in the form of SkillFuture credits, SingaporeRediscover Vouchers
and MINDEF Celebratory Gifts for NSmen. An improved user navigation and
a citizen profile were also added to enhance the user experience. Previously,
the app was centred on services for parents and seniors.</p>
<h3>How co-creation and open-source tech are catalysing innovations</h3>
<p>Public-private collaboration encourages new ideas and more innovative
government offerings. To facilitate knowledge sharing and exchanges, governments
and private companies can share open-source technologies to generate awareness
and drive adoption of products and services domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>Open channels of engagement are also important sources of citizen and
industry feedback that governments can use to garner insights and improve
solutions.</p>
<h4><u>Open Source Tech</u></h4>
<p>Singapore government agencies’ open-source technologies, such as those
relating to our National Digital Identity, Infrastructure-as-code and OpenAttestation
framework, are accessible to all developers on GitHub and product websites,
as well as on the Singapore Government Developer Portal.</p>
<p>For example, Canada has adopted OpenCerts, a platform/product built by
GovTech using blockchain technology that allows Singapore’s digital education
and training institutions to issue digital certificates to students upon
the completion of their course of study.</p>

<h4><u>STACK Community</u></h4>
<p>- Include logo of community</p>
<p>Conceived in 2019, GovTech's STACK community, comprising of STACK and
STACKx sub-community groups, brings together like-minded tech experts who
share a passion for driving Tech for Public Good in innovative ways.</p>
<p>Today, the community comprises of over 5,000 members who share an excitement
for using technology to improve lives and contribute to building Singapore
into a Smart Nation using the SG Tech Stack. The STACK developer conference
is also the largest Government-led, biennial developer conference in Singapore,
connecting the government, industry, and the tech community.</p>

<h4><u>Tech Kaki Community</u></h4>
<p>- Include logo of community</p>
<p>Tech Kaki was set up in 2016 to engage a citizen community in the development
process of our digital products and services, ensuring that these are designed
to meet the needs of citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>Today, the community comprises of over 7,000 members who co-create with
GovTech and make an impact on government products and services. Members
from all walks of life work alongside GovTech teams in focus group discussions
and user-testing sessions, etc., to provide feedback on digital services
that are being developed.</p>

<p>Engaging citizens to co-create solutions can help governments identify
delivery gaps in government services. At GovTech, we believe that public
engagement and participation will help us identify citizen's needs more
accurately and refine government products and services.</p>
<p>This is exemplified by the enhancement of the LifeSG app in 2020 based
on citizen feedback to include personalised services such as those for
job hunting, tax management and CPF matters, as well as to include benefits
for citizens in the form of SkillFuture credits, SingaporeRediscover Vouchers
and MINDEF Celebratory Gifts for NSmen. An improved user navigation and
a citizen profile was also added to enhance the user experience. Previously,

<p>Public-private collaboration encourages new ideas and more innovative
government offerings. To facilitate knowledge sharing and exchanges, governments
and private companies can share open-source technologies to generate awareness
and drive adoption of products and services domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>Open channels of engagement are also important sources of citizen and
industry feedback that governments can use to garner insights and improve
solutions. GovTech has an active “Tech Kaki” (‘kaki’ means ‘friend’ in
Malay) community of more than 7,000 users. We also organise tech events
covering a wide range of topics from cybersecurity to product management.
These are well-received by the tech community, who in turn have shared
that they gained a deeper understanding of government products and services
as a result. To date, these events have extended GovTech’s outreach to
over 6,500 participants and provided interesting pointers for our developers
to work on.</p>
<h2>Open-source Tech</h2>
<p>Singapore government agencies’ open-source technologies, such as those
relating to our National Digital Identity, Infrastructure-as-code and OpenAttestation
framework, are accessible to all developers on GitHub and product websites,
as well as on the Singapore Government Developer Portal.</p>
<p>For instance, Canada has adopted OpenCerts, a platform/product built by
GovTech using blockchain technology. OpenCerts allows Singapore’s digital
education and training institutions to issue digital certificates to students
upon the completion of their course of study. GovTech also helped to develop
TradeTrust, an open-sourced technology that is being used in cross border
digital trade. TradeTrust allows secure exchange of electronic trade documents
across digital platforms through blockchain technology and can be used
for global trade between governments and businesses by enabling interoperability
across different trade platforms and formats.</p>
<h2>STACK Community</h2>
<p>The STACK community comprises of the STACK, STACK-X and Capture-the-Flag
community groups. STACK is the largest Government-led, biennial developer
conference in Singapore, connecting the government, industry, and the tech
community. The first STACK conference was conducted in 2018. Thereafter,
GovTech has kickstarted smaller-scale STACK-X Conferences and STACK-X Meetup
sessions aimed at building stronger community bonds and peer learning across
a wide range of tech topics. The STACK brand was also expanded to include
a Capture-the-Flag competition for our Cybersecurity Group.</p>
<h2>Tech Kaki</h2>
<p>Tech Kaki is a user insights community set up by GovTech to encourage
citizen engagement and co-creation. Community tech enthusiasts get first-hand
information on new tech products before launch, and are invited to participate
in surveys and highlight areas for improvement.</p>
