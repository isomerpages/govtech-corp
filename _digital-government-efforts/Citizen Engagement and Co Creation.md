<h3>Co-creating tech solutions with citizens</h3>
<p>At GovTech, we believe that public engagement and participation will help
us identify the needs of citizens accurately and effectively enhance government
products and services. This is facilitated by GovTech's communities, such
as Tech Kaki — a community of tech enthusiasts who provide user insights
that feed into the development of GovTech's products and services.</p>
<p>This is exemplified by the enhancement of the LifeSG app in 2020 based
on citizen feedback to include personalised services such as those for
job hunting, tax management and CPF matters, as well as to include benefits
for citizens in the form of SkillFuture credits, SingaporeRediscover Vouchers
and MINDEF Celebratory Gifts for NSmen. An improved user navigation and
a citizen profile were also added to enhance the user experience. Previously,
the app was centred on services for parents and seniors.</p>
<h3>How co-creation and open-source tech are catalysing innovations</h3>
<p>Public-private collaboration encourages new ideas and more innovative
government offerings. To facilitate knowledge sharing and exchanges, governments
and private companies can share open-source technologies to generate awareness
and drive adoption of products and services domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>Open channels of engagement are also important sources of citizen and
industry feedback that governments can use to garner insights and improve
solutions.</p>
<h4><u>Open Source Tech</u></h4>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Digital Gov Efforts/Open_source_tech__compressed_.jpg">
</div>
<p>Singapore government agencies’ open-source technologies, such as those
relating to our National Digital Identity, Infrastructure-as-code and OpenAttestation
framework, are accessible to all developers on GitHub and product websites,
as well as on the Singapore Government Developer Portal.</p>
<p>For example, Canada has adopted OpenCerts, a platform/product built by
GovTech using blockchain technology that allows Singapore’s digital education
and training institutions to issue digital certificates to students upon
the completion of their course of study.</p>
