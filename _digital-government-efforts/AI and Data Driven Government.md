<h3>Driving the adoption of data science and AI to deliver citizen-centric government services</h3>
<p>Led by the Data Science and AI Division (DSAID), GovTech facilitates whole-of-government
(WOG) adoption of these technologies to enhance government services for
citizens.</p>
<p>DSAID utilizes data science and AI when collaborating with government
agencies to build in-house data science expertise, develop data strategies,
deploy AI and data services, and set up data infrastructures across the
government.</p>
<p>Expertise in this area enables GovTech to deliver citizen-centric government
services through data-driven insights and decision-making, ultimately improving
Singapore's digital government policy outcomes, service delivery and operational
efficiency.</p>
<h3>Serving citizens better through data-driven decision-making</h3>
<p>Citizen-derived data helps governments understand their citizens better,
facilitating citizen-oriented and data-driven decision making when creating
or improving government digital services. Understanding citizens’ preferences
also helps governments communicate more effectively with communities, fostering
stronger public-private collaborations in the process.</p>

<p>It is built on top of a Customer Data Platform that ingests a myriad of
data from across government systems, and then fed into deep machine-learning
models to identify the most relevant or personalised content for our users.</p>
<p>Through personalisation of government digital services, more effective
targeting and engagement strategies can be developed to achieve policy-based
outcomes.</p>

<p>GovTech’s Data Science and AI Division facilitates whole of government
adoption of data science and AI to deliver citizen-centric government services.</p>
<p>GovTech’s Data Science and AI Division (DSAID) was established as a capability
centre to formulate effective policies and deliver citizen-centric government
services through data-driven insights and decision-making. DSAID utilizes
data science and AI when collaborating with government agencies to build
in-house data science expertise, develop data strategies, deploy AI and
data services, and set up data infrastructures across the government.</p>
<p>This has improved Singapore’s digital government policy outcomes, service
delivery and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>In our current digital age, data will play an increasing role in government
digital transformation. Citizen-derived data helps governments understand
their citizens better, facilitating citizen-oriented and data-driven decision
making when creating or improving government digital services. Understanding
citizens’ preferences also helps governments communicate more effectively
with communities, fostering stronger public-private collaborations in the
process.</p>
<p>In addition to the effective use of data for service delivery and public
communications, data can also be used for government agencies to develop
policies to serve citizen and business needs.</p>
<h4><u>Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNPS)</u></h4>
<p>The Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP), a Strategic National Project,
provides whole-of-government products and services for collecting, sharing,
and analysing sensor data, as well as managing IoT and robotics systems.
SNSP is an integrated, nationwide platform that uses sensors to collect
essential data that can be evaluated to solve problems and support smart
solution making. Examples of sensors that are used by SNSP include smart
lampposts (Lamppost-as-a-Platform) for urban planning, smart water meters
for usage and leak tracking, computer vision-powered drowning alert systems,
and much more. These key metrics enable government agencies to gain insights
on user behaviours and tailor customised solutions to serve our citizens
and businesses better.</p>

as well.</p>
<p>To cultivate a data-driven community within the Government, the Agency
Champions of WOGAA (ACW) was launched in 2020. The programme started out
with a 71% uptake among government agencies and over 2,600 public officers
attended WOGAA events in FY20.</p>
