GovTech’s Data Science and AI Division facilitates whole of government adoption of data science and AI to deliver citizen-centric government services.

GovTech’s Data Science and AI Division (DSAID) was established as a capability centre to formulate effective policies and deliver citizen-centric government services through data-driven insights and decision-making. DSAID utilizes data science and AI when collaborating with government agencies to build in-house data science expertise, develop data strategies, deploy AI and data services, and set up data infrastructures across the government. 

This has improved Singapore’s digital government policy outcomes, service delivery and operational efficiency. 

In our current digital age, data will play an increasing role in government digital transformation. Citizen-derived data helps governments understand their citizens better, facilitating citizen-oriented and data-driven decision making when creating or improving government digital services. Understanding citizens’ preferences also helps governments communicate more effectively with communities, fostering stronger public-private collaborations in the process. 

In addition to the effective use of data for service delivery and public communications, data can also be used for government agencies to develop policies to serve citizen and business needs. 

## Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNPS)

The Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP), a Strategic National Project, provides whole-of-government products and services for collecting, sharing, and analysing sensor data, as well as managing IoT and robotics systems. SNSP is an integrated, nationwide platform that uses sensors to collect essential data that can be evaluated to solve problems and support smart solution making. Examples of sensors that are used by SNSP include smart lampposts (Lamppost-as-a-Platform) for urban planning, smart water meters for usage and leak tracking, computer vision-powered drowning alert systems, and much more. These key metrics enable government agencies to gain insights on user behaviours and tailor customised solutions to serve our citizens and businesses better.

## Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA)

WOGAA is an end-to-end website performance evaluation platform comprising a frontend citizen feedback interface and a backend dashboard for data analytics visualisation. It allows government officers to gain insights on the performance of government websites and digital services in real-time through a convenient and user-friendly platform. It also consolidates data points from across the whole-of-government (WOG) to allow agencies to benchmark the performance of their websites services, and have a holistic overview of government digital services. This helps government agencies to make effective data-driven decisions and proactively improve the performance of their citizen and business services, potentially leading to cost savings as well.

To cultivate a data-driven community within the Government, the Agency Champions of WOGAA (ACW) was launched in 2020. The programme started out with a 71% uptake among government agencies and over 2,600 public officers attended WOGAA events in FY20.

## Personalise 

[Personalise.gov.sg](https://personalise.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} is a whole-of-government personalisation engine that aims to customise digital touch points such as emails and websites to provide the most relevant services to our residents. The engine is built on top of a Customer Data Platform that ingests a myriad of data from across government systems, and then fed into deep machine-learning models to identify the most relevant or personalised content for our users.

Through personalisation of government digital services, more effective targeting and engagement strategies can be developed to achieve policy-based outcomes. This facilitates stronger government-citizen relationships and builds trust in the government.
