<h3>Innovation led by GovTech</h3>
<p>Led by the Data Science and AI Division (DSAID), GovTech facilitates whole-of-government
(WOG) adoption of these technologies to enhance government services for
citizens.</p>
<p>DSAID utilises data science and AI when collaborating with government
agencies to build in-house data science expertise, develop data strategies,
deploy AI and data services, and set up data infrastructures across the
government.</p>
<p>Expertise in this area enables GovTech to deliver citizen-centric government
services through data-driven insights and decision-making, ultimately improving
Singapore's digital government policy outcomes, service delivery and operational
efficiency.</p>
<h3>The importance of data-driven decision-making</h3>
<p>Citizen-derived data helps governments understand their citizens better
and make decisions catered to their experiences when creating or improving
government digital services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding citizens’ preferences also helps governments communicate
more effectively with communities, fostering stronger public-private collaborations
in the process.</p>

<p>WOGAA is an end-to-end website performance evaluation platform comprising
a front-end citizen feedback interface and a back-end dashboard for data
analytics visualisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It allows government officers to gain insights on the performance of government
websites and digital services in real-time through a convenient and user-friendly
platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also consolidates data points from across the whole-of-government (WOG)
to allow agencies to benchmark the performance of their website services,
and have a holistic overview of government digital services.</p>

digital touch points such as emails and websites to provide the most relevant
services to our residents.&nbsp;</p>

data from across government systems, and then fed into deep machine-learning
models to identify the most relevant or personalised content for our users.</p>

targeting and engagement strategies can be developed to achieve policy-based
outcomes.</p>
