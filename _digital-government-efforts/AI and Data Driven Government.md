<h3>Driving the adoption of data science and AI to deliver citizen-centric government services</h3>
<p>Led by the Data Science and AI Division (DSAID), GovTech facilitates whole-of-government
(WOG) adoption of these technologies to enhance government services for
citizens.</p>
<p>DSAID utilizes data science and AI when collaborating with government
agencies to build in-house data science expertise, develop data strategies,
deploy AI and data services, and set up data infrastructures across the
government.</p>
<p>Expertise in this area enables GovTech to deliver citizen-centric government
services through data-driven insights and decision-making, ultimately improving
Singapore's digital government policy outcomes, service delivery and operational
efficiency.</p>
<h3>Serving citizens better through data-driven decision-making</h3>
<p>Citizen-derived data helps governments understand their citizens better,
facilitating citizen-oriented and data-driven decision making when creating
or improving government digital services. Understanding citizensâ€™ preferences
also helps governments communicate more effectively with communities, fostering
stronger public-private collaborations in the process.</p>

digital touch points such as emails and websites to provide the most relevant
services to our residents.</p>
