<h3>Designing digital services for everyone</h3>
<p>We believe tech should be for everyone. We are committed to diversity
and inclusion as one of our <a href="/about-us/our-journey/our-focus-areas/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">key focus areas</a>, in all
areas of our work with external and internal stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes empowering vulnerable communities through tech, designing
inclusive interfaces and products, and creating an inclusive and diverse
tech community within GovTech and beyond.</p>
<p>Every year, Singapore’s government digital services undergo a round of
Usability Checks (UC) conducted by GovTech, via a Mystery Shopper concept.
Through the UCs, all digital services are rated against a set of criteria,
which includes accessibility requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scorecards of the digital services are then shared across the whole-of-government,
spurring agencies to uplift the standard of their digital services.</p>
<p>Below are a few ways we ensure the digital services developed across the
government are inclusive and accessible for everyone.</p>
<h3>Digital Service Standards (DSS)</h3>
<p>This helps government agencies implement digital services that meet the
Digital Government Blueprint’s (DGB) goal of delivering digital services
that are easy, seamless, and relevant for our citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>It consists of policies, standards, and guidelines for government agencies
to adhere to and fulfils a core need of Singapore’s Digital Government
Journey — to design and deliver unified and consistent government digital
services to citizens and businesses based on their user needs.</p>
<p>The design principles of the DSS include Intuitive Design and Usability,
Accessibility and Inclusivity, and Relevance and Consistency.</p>

<h4>Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)</h4>

</div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.designsystem.tech.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SGDS</a> ensures
that all government services are united by a common UI language and user
experience that is compliant to the DSS where applicable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is made up of UI components, patterns and templates that are oriented
towards citizen and business needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By following curated design guidelines to maximise user experiences, government
agencies that utilise the SGDS can transform their websites and deliver
high-quality digital services easily.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Purple A11y</h4>

</div>
<p>GovTech introduced this customisable, automated web accessibility-testing
tool that allows software development teams to find and fix accessibility
issues or gaps in their product/service.</p>
<p>In 2022, Purple HATS (now known as Purple A11y) was also registered as
a DigitalPublicGood by the <a href="https://www.undp.org/blog/why-singapore-building-digital-public-goods" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)</a> and
published as an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) case study for its impact as a Tech for Public Good.</p>

<h3>Driving diversity and inclusion within GovTech</h3>
<p>As we commit ourselves to developing inclusive and accessible products,
it is just as important to ensure we apply the same principles within the
organisation and among GovTechies as well.</p>
