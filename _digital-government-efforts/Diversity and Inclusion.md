<p><strong>Designing digital services for everyone </strong>
</p>
<p>- We believe tech should be for everyone. We are committed to diversity
and inclusion as one of our <u>key focus areas</u> (Link to "About Us - Our
Journey - Our Focus Areas" page), in all areas of our work with external
and internal stakeholders.</p>
<p>- This includes empowering vulnerable communities through tech, designing
inclusive interfaces and products, and creating an inclusive and diverse
tech community within GovTech and beyond.</p>
<p>- Every year, Singapore’s government digital services undergo a round
of Usability Checks (UC) conducted by GovTech, via a Mystery Shopper concept.
Through the UCs, all digital services are rated against a set of criteria,
which include its accessibility requirements. The scorecards of the digital
services are then shared across the whole-of-government, spurring agencies
to uplift the standard of their digital services.</p>
<p>- Below are a few ways we ensure the digital services developed across
the government are inclusive and accessible for everyone.</p>
<p><u>Digital Service Standards (DSS) </u>
</p>
<p>- This helps government agencies implement digital services that meet
the Digital Government Blueprint’s (DGB) goal of delivering digital services
that are easy, seamless, and relevant for our citizens and businesses</p>
<p>- It consists of policies, standards, and guidelines for government agencies
to adhere to and fulfils a core need of Singapore’s Digital Government
Journey — to design and deliver unified and consistent government digital
services to citizens and businesses based on their user needs. - The design
principles of the DSS include Intuitive Design and Usability, Accessibility
and Inclusivity, and Relevance and Consistency.</p>

<p><u>Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) </u>— The SGDS ensures that
all government services are united by a common UI language and user experience
that is compliant to the DSS where applicable.</p>
<p>- It is made up of UI components, patterns and templates that are oriented
towards citizen and business needs.</p>
<p>- By following curated design guidelines to maximise user experiences,
government agencies that utilise the SGDS can transform their websites
and deliver high-quality digital services easily. CTA: Learn more about

<p><u>Purple HATS </u>
</p>
<p>- To improve the accessibility of digital services across the government,
GovTech introduced this customisable, automated web accessibility-testing
tool that allows software development teams to find and fix accessibility
issues or gaps in their product/service.</p>
<p>- In 2022, Purple HATS was also registered as a DigitalPublicGood by the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and published as an Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) case study for its impact
as a Tech for Public Good.</p>

<p>- As we commit ourselves to developing inclusive and accessible products,
it is just as important to ensure we apply the same principles within the
organisation and among GovTechies as well. - An example is the Digital4Good
programme established in 2019 to empower underprivileged children/youths
and seniors by increasing their digital literacy. This is achieved by inculcating
skillsets such as programming, problem solving and critical thinking for
children/youth and the use of digital tools for seniors.</p>
<p>- In 2021, the Women in (Gov)Tech Employee Resource Group (ERG) was also
established to develop ground-up programmes and initiatives to support
the attraction, development, and retention of female talent within and
outside of GovTech. This is in alignment with GovTech’s commitment to the
SG Women in Tech Corporate Pledge.</p>
<p>- Recently, the GovTech’s Accessibility Enabling team was formed to understand
and design inclusive government services based on the unique perspectives
and usage patterns of persons with disabilities (PwDs) and seniors. The
team complements agile development methods and promotes the use of automated
accessibility testing in the product development process. This is achieved
through the provision of consultancy services, training sessions, distribution
of guides and playbooks, and outreach activities.</p>

<p>Every year, Singapore’s government digital services undergo a round of
Usability Checks (UC) conducted by GovTech, via a Mystery Shopper concept.
Through the UCs, all digital services are rated against a set of criteria,
which includes its accessibility requirements. The score cards of the digital
services are then shared across the whole-of-government, spurring agencies
to uplift the standard of their digital services.</p>
<p>Through these efforts, the satisfaction rating for our citizen and business
services have improved over the years. This is illustrated in the 2020
Satisfaction Survey for Government to Citizen (G2C) and Government to Business
(G2B) services where we achieved a score of 86% and 76% respectively. This
is a 7% increase in both scores compared to 2018’s survey results.</p>
<h2>Digital Service Standards (DSS)</h2>
<p>The DSS helps government agencies implement digital services that meet
the Digital Government Blueprint’s (DGB) goal of delivering digital services
that are easy, seamless, and relevant for our citizens and businesses.
It consists of policies, standards, and guidelines for government agencies
to adhere to and fulfills a core need of Singapore’s Digital Government
Journey – to design and deliver unified and consistent government digital
services to citizens and businesses based on their user needs. The design
principles of the DSS include Intuitive Design and Usability, Accessibility
and Inclusivity, and Relevance and Consistency. The DSS is developed based
on an iterative development approach through a cross-disciplinary team
(e.g. policy specialists, user experience experts etc); and benchmarked
against international standards to upkeep its quality and relevancy.</p>
<h2>Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)</h2>
<p>The SGDS ensures that all government services are united by a common UI
language and user experience that is compliant to the DSS where applicable.
It is made up of UI components, patterns and templates that are oriented
towards citizen and business needs. By following curated design guidelines
to maximise user experiences, government agencies that utilise the SGDS
can transform their websites and deliver high-quality digital services
easily. It also allows government agencies to standardize online service
interfaces and implement ready templates, patterns and UI components that
have already passed accessibility checks for time savings. This allows
agencies to focus on other areas of concerns such as the architecture and
security of government digital services.</p>
