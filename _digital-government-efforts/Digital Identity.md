Singapore’s National Digital Identity initiative (NDI) provides our citizens and businesses with more convenient and secure online transactions with both the government and private sector organisations. Underpinned by Singpass – Singapore’s trusted digital identity – the NDI brings together the Singpass app, Myinfo and Myinfo business to provide greater transactional security and ease of use.

Today, citizens can conveniently and easily access government and private sector services through Singpass – from accessing Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings, to renewing insurance policies and digitally signing documents. 

Singapore’s NDI has also expanded to include services such as Myinfo business and Corppass, acting as an international business gateway that allows global business transactions and the flow of cross border data and transactions in an open and trusted environment. 

On top of providing citizens with seamless and secure online experiences, we envision an NDI that will empower our private and public sectors to develop value-added services based on a common and universal trusted framework.

Today, Singpass has a user base of more than 4.2 million users and provides convenient and secure access to over 1,700 services by more than 460 government and private sector organisations. Singpass facilitates about 300 million personal and corporate transactions every year and serves approximately 97% of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 15 and above, making it one of the most pervasively adopted national digital identity systems in the world.

Governments around the world are driving digital transformation by empowering citizens with a digital identity. In Singapore, we do this through our National Digital Identity (NDI) initiative, which is a Strategic National Project under our Smart Nation vision. 

Digital identities comprise unique personal attributes and identifiers that allow for online verification of individuals without the need for manual or paper documentation. This enables citizens to access a diversity of government and private sector services seamlessly, quickly, and conveniently. It also provides citizens with ownership over their personal data as their explicit consent is required before their data can be used.  

By implementing national digital identities, governments can also streamline their administration processes and develop new communication channels with citizens. Additionally, by providing a trusted and secure transaction platform, government agencies are further encouraged to digitalise services to capture new opportunities and better serve citizens and residents. Finally, it also allows for government and private sector services to transcend organisational and geographical boundaries.  

## Singpass

Launched in 2003, Singpass is the cornerstone of Singapore’s NDI initiative. It is a personal authentication system that allows users to access government and business services online through a single login. This can be in the form of their fingerprint, facial recognition or a 6-digit passcode. Two-factor authentication (2FA) methods such as Singpass’ Face Verification and Multi-User SMS 2FA and a SMS one-time password (OTP) are also available to users. These provide additional security for users’ personal data and a diversity of user choices to best fit the needs of all citizens and residents

As of today, out of a population of 4.2 million citizens and residents in Singapore, more than 3.2 million of them are on the Singpass app. Through Singpass, users can access over 1,700 digital services across 460 government agencies and businesses. The Singpass API alone has over 18 million requests per month.  

Accessibility features like a dark mode and screen reader compatibility help the visually impaired to navigate the Singpass app effectively, ensuring that Singpass’ services are inclusive to cater to the needs of different user groups. Overseas Singaporeans can simply tap the Face Verification service to set up their Singpass app via a simple face scan. This circumvents the need for a physical PIN mailer or a SMS-OTP to set up the Singpass app.

Singpass is continually enhanced and updated through regular user testing and public feedback. GovTech also collaborates with the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s (IMDA) SG Digital Office to educate users who may need more assistance using Singpass.

## Myinfo

Myinfo is a personal data platform that allows citizens and permanent residents to pre-fill digital forms with their personal data without having to repeatedly key in the same information over multiple transactions. This allows individual management and ownership of personal data as users will have to grant consent for usage of their data. It also results in higher data quality as information is retrieved from government databases instead of manual entries which are prone to human error, facilitating “instant” approvals, saving time, and increasing the efficiency of online transactions. By retrieving data from various government sources directly, Myinfo enables businesses to complete the “Know-Your-Customer” (KYC) process without requesting for additional verification documents from customers. This creates a seamless digital experience with instant provisioning of services, where possible, for customers and businesses. 

Currently, over 700 digital services from the government and private sector are integrated with Myinfo. Businesses have also reported an 80% adoption by eligible customers, with an 80% reduction in transaction time due to instant verification and reduction of manual work. A 20% increase in transaction completion due to better UX and a 15% increase in approvals due to better data quality were also reported.

## Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex)

SGFinDex is the first public digital infrastructure globally to utilise NDI and a centrally managed online consent system to enable users to access their financial information on a single platform even if it is held across different government agencies and financial institutions. Built on Singpass, it was developed via a public-private collaboration between the Singapore government, The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), 7 participating banks and the SGX Central Depository (CDP).

Through SGFinDex, individuals can better manage their finances and retrieve personal financial information such as deposits, credit cards, loans, and investments seamlessly, securely, and conveniently. Users can also look forward to being able to access information on their insurance policies through SGFinDex.

Since its public release on 7 December 2020, SGFinDex has boasted over 150,000 unique sign ups, with 290,000 bank accounts linked to it and 620,000 data retrievals made.

The acceleration of digital transformation within Singapore’s business environment has prompted the Government to develop business-centric and trusted services that enhance corporate digital transactions. This has given rise to Singapore’s Corporate Digital Identity (CDI) platform, which comprises government digital services that facilitate G2B, B2B, and B2C transactions, and are safe and convenient for businesses to adopt. 

A single corporate digital identity for business users, similar to an individual’s personal identity, is a business’ unique digital attribute that is used to verify its identity during online transactions. For businesses, a corporate digital identity allows for secure and reliable transactions with government agencies, customers, and other businesses without the need for physical verification and tedious administrative processes such as form filling.  

## Corppass

Corppass is an authorisation system used by over 550,000 participating businesses, non-profit organisations and associations to manage the digital service access of their employees and conduct corporate transactions digitally in a secure manner. With Corppass, businesses can transact with government agencies online for over 250 digital services such as applying for trade licenses and businesses grants, the filing of corporate taxes, and much more! 

Business users leveraging Corppass benefit from utilising a single platform to grant and manage the corporate access given to their employees for digital services that the business engages in. The diversity of Corppass roles that businesses can grant employees allows employees to conduct specialised and separate transactions on behalf of the business such as filing of corporate tax, application for permits and licenses. At the same time, business owners enjoy greater control and visibility of these transactions.

Corppass is aligned to Singapore’s Smart Nation objectives and the Government's aim to create secure and reliable digital services for citizens and businesses.

## Myinfo business

Myinfo business is a service that enables businesses to consent to the sharing of their corporate and applicants’ personal data securely with other participating businesses for more seamless digital transactions. 

Through Myinfo business, business users can pre-fill digital forms with entity data from government sources, such as a company’s corporate profile, financial performance, and ownership information, for simpler online transactions including opening corporate utility accounts or applying for business loans online. This has resulted in less repetitive form filling, a lower incidence of mistakes arising from human error, and a reduced need for physical verification of supporting documentation for online transactions. 

Myinfo business has powered over 190 digital services, facilitated an average of over 500,000 monthly transactions for the public and private sectors and serviced more than 120 Government-to-Business (G2B) digital services. Currently, more than 60 private sector digital services have been onboarded to Myinfo business.
