<h3>Singapore’s trusted digital identity</h3>
<p>The National Digital Identity (NDI) is Singapore’s trusted digital identity.
Underpinned by Singpass, the NDI brings together the Singpass app, Myinfo
and Myinfo business to provide greater transactional security and ease
of use.</p>
<p>Today, citizens can conveniently and easily access government and private
sector services through Singpass – from accessing Central Provident Fund
(CPF) savings to renewing insurance policies and digitally signing documents.</p>
<p>Singapore’s NDI has also expanded to include services such as Myinfo business
and Corppass, acting as an international business gateway that allows global
business transactions and the flow of cross-border data and transactions
in an open and trusted environment.</p>

<h3>National Digital Identity for Citizens</h3>
<p>This enables citizens to access a diversity of government and private
sector services seamlessly, quickly, and conveniently. It also provides
citizens with ownership over their personal data as their explicit consent
is required before their data can be used.</p>

<h3>Corporate Digital Identity for businesses</h3>
<p>A single corporate digital identity for business users, similar to an
individual’s personal identity, is a business’ unique digital attribute
that is used to verify its identity during online transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For businesses, a corporate digital identity allows for secure and reliable
transactions with government agencies, customers, and other businesses
without the need for physical verification and tedious administrative processes.</p>
