<p>Singapore’s National Digital Identity initiative (NDI) provides our citizens
and businesses with more convenient and secure online transactions with
both the government and private sector organisations. Underpinned by Singpass
– Singapore’s trusted digital identity – the NDI brings together the Singpass
app, Myinfo and Myinfo business to provide greater transactional security
and ease of use.</p>
<p>Today, citizens can conveniently and easily access government and private

<p>Today, Singpass has a user base of more than 4.2 million users and provides
convenient and secure access to over 1,700 services by more than 460 government
and private sector organisations. Singpass facilitates about 300 million

<hr>
<p>Governments around the world are driving digital transformation by empowering
citizens with a digital identity. In Singapore, we do this through our
National Digital Identity (NDI) initiative, which is a Strategic National
Project under our Smart Nation vision.</p>
<p>Digital identities comprise unique personal attributes and identifiers
that allow for online verification of individuals without the need for
manual or paper documentation. This enables citizens to access a diversity
of government and private sector services seamlessly, quickly, and conveniently.
It also provides citizens with ownership over their personal data as their
explicit consent is required before their data can be used.</p>
<p>By implementing national digital identities, governments can also streamline
their administration processes and develop new communication channels with
citizens. Additionally, by providing a trusted and secure transaction platform,
government agencies are further encouraged to digitalise services to capture
new opportunities and better serve citizens and residents. Finally, it
also allows for government and private sector services to transcend organisational
and geographical boundaries.</p>
<h2>Singpass</h2>
<p>Launched in 2003, Singpass is the cornerstone of Singapore’s NDI initiative.
It is a personal authentication system that allows users to access government
and business services online through a single login. This can be in the
form of their fingerprint, facial recognition or a 6-digit passcode. Two-factor
authentication (2FA) methods such as Singpass’ Face Verification and Multi-User
SMS 2FA and a SMS one-time password (OTP) are also available to users.
These provide additional security for users’ personal data and a diversity
of user choices to best fit the needs of all citizens and residents</p>
<p>As of today, out of a population of 4.2 million citizens and residents
in Singapore, more than 3.2 million of them are on the Singpass app. Through
Singpass, users can access over 1,700 digital services across 460 government
agencies and businesses. The Singpass API alone has over 18 million requests
per month.</p>
<p>Accessibility features like a dark mode and screen reader compatibility
help the visually impaired to navigate the Singpass app effectively, ensuring
that Singpass’ services are inclusive to cater to the needs of different
user groups. Overseas Singaporeans can simply tap the Face Verification
service to set up their Singpass app via a simple face scan. This circumvents
the need for a physical PIN mailer or a SMS-OTP to set up the Singpass
app.</p>
<p>Singpass is continually enhanced and updated through regular user testing
and public feedback. GovTech also collaborates with the Infocomm Media
Development Authority’s (IMDA) SG Digital Office to educate users who may
need more assistance using Singpass.</p>

<h2>Myinfo</h2>
<p>Myinfo is a personal data platform that allows citizens and permanent
residents to pre-fill digital forms with their personal data without having
to repeatedly key in the same information over multiple transactions. This
allows individual management and ownership of personal data as users will
have to grant consent for usage of their data. It also results in higher
data quality as information is retrieved from government databases instead
of manual entries which are prone to human error, facilitating “instant”
approvals, saving time, and increasing the efficiency of online transactions.
By retrieving data from various government sources directly, Myinfo enables
businesses to complete the “Know-Your-Customer” (KYC) process without requesting
for additional verification documents from customers. This creates a seamless
digital experience with instant provisioning of services, where possible,
for customers and businesses.</p>
<p>Currently, over 700 digital services from the government and private sector
are integrated with Myinfo. Businesses have also reported an 80% adoption
by eligible customers, with an 80% reduction in transaction time due to
instant verification and reduction of manual work. A 20% increase in transaction
completion due to better UX and a 15% increase in approvals due to better
data quality were also reported.</p>

<h2>Singapore Financial Data Exchange (SGFinDex)</h2>
<p>SGFinDex is the first public digital infrastructure globally to utilise
NDI and a centrally managed online consent system to enable users to access
their financial information on a single platform even if it is held across
different government agencies and financial institutions. Built on Singpass,
it was developed via a public-private collaboration between the Singapore
government, The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), 7 participating
banks and the SGX Central Depository (CDP).</p>
<p>Through SGFinDex, individuals can better manage their finances and retrieve
personal financial information such as deposits, credit cards, loans, and
investments seamlessly, securely, and conveniently. Users can also look
forward to being able to access information on their insurance policies
through SGFinDex.</p>
<p>Since its public release on 7 December 2020, SGFinDex has boasted over
150,000 unique sign ups, with 290,000 bank accounts linked to it and 620,000
data retrievals made.</p>

<p>The acceleration of digital transformation within Singapore’s business
environment has prompted the Government to develop business-centric and
trusted services that enhance corporate digital transactions. This has
given rise to Singapore’s Corporate Digital Identity (CDI) platform, which
comprises government digital services that facilitate G2B, B2B, and B2C
transactions, and are safe and convenient for businesses to adopt.</p>
<p>A single corporate digital identity for business users, similar to an
individual’s personal identity, is a business’ unique digital attribute
that is used to verify its identity during online transactions. For businesses,
a corporate digital identity allows for secure and reliable transactions
with government agencies, customers, and other businesses without the need
for physical verification and tedious administrative processes such as
form filling.</p>
<h2>Corppass</h2>
<p>Corppass is an authorisation system used by over 550,000 participating
businesses, non-profit organisations and associations to manage the digital
service access of their employees and conduct corporate transactions digitally
in a secure manner. With Corppass, businesses can transact with government
agencies online for over 250 digital services such as applying for trade
licenses and businesses grants, the filing of corporate taxes, and much
more!</p>
<p>Business users leveraging Corppass benefit from utilising a single platform
to grant and manage the corporate access given to their employees for digital
services that the business engages in. The diversity of Corppass roles
that businesses can grant employees allows employees to conduct specialised
and separate transactions on behalf of the business such as filing of corporate
tax, application for permits and licenses. At the same time, business owners
enjoy greater control and visibility of these transactions.</p>
<p>Corppass is aligned to Singapore’s Smart Nation objectives and the Government's
aim to create secure and reliable digital services for citizens and businesses.</p>
<h2>Myinfo business</h2>
<p>Myinfo business is a service that enables businesses to consent to the
sharing of their corporate and applicants’ personal data securely with
other participating businesses for more seamless digital transactions.</p>
<p>Through Myinfo business, business users can pre-fill digital forms with
entity data from government sources, such as a company’s corporate profile,
financial performance, and ownership information, for simpler online transactions
including opening corporate utility accounts or applying for business loans
online. This has resulted in less repetitive form filling, a lower incidence
of mistakes arising from human error, and a reduced need for physical verification
of supporting documentation for online transactions.</p>
<p>Myinfo business has powered over 190 digital services, facilitated an
average of over 500,000 monthly transactions for the public and private
sectors and serviced more than 120 Government-to-Business (G2B) digital
