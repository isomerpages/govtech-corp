<h3>Providing citizens and businesses a more convenient, secure and streamlined way to transact</h3>
<p>Underpinned by Singpass — Singapore’s trusted digital identity — the National
Digital Identity (NDI) initiative brings together the Singpass app, Myinfo
and Myinfo business to provide greater transactional security and ease
of use.</p>
<p>Today, citizens can conveniently and easily access government and private
sector services through Singpass – from accessing Central Provident Fund
(CPF) savings, to renewing insurance policies and digitally signing documents.</p>
<p>Singapore’s NDI has also expanded to include services such as Myinfo business
and Corppass, acting as an international business gateway that allows global
business transactions and the flow of cross-border data and transactions
in an open and trusted environment.</p>
<h3>National Digital Identity for Citizens</h3>
<p>This enables citizens to access a diversity of government and private
sector services seamlessly, quickly, and conveniently. It also provides
citizens with ownership over their personal data as their explicit consent
is required before their data can be used.</p>
<h4><u>Singpass</u></h4>

<p>Launched in 2003, Singpass is the cornerstone of Singapore’s NDI initiative.
It is a personal authentication system that allows users to access government
and business services online through a single login. This can be in the
form of their fingerprint, facial recognition or a 6-digit passcode.</p>
<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) methods such as Singpass’ Face Verification
and Multi-User SMS 2FA and a SMS one-time password (OTP) are also available
to users. These provide additional security for users’ personal data and
a diversity of user choices to best fit the needs of all citizens and residents.</p>

<h3>Corporate Digital Identity for Businesses</h3>
<p>A single corporate digital identity for business users, similar to an
individual’s personal identity, is a business’ unique digital attribute
that is used to verify its identity during online transactions.</p>
<p>For businesses, a corporate digital identity allows for secure and reliable
transactions with government agencies, customers, and other businesses
without the need for physical verification and tedious administrative processes.</p>
<h4><u>Corppass</u></h4>
