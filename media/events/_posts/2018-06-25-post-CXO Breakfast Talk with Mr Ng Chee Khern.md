<p>Smart Nation is about leveraging technology to improve the lives of citizens
and businesses and create opportunities for a better future. It will involve
a significant transformation in our economy, government and also in our
society. In support of Smart Nation, Singapore is making a big push for
digital transformation in Government, to better harness technology for
policy and governance, and to build digital services that meet the needs
of citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>This will involve a more concerted effort to push for digital transformation
within every Ministry and agency, relooking at how the Government organises
itself to provide services, building new platforms and capabilities, and
making greater use of data.</p>
<p>In this session, Mr Ng will share what role can the industry play in supporting
these efforts and what are some of the opportunities for the industry to
work more closely with the Government.</p>
