Smart Nation is about leveraging technology to improve the lives of citizens and businesses, and create opportunities for a better future. It will involve significant transformation in our economy, government and also in our society. In support of Smart Nation, Singapore is making a big push for digital transformation in Government, to better harness technology for policy and governance, and to build digital services that meet the needs of citizens and businesses. 

This will involve a more concerted effort to push for digital transformation within every Ministry and agency, relooking at how the Government organises itself to provide services, building new platforms and capabilities, and making greater use of data.

In this session, Mr Ng will share what role can the industry play in supporting these efforts and what are some of the opportunities for industry to work more closely with the Government.
