In 2025, we envision a Singapore transformed for the better by infocomm media. It will be a nation where people live meaningful and fulfilled lives enabled by technology, and where there are exciting opportunities for all. It will be a place where infocomm media enables a better quality of life for our people through world-class connectivity, compelling local content, and technologies to make everyday lives smoother and more convenient. It will be a living lab to entrepreneurs, growth companies and multinationals in the infocomm media space where they continually experiment and innovate to contribute to sustainable and quality economic growth.

To realise these desired outcomes, Infocomm Media 2025 sets out to create a globally competitive infocomm media ecosystem that enables and complements Singaporeâ€™s Smart Nation vision. This ecosystem supports our people and enterprises in tapping on infocomm media to effect economic and social transformation, and to create enriching and compelling content to help bind our communities and foster a common identity.
