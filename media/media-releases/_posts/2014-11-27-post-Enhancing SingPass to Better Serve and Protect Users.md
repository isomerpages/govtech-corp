<h3>The SingPass system&nbsp;is reviewed&nbsp;regularly, and security enhancements are ongoing measures to deliver a secure SingPass service and help users better protect their SingPass accounts and personal information.</h3>
<p>Launched in March 2003, SingPass is a gateway to more than 350 e-services
and has seen the following enhancements:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Prompts to change passwords to stronger ones every two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After any failed login attempt, users will&nbsp;be asked&nbsp;to key in
a randomly generated security code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any changes made to the account holder's&nbsp;key&nbsp;personal information
will trigger a notification letter to be sent to the user to verify this
change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resetting of passwords</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Resetting passwords, one of the most common protective measures in place,
is done when unusual activities&nbsp;are detected&nbsp;on the SingPass
accounts or if they have been inactive for three years.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is
a&nbsp;common&nbsp;industry practice and does not mean that the accounts
have been misused or compromised.</p>
<p>Notification letters are currently being sent out to inform users of inactive
accounts about&nbsp;the resetting of&nbsp;their passwords and how&nbsp;they
can proceed to request for&nbsp;new passwords.&nbsp;These users&nbsp;are
given&nbsp;a 14-day grace period to change their passwords before their
accounts are deactivated.</p>
<p>"We continue to strengthen the SingPass system to protect users and enable
them to transact safely online when using SingPass. We monitor all SingPass
accounts regularly and deactivate dormant accounts to ensure that citizens
who are not using their accounts are not unnecessarily exposed. Similarly,
when accounts&nbsp;are found&nbsp;to have unusual activities, we will reset
the passwords immediately. These are common&nbsp;precautionary&nbsp;measures
adopted by industry to protect online users," said Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Assistant
Chief Executive&nbsp;GCIO,&nbsp;of the Infocomm Development Authority of
Singapore.</p>
<p>Given our continued efforts to improve the SingPass system, the Government
will&nbsp;be implementing Two Factor Authentication&nbsp;(2FA) for e-government
transactions, particularly&nbsp;for&nbsp;those involving sensitive data.
This&nbsp;could be a one-time "second-factor" password delivered through
a token (hardware or software) or via a Short Messaging Service (SMS).</p>
<p>Users are also urged&nbsp;to take the necessary precautionary measures&nbsp;to
strengthen their passwords.&nbsp;The public can visit the Go Safe Online
