<p>The Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) announced the
signing of a Memorandum of Intent (MOI) with the National University of
Singapore (NUS) today. GovTech and NUS will collaborate in the areas of
technological innovation, specifically manpower and capability development
for the benefit of public sector agencies.</p>
<h3>Enhancing Technological Capabilities of Public Officers and Students</h3>
<p>The two parties will use their respective resources and expertise to enhance
the technological capabilities and competencies of public officers and
NUS students in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge sharing to co-create solutions</strong> ‚Äì GovTech will
share its experience and insight on technological innovation gained from
public sector projects. NUS will also share insight from their own projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deepen data science capabilities</strong> ‚Äì NUS will provide data
science training to at least 2,000 public officers annually under this
MOI. This looks to improve public officers‚Äô knowledge and understanding
of data science to address challenges faced by the public sector. NUS will
also help to provide technology expertise and access to professional services
required for such training sessions. In addition, GovTech and NUS will
identify a data science project to collaborate on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-creation of solutions</strong> ‚Äì GovTech and NUS will co-create
innovative solutions to challenges faced by the public sector, particularly
in cyber security, artificial intelligence, and data science. NUS will
also work with GovTech to develop methods and processes to strengthen cyber
security for public agencies. GovTech and NUS will also form a GovTech-NUS
Exchange Programme for personnel to be exchanged and attached to each other‚Äôs
organisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training of students</strong> ‚Äì GovTech and NUS will explore various
collaboration modes (e.g. internships, final year projects, challenges
and hackathons) to develop NUS students and equip them with the right skills
to succeed in the future workforce.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These initiatives aim to complement the recent Committee on the Future
Economy recommendations for public officers to pick up skills and innovative
thinking methods in order to achieve a well-coordinated, technology-enabled
and future-ready public service.</p>
<h3>Forging Partnerships and Encouraging Innovation</h3>
<p>This strategic partnership with NUS is the latest of many that GovTech
has formed, and will continue to forge in the future. The most recent tie-up
in February saw GovTech put pen to paper on agreements with eight IHLs.
GovTech is pleased to welcome NUS to its ever-growing stable of partners.</p>
<p>Ms Jacqueline Poh, Chief Executive, GovTech, said, ‚ÄúIncreased adoption
of data science in the public sector will transform the way that the Government
delivers services to the public. We are glad to partner NUS, which will
help us put this tool into the hands of 10,000 public officers over the
next five years, and educate them to use it effectively. This will help
us improve and quicken our efforts in building Singapore into a Smart Nation.
We look forward to working with more parties to make this happen.‚Äù</p>
<p>Professor Tan Eng Chye, Deputy President (Academic Affairs) and Provost,
National University of Singapore, said, ‚ÄúNUS is pleased that our strong
expertise in cyber security, artificial intelligence and data science will
help to accelerate the realisation of Singapore‚Äôs Smart Nation vision.
Our exciting collaboration with GovTech will train the country‚Äôs public
officers in the meaningful interpretation and use of big data, and enable
a broad and deep exchange of ideas and talent. This new partnership will
deepen the technological capabilities of public sector agencies, and be
the springboard for co-created innovative solutions to pressing issues
of national concern.‚Äù</p>
