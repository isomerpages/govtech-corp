<h3>Faster transportation, a one-stop portal for personal health information, and saving lives are just some of the new services&nbsp;being&nbsp;developed&nbsp;by the dynamic data science and analytics team at the IDA Hive.</h3>
<p>Located at the&nbsp;newly-opened&nbsp;Sandcrawler, the IDA Hive is home
to the Government Digital Services team made up of almost 100 data scientists,
designers, engineers, coders and other experts giving government services
and applications a tech makeover to better meet the&nbsp;needs of the public.</p>
<p>The IDA Hive includes a Design Experience Lab, fitted with a range of
sensor technology to assess user experience, facilities to chart the progress
of the services developed and even dashboards that provide engagement,
performance and stability indices of digital services.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople are at the heart of a Smart Nation. The government needs to ensure
that the digital experiences it delivers to citizens are useful, relevant
and easy enough for anyone to use, regardless of their level of tech-savviness.
One way to do that is to harness the power of data analytics&nbsp;to better
understand&nbsp;how to design policies and services that benefit people.
The Hive brings together, for the first time, a multi-disciplinary team
dedicated to public impact through technology. It enables the government
to be&nbsp;nimble&nbsp;and responsive in developing digital services and
policies. It also reflects the government‚Äôs commitment to strengthen its
capabilities in coming up with solutions that can make a difference in
improving people‚Äôs lives,‚Äù said Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Minister for Communications
and Information, at the official opening of the Hive by IDA.</p>
<p>Aimed at leveraging&nbsp;on&nbsp;data and analytics to gain better insights
into&nbsp;the needs of users to&nbsp;improve their digital government transaction
experience, the unit also doubles up as a consultancy, assisting agencies&nbsp;on
the development of&nbsp;new services or&nbsp;enhancement of&nbsp;existing
ones.</p>
<p>At the launch, Ms Jacqueline Poh, Managing Director, IDA, revealed the
revamped <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/files/media/media-releases/2015/10/IDA%20Hive%20Factsheetpdf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Data.gov.sg</a> portal.
This open data site revamp is a shift towards making data more accessible
and communicating more effectively with data. The new site&nbsp;places
heavy emphasis on&nbsp;data visualisations to allow users to understand
the data at a glance&nbsp;and has&nbsp;a data blog for data narratives
and stories that&nbsp;will be added&nbsp;over time. The <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/files/media/media-releases/2015/10/IDA%20Hive%20Factsheetpdf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">data.gov.sg</a> team
will also be focusing on improving data quality and releasing more data
streams (or APIs) to enable software application development on top of
the data.</p>
<p>She also shared that a new web and mobile analytics tool was&nbsp;being
developed&nbsp;to help agencies analyse browsing patterns from Government
websites and mobile apps to improve their user experience.</p>
<p>To support the various citizen-centric initiatives, Mr Chan Cheow Hoe,
Government CIO of Singapore, said, ‚ÄúThe talent, skills and experience required
to use data effectively and build applications to address the needs of
citizens has taken on a new dimension. There is a rising demand for experts
in this area within the government to take public service delivery to a
level higher and pave the way for how the government addresses real-life
problems and makes a difference in citizens‚Äô lives.‚Äù</p>
<p>In order to&nbsp;enhance&nbsp;government engineering and development capabilities,
IDA launched a new Technology Associates Programme that would provide talented
software developers, designers, data scientists,&nbsp;and others&nbsp;with
opportunities to apply technology to real public policy challenges at IDA
Hive.</p>
