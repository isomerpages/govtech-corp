**Third Government Bug Bounty Programme offers bonus payouts for mobile applications**<br>
*Bug bounty hunters will receive US$500 special bonus for validated vulnerabilities in mobile apps*

The Government Technology Agency (GovTech), supported by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), will be conducting the third Government Bug Bounty Programme (BBP) from 18 November to 8 December 2019.

The third Government BBP, which runs for three weeks, will be expanded to cover 12 Internet-facing government ICT systems, digital services and mobile applications with high user touchpoints: ACRA-on-the-GO Mobile and Bizfile (ACRA); eFocus and iWitness (MHA); HealthHub (HPB); LTA Website and MyTransport Mobile (LTA); MyEnv Mobile (NEA); MyTax Portal (IRAS); OneService Mobile (MND); SingStat Website and SingStat Mobile App (MTI-DOS).

Similar to the first two Government BBPs, only ethical hackers who have registered with the appointed bug bounty company, HackerOne, will be allowed to participate in this programme. Rewards can range from US$250 to US$10,000 depending on the severity of the discovered vulnerability. A special bonus of US$500 will be awarded for validated mobile vulnerabilities in the third Government BBP due to the increased complexities involved in the process.

Discovered vulnerabilities will be reported to the relevant organisations for remediation. GovTech will share the key findings by February 2020.

The BBP is part of the Government’s ongoing efforts to work with the cybersecurity community and industry to strengthen and safeguard government ICT systems and digital services. It complements the conventional methods of vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, enabling the Government to benchmark its defences against the global and local community of researchers and white hats. The first two Government BBPs covered 14 government systems and involved some 700 cybersecurity researchers and white hats, with a total bounty of close to US$38,000 paid out. 

To supplement the BBP, which is time bound and limited to a fixed set of systems and services, GovTech launched the [Vulnerability Disclosure Programme](https://www.tech.gov.sg/report_vulnerability) on 1 October 2019 to encourage the public’s responsible reporting of any suspected vulnerability found in government Internet-facing web-based and mobile applications.

These collaborations with the cybersecurity community-at-large have helped the Government discover vulnerabilities that would otherwise be undetected, and strengthen the security posture of our ICT systems and digital services.
