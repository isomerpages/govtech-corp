<h3>Tenders Called for Government ICT Infrastructure Services</h3>
<p>The Singapore Government is calling a series of tenders for the provision
of government infrastructure services in order to provide for a smooth
transition before the end of the current Standard ICT Operating Environment
(SOE) contract.</p>
<p>Launched in 2008, the objective of SOE was to consolidate the Government’s
infocomm services into a single environment. To date, 75,000 suites have
been deployed to 96 government agencies. The SOE contract will expire in
February 2016. As such, there is a need to put new contracts in place to
ensure service continuity.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to operate in a single environment to enhance
Whole-of-Government security, interoperability and resiliency. However,
having gathered feedback from the agencies and taking into consideration
their needs in the years to come, the new tenders are structured to allow
greater flexibility so that agencies have more options to manage their
IT infrastructure for optimal efficiency.</p>
<p>The new tenders will amongst other things cover the development, upgrading
of operations and maintenance of services such as Email &amp; Collaboration,
PCs and printers that are currently available in SOE.</p>
<h4>The first set of tenders will cover the following areas:</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Central core infrastructure services</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This tender will seek providers to deliver, migrate and operate (with
maintenance support) the IT infrastructure within the Data Centres in order
to provide the base IT building blocks required for other internal end
users facing IT services (such as email and collaboration services, remote
access services) to leverage on.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Messaging and collaboration services</strong> 
</p>

<p>This tender is for messaging and collaboration services to the Government

<p><strong>Agency Facilities Management (AFM)</strong> 
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This tender is for the supply of AFM support services to the Government

IT operations support.</p>
