<p>Singapore, 14 Aug 2024</p>
<p>84 scholarships were awarded today by the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information (MDDI), and its statutory boards and agencies - Cyber Security
Agency of Singapore (CSA), Government Technology Agency (GovTech), Infocomm
Media Development Authority (IMDA), and National Library Board (NLB). The
scholarship award ceremony was hosted by Mrs Josephine Teo, the Minister
for Digital Development and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart
Nation and Cybersecurity. This is MDDI family’s first scholarship award
ceremony following the merger of the Ministry of Communications and Information
and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group last October.</p>
<p>The scholarships are part of MDDI family’s collective effort to nurture
talents in technology, media, library, and archives services and communications
areas, allowing them to lead a range of digital development and government
communications work across public and private sectors. A total of three
types of scholarship were awarded to the recipients:</p>
<h3>(A) Undergraduate Scholarships</h3>
<p>The MDDI Family offers three categories of scholarships to support students
pursuing bachelor’s degrees relevant to the ministry, statutory boards,
or agencies:</p>
<h4>i. MDDI Information Service Scholarship</h4>
<p>3 recipients were awarded the MDDI Information Service Scholarship. This
scholarship was first introduced in 2008 to attract young talents with
an interest in government communications. They will play an important role
in public communications to ensure that citizens are heard and connected
to the Government, through engaging citizens on national and social issues
in various channels, strengthening policy communications at whole-of-government
level, communicating policies to the public, and managing government media
relations.</p>
<h4>ii. NLB Scholarship&nbsp;</h4>
<p>3 recipients were awarded the NLB Scholarship. Through the NLB Scholarship,
NLB aims to build and nurture a multi-disciplinary talent pipeline in information
literacy, knowledge creation and preservation to develop Singapore’s libraries
and archives of the future. These scholarship holders will play a key role
in realising NLB’s goal of transforming the reading and learning experience
for all Singaporeans. They will also contribute to NLB’s roles in building
a Learning Marketplace, nurturing an Informed Citizenry, inspiring Singapore
Storytellers, and being an Equaliser as envisioned through LAB25 (Libraries
and Archives Blueprint 2025).</p>
<h4>iii. Smart Nation Scholarship</h4>
<p>8 recipients were awarded the Smart Nation Scholarship (SNS). The SNS
seeks to develop future technology leaders who are passionate in making
a difference to our national digital transformation. Jointly offered by
CSA, GovTech, and IMDA, scholars can look forward to a multifaceted career,
specialising in a variety of tech domains and opportunities for job rotations
across the different public agencies.</p>
<h3>(B) MDDI Postgraduate Scholarship</h3>
<p>Beyond attracting and growing young talents, MDDI family also strives
to develop in-service officers’ professional and specialised capabilities
through the MDDI Postgraduate Scholarship, which was awarded to 2 MDDI
officers this year, to pursue postgraduate studies.</p>
<h3>(C) IMDA SG Digital Scholarship</h3>
<p>In addition to developing talents for the public sector, MDDI family also
aims to develop future leaders for Singapore’s technology and media ecosystem.
68 recipients were awarded the IMDA SG Digital Scholarship, an industry
scholarship that provides both undergraduate and postgraduate scholars
the flexibility to chart their own career with the industry and take on
key roles in a tech or media-related field in an organisation of their
choice. Recipients will also be supported for certifications beyond school
curriculum, overseas programmes, internship, mentorship, and networking
opportunities with industry leaders, to equip them with necessary skills
to ride on opportunities for a career in tech.</p>
<p>These scholars will join the growing community of Singaporean digital
leaders under IMDA’s SG Digital Leadership Accelerator programme, which
comprises over 1,000 tech and media talents, including past scholars who
hold leadership positions, such as founders of high-growth tech startups,
leaders in multi-national companies, and innovators building tech products
for the world, in areas ranging from AI to quantum. The past scholars also
pay it forward and mentor the younger SG Digital scholars.</p>
<p>The scholarship attracts high quality applicants with many focusing on
in-demand skills such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Cybersecurity,
Data Science and Analytics. For instance, 33 scholars will pursue AI-related
degrees to equip them with the relevant knowledge and skills to develop
and scale the use of AI for organisations and across the economy. This
is part of IMDA’s $20 million investment over three years to increase the
number of AI-related scholarships and overseas internships to grow the
talent pool. These efforts will contribute to Singapore’s goal of tripling
the AI workforce to 15,000 practitioners, under Singapore’s National AI
Strategy 2.0.</p>
