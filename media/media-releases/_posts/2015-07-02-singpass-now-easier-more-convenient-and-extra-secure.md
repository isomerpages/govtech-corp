From 5 July 2015 onwards, SingPass users can look forward to an improved user interface, mobile-friendly features and stronger security capabilities with the enhanced system.

The SingPass system has been enhanced to be easier and more convenient to use, with clearer instructions and more intuitive account management features, among other improvements. Users can better navigate the site and complete their tasks efficiently, access their account via mobile and update their SingPass account easily online, anytime, anywhere.

In addition to improved usability features, security is a critical component to the design of the enhanced system. Users will be able to receive SMS or email notifications for any changes made to their profile, so that they are always updated of their account activities. They will also go through a secure 2-step login process for e-government transactions involving sensitive data, such as financial or health information, or those that require high level of identity assurance. These measures help to ensure that users’ personal data is better protected. For a start, more than 100 government e-services will require 2-step verification. These include the more commonly-used e-services provided by MOM, CPFB and IRAS.

After the launch of the service on 5 July 2015, users will need to:
1. **Update their SingPass account** by providing and verifying their mobile number and email address, as well as setting up their security questions and answers.
2. **Set up their 2-step verification** by registering, activating and linking their OneKey token or mobile number to their SingPass account.
“Over the years, the Government has put over 200 e-services online through SingPass in order to enable swift and convenient transactions with the Government. With the rise of cyber threats in Singapore and globally, we have added security measures like multi-factor authentication to protect SingPass users' personal data. We urge all users to avoid using the same passwords for different purposes and to avoid sharing their account information with others,” said Ms Jacqueline Poh, Managing Director of the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore.
