<h3>Government Big Bounty Programme</h3>
<p>The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and Cyber Security Agency (CSA)
of Singapore will partner with local and overseas hackers on a Government
Bug Bounty Programme (GBBP) from December 2018 to January 2019.</p>
<p>Under the GBBP, ‘white hat’ hackers&nbsp;–&nbsp;or ethical hackers&nbsp;–&nbsp;will
be invited to search for and uncover vulnerabilities in ICT systems,&nbsp;where&nbsp;they
will receive monetary rewards in return. Rewards can range from US$250
to US$10,000 depending on the severity of the ‘bug’ discovered by registered/authorised
hackers.&nbsp;Discovered ‘bugs’ will be reported to the organisation for
remediation.</p>
<p>The GBBP will run over&nbsp;a period of three weeks and involves&nbsp;five
selected internet-facing government systems and websites with high user
touchpoints: gov.sg website;&nbsp;REACH website;&nbsp;Ministry of Communications
&amp; Information’s Press Accreditation Card (PAC) Online;&nbsp;Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MFA) website;&nbsp;and MFA eRegister.</p>
<p>GovTech and CSA will&nbsp;be partnering&nbsp;HackerOne&nbsp;–&nbsp;the
world’s largest community of cybersecurity researchers and white hat hackers&nbsp;-&nbsp;for&nbsp;the
GBBP. HackerOne successfully&nbsp;organised&nbsp;the Ministry of Defence’s
first BBP earlier this year.</p>
<p>The GBBP is part of the Singapore Government’s ongoing efforts to build
a secure and resilient Smart Nation. With cyber-attacks growing in scale
and complexity, the GBBP will help to&nbsp;build&nbsp;an innovative cyber
ecosystem, draw in a wide range of expertise to help identify the Government’s
cyber blind spots, and benchmark its defences against skilled global hackers.</p>
<p>By bringing together a community of cyber defenders who share the common
goal of developing safe and resilient cyberspace, the GBBP aims to build
a shared sense of collective ownership over the cybersecurity of Government
systems and websites, which is vital to achieving Singapore’s Smart Nation
goals.</p>
<p>Key findings from the GBBP will be shared&nbsp;in March 2019.&nbsp;The
GBBP&nbsp;will be expanded to include more Government ICT systems/websites&nbsp;in
future.</p>
