### **Design and Production of TraceTogether Token**

The Government Technology Agency has awarded the tender to design and manufacture further batches of the TraceTogether Tokens to two bidders - (a) a consortium comprising Siix Singapore Pte Ltd and iWOW Pte Ltd; and (b) PCI Private Limited. 

Drawing from the experience gained in producing the initial batch, GovTech will work with both tenderers to review their designs to further reduce cost, while ensuring effectiveness of the Token for contact tracing.  Each Token is expected to cost about $10. GovTech will manage and pace the production of further batches based on demand.
