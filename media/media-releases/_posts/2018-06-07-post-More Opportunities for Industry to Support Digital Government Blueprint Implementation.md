<p>Riding on the momentum of the Digital Government Blueprint launched this
week, the&nbsp;Government&nbsp;is partnering with the industry to accelerate
the delivery of end-to-end digital services to benefit citizens, businesses
and public&nbsp;officers,&nbsp;as part of Singapore’s Smart Nation efforts.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Government&nbsp;is taking steps to implement the Digital Government
Blueprint and will be investing in a wide range of Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) projects in FY18.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Government&nbsp;will partner
with the industry across technology domains such as communications infrastructure,
data analytics, robotics and cyber security to harness the transformative
power of technology to improve&nbsp;the lives of citizens and the competitiveness
of businesses.</p>
<h3>Greater&nbsp;role for SMEs to play in&nbsp;Government’s&nbsp;digitalisation effort</h3>
<p>There are many opportunities for the industry in building a Digital Government.
Through the Innoleap programme, research institutes, institutes of higher
learning and commercial entities can work with public sector agencies to
solve real-world problems. There are also the Ideas!&nbsp;portal, a Whole-of-Government
crowdsourcing platform for agencies to collaborate with the tech community
and the public to solve their challenges.</p>
<p>Last year, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) accounted for almost two-thirds
of the total number of ICT contracts awarded by the&nbsp;Government. We
expect this trend to continue in the FY18 procurement tenders.</p>
<p>Mr Kok Ping Soon, Chief&nbsp;Executive,&nbsp;of GovTech, said, “We are
excited by the many opportunities to collaborate with the&nbsp;industry,&nbsp;and
are currently engaged in many project discussions with them. We look forward
to working with the industry in using technology to improve the lives of
citizens, serve businesses better, and provide effective and convenient
public services.”</p>
<h3>Delivering user-friendly and seamless services to the public</h3>
<p>Citizens, businesses and public officers can expect more integrated, easy-to-use
and seamless digital services organised around their needs.&nbsp;The Moments
of Life (MOL) –&nbsp;Families mobile application to help families with
children aged six and below navigate&nbsp;key&nbsp;services such as searching
for preschool and accessing their child’s medical appointments and immunisation
records&nbsp;will be launched&nbsp;in June.</p>
<p>This MOL approach of delivering integrated services and information will
be progressively expanded&nbsp;to other&nbsp;key&nbsp;moments of life.
In addition to the MOL app, a digital platform called Parents Gateway is&nbsp;currently&nbsp;being
progressively rolled out to schools to help parents with school-going children
stay updated on school programmes and perform administrative tasks, such
as providing parental consent.</p>
<p>Businesses will also benefit from more stakeholder-centric digital services.
The&nbsp;Government&nbsp;is looking at reducing the number of touchpoints
with different&nbsp;Government&nbsp;agencies in the licensing process.&nbsp;Through&nbsp;mapping
the customer journey and transforming business processes, the&nbsp;Government&nbsp;aims
to deliver a digital service that will reduce the time taken and&nbsp;licence
fee which companies have to&nbsp;pay to start a food business.</p>
<p>Public officers can look forward to a more digitally-enabled workplace
through the Digital Workplace (DWP) programme. With the DWP Mobile app,
public officers&nbsp;will be able to&nbsp;access corporate digital services
on the go, such as booking meeting rooms and car park lots. In addition,
they can synchronise and view their work calendars on personal smartphones
and related devices through CalSync. These DWP solutions will be available
to officers of agencies that subscribe to them&nbsp;and more tools will
be rolled out&nbsp;to enhance the productivity of public officers.</p>
<h3>Key enabling platforms to transform government services delivery</h3>
<p>The delivery of these integrated services is made possible&nbsp;through
the development of common&nbsp;digital and data platforms. For example,
the National Digital Identity (NDI) project will provide a single digital
identity for citizens and businesses to transact with the&nbsp;Government&nbsp;securely
and seamlessly. The NDI will also enable digital signing to allow&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;to
process documents more efficiently and securely. As part of the NDI, citizens
can look forward to the new SingPass Mobile app, which&nbsp;will be launched&nbsp;in
the second half of this year.</p>
<p>To help government agencies speed up the development of digital services,
GovTech is building the Singapore Government Technology Stack (SG Tech
Stack). The SG Tech Stack is a self-service platform for agencies to&nbsp;build&nbsp;their
digital applications&nbsp;faster,&nbsp;and create a more consistent and
connected user experience.</p>
<p>These announcements were made&nbsp;at GovTech’s annual Smart Nation &amp;
Digital Government Industry Briefing,&nbsp;which&nbsp;was&nbsp;attended&nbsp;by
about 1,000 attendees from industry, academia and public agencies.</p>
