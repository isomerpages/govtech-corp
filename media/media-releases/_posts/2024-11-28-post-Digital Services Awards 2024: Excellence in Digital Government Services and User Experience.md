<p>Singapore, 28 November 2024</p>
<p>The fourth edition of the Digital Services Awards (DSA) celebrated the
outstanding contributions of 44 individuals, private organisations, and
government agencies across 10 categories for their efforts in advancing
digital government services and enhancing user experiences.</p>
<p>Held at the Lifelong Learning Institute, this year’s DSA event attracted
over 1,800 attendees both physically and virtually via livestream. Dr Janil
Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information
&amp; Health, and Minister-in-Charge of GovTech, was the Guest-of-Honour
and presented the awards to the winners. <em>(Please see Annex A for event photos and Annex B for the complete list of award recipients.)</em>
</p>
<p>In his remarks, Mr Goh Wei Boon, Chief Executive of GovTech stated, “We
are proud to celebrate the contributions of individuals and organisations
driving advancements in digital government services. By fostering strong
collaboration between government, industry, and citizens, we can better
keep pace with innovation and ensure our services remain relevant, user-centric,
and inclusive. Together, we are shaping the path towards realising the
vision of Smart Nation 2.0.”</p>
<p>Organised by GovTech and supported by the Ministry of Digital Development
and Information, the DSA is an annual event that has been recognising excellence
in digital government services since 2021. In 2023, additional award categories
were introduced to acknowledge the broader contributions of the Singapore
community towards improving digital government services.</p>
<h3><strong>Two new award categories to recognise mobile experience and user-centricity</strong></h3>
<p>This year’s DSA, themed “Sparking Co-creation, Igniting Innovation”, highlights
the vital role of co-creation and user-centric design in driving innovation
and improving digital services.</p>
<p>In line with the theme, two new award categories were introduced to celebrate
excellence in mobile experience and user-centricity: “Most Mobile Optimised
Website (Government and Industry)” and “Most User-Centric Website (Government)”.
These awards acknowledge both government and industry websites that deliver
the best mobile experiences and demonstrate a strong commitment to meeting
user needs.</p>
<p>The “Most Mobile Optimised Website” award category attracted over 40 nominations
from a diverse range of sectors, including the government agencies, private
companies, non-profit organisations, financial institutions, tertiary institutions,
and media outlets. Meanwhile, the “Most User-Centric Website” award received
nearly 20 nominations, all from government agencies.</p>
<p>The top 10 nominees in both categories were rigorously evaluated by a
panel of expert judges, based on a set of pre-determined criteria. Bonus
points awarded for exceptional innovation and proactive approaches in optimising
websites for user needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Award nominations assessed through analytics, expert judges and citizens</strong></h3>
<p>To ensure that only the best digital services are recognised, every DSA
nominee undergoes a rigorous four-month assessment process. This multi-stage
evaluation involves technical scoring using GovTech’s <a href="https://wogaa.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA) tool </a>,
along with expert reviews from industry leaders from Google, Microsoft,
Meta, IBM, Thoughtworks, GovTech, and many more.</p>
<p>Additionally, over 200 citizens, including persons with disabilities,
participated in evaluating the “Best Usability (Government)” and “Best
Usability (Industry)” categories. Their feedback played a critical role
in assessing the user-friendliness of digital services from both the public
and private sectors.</p>
<h3><strong>Recognising outstanding citizen contributors</strong></h3>
<p>In recognition of the valuable contributions made by citizens to the enhancement
of government digital services, nine individuals were honored with the
“Outstanding Citizen Contributor” award.</p>
<p>Three awardees were selected through an open call for nominations across
the Whole-of-Government, while six were selected from government-initiated
tech communities, including Tech Kaki<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;and CrowdTaskSG<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
<p>The impact of these contributors was evaluated by a distinguished panel
of esteemed experts committed to driving change and empowering lives through
technology and knowledge.</p>
