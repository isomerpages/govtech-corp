> More than nine in 10 businesses are using CorpPass 

From 1 September 2018, Singapore Corporate Access (CorpPass) will be the single login method for businesses to transact with more than 140 government digital services, replacing SingPass and EASY <sup>[1]</sup>
 
Following the launch of CorpPass in September 2016, more than 90 per cent of businesses are now using CorpPass to transact with government digital services.  

There are three key advantages to the use of CorpPass. First, it enhances cyber hygiene by allowing employees to use CorpPass instead of SingPass, to transact on their company’s behalf. Some company employees provided feedback that they shared their SingPass details with one another to conduct company transactions. Second, CorpPass allows companies greater convenience and visibility, by providing a single platform to grant and manage the authorisations given to their employees across all government digital services. Third, it allows business owners greater control, with the flexibility of granting employees separate roles to access government digital services.
 
CorpPass supports the Smart Nation objectives, and the Government’s aim to create secure and reliable digital services for citizens and businesses, as spelt out in the Digital Government Blueprint. 
 
Industry partners, such as the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) and Singapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC), have been promoting CorpPass to their members. 

Mr Victor Mills, Chief Executive, SICC, said, “I welcome CorpPass because it helps employees separate personal matters that are managed by their SingPass from work. CorpPass is the next logical step in Singapore’s continuing journey as a Smart Nation.” 

Mr Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive, Government Technology Agency, said, “We are heartened by the industry’s participation in the development of CorpPass as they play an important role in the Government’s digitalisation efforts. We thank businesses which have started using CorpPass, and strongly urge those who have not to do so right away. We will continue to strengthen integration with more government agencies and work closely with industry partners.”
