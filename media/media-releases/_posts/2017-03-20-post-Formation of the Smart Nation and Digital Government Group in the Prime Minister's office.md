<h3>Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG)</h3>
<p>Since the Smart Nation initiative was launched in late 2014, progress
has been made in applying digital and smart solutions to provide better
services for our citizens and businesses. Companies have also responded
with innovative products.</p>
<p>To enable the Government to be more integrated and responsive in our strategy
and processes for Smart Nation and Digital Government (SNDG), the following
organisational changes will take effect from 1 May 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO)</strong> will
be formed under the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office (PMO) comprising staff from
the Digital Government Directorate of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the
Government Technology Policy department in the Ministry of Communications
and Information (MCI), and the Smart Nation Programme Office (SNPO) in
the PMO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government Technology Agency (GovTech), a statutory board under MCI,
will be placed under the PMO as the implementing agency of SNDGO.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Collectively, the SNDGO and GovTech will form the <strong>Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG)</strong> in
the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office. Figure 1 [below] illustrates these organisational
changes.</p>

</p>
<p>The SNDGG shall be responsible for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply digital and smart technologies to improve citizensâ€™ lives in key domains, in partnership with other government agencies, industry, and the public.</strong> One
such key domain is urban mobility. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has
been using data analytics to better manage our bus fleets, reduce crowdedness
and improve timeliness. It has also been experimenting with self-driving
vehicle technologies. The SNDGG will work with LTA to further exploit existing
and emerging technologies to improve public transport, enhance urban logistics
and reduce congestion so as to enhance the commuter experience;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop the digital enablers and platforms for Smart Nation, to grow economic value and catalyse innovation by companies and citizens.</strong> The
SNDGG will build on the ongoing work by GovTech to enhance data sharing
through data.gov.sg, and partner the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
to promote e-payments. The SNDGG will also drive the development of a national
digital identity framework to facilitate digital transactions, and a national
sensor communication backbone (the Smart Nation Platform) to support agenciesâ€™
use of Internet of Things (IoT) applications to fulfil their missions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drive digital transformation for the public service, to strengthen Government ICT infrastructure and improve public service delivery.</strong> The
SNDGG will build up digital capabilities within Government, including in
areas such as data science and IoT, to continue delivering excellent public
services to our citizens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The SNDGG will be overseen by a Ministerial Committee chaired by Deputy
Prime Minister (DPM) Teo Chee Hean. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Minister for Communications
and Information will be Deputy Chairman and Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity
and the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).
The other members of the Ministerial Committee are Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,
Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative; Minister Ong Ye Kung,
who has been appointed to champion Public Service innovation; and Minister
of State Dr Janil Puthucheary, who will be the Minister-in-charge of GovTech
and who will also coordinate GovTechâ€™s strategy with IMDAâ€™s industry development
efforts.</p>
<p>Mr Ng Chee Khern, currently Permanent Secretary (PS) (Defence Development)
of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), will concurrently lead the SNDG Group
as the PS (Smart Nation and Digital Government). Mr Ng will also retain
his appointment as the Chairman of the GovTech Board.</p>
