<p><em>Over 80 per cent of contracts in FY2019 are available for SMEs to partner with the government in building a Smart Nation</em>
</p>
<p>One year into the implementation of the Digital Government Blueprint (DGB)&nbsp;‚Äì&nbsp;first
launched in June 2018&nbsp;‚Äì&nbsp;citizens and businesses have expressed
greater satisfaction with government digital services. The G2C (Government
to Citizens) satisfaction survey score increased from 73 to 78&nbsp;per
cent, and the G2B (Government to Businesses) score rose from 64 to 69&nbsp;per
cent&nbsp;in 2018.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the government has rolled out more digital services
that are integrated around citizens' and businesses‚Äô needs&nbsp;and built
common platforms to enable more seamless delivery of digital government
services. Some of the new products launched include Moments of Life, SingPass
Mobile and Parents Gateway (for citizens);&nbsp;Networked Trade Platform
and MyInfo Business (for businesses).</p>
<h3>Delivering secure, seamless and easy-to-use digital services through five platforms</h3>
<p>In FY2019, the government will focus on developing five&nbsp;platforms
that are key to meeting&nbsp;the DGB outcomes.&nbsp;These are the Singapore
Government Technology Stack (SGTS), National Digital Identity (NDI), Smart
Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP), Moments of Life (MOL), and Adaptive Digital
Workplace (ADWP) for public officers.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The SGTS&nbsp;is a technology stack that&nbsp;enables public agencies
to design, develop and deploy digital services more quickly and securely.
The stack is a ‚Äúdigital backbone‚Äù of reusable, interoperable&nbsp;and scalable&nbsp;micro-services
and digital infrastructure.&nbsp;Together with greater use of the commercial
cloud and cloud-native services, agencies will spend less time building
better digital products for citizens and businesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NDI is a digital credential that allows users to transact with the government
and businesses using a single trusted digital identity. Industry can&nbsp;make
use of&nbsp;the NDI to build new services and improve the security and
user experience of existing services. By the third quarter of FY19, the
government will launch ‚ÄúSG-Verify‚Äù, a facility for businesses to perform
secure identity verification and data transfer through QR scanning.&nbsp;This&nbsp;will
provide businesses with an alternative for visitor registration and access,
customer acquisition at roadshows, or any other use cases that require
identification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SNSP is a nationwide sensor platform to help public agencies enhance situational
awareness and provide more pre-emptive and responsive services to citizens
by collecting, sharing and analysing data. The Lamppost-as-a-Platform trial
will commence in the third quarter of FY19 in one-north and Geylang. The
trial will assess the efficacy of leveraging lampposts to provide connectivity
to and power various kinds of sensors by testing out use cases that support
municipal, mobility and security domains;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOL is&nbsp;the integration of&nbsp;different government services to be
delivered to the citizen around a specific moment in&nbsp;his or her&nbsp;life.&nbsp;MOL
was first launched in June 2018 for families of&nbsp;young children below
six years old.&nbsp;By the third quarter of FY19,&nbsp;Moments of Life
will be expanded&nbsp;to include new services that cater to other key life
stages, for example, in helping seniors lead active and engaged lives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ADWP&nbsp;is an enabling&nbsp;digital platform for public officers
to work more productively and collaborate better with other officers.&nbsp;As
part of the public sector‚Äôs shift to commercial cloud, cloud-based Microsoft
365 suite of products will be progressively rolled out starting&nbsp;from&nbsp;second
quarter of FY19.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Partnering with industry to build a Digital Government</h3>
<p>Over 60 per cent of FY19‚Äôs total info-communications and technology (ICT)
contract value is geared towards developing digital services on the five
platforms. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) will be able to participate
in over 80 per cent of the contracts in FY19.</p>
<p>An example of a local technology SME is&nbsp;Ufinity&nbsp;Pte Ltd, which
worked with the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) on the MOL project.&nbsp;Mr
Tung Teck Lee, Chief Executive Officer,&nbsp;Ufinity, said: ‚ÄúWe are excited
that the Government has continually provided ICT business opportunities
to smaller companies like ours,&nbsp;so that we can play a part in Singapore‚Äôs
Smart Nation drive.‚Äù</p>
<p>To make it easier for businesses to work with the Government,&nbsp;GovTech
has worked with the Ministry of Finance to streamline and introduce new
procurement methods for ICT contracts.&nbsp;These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Putting in place a new co-development partnership model for the industry
to co-develop projects with agencies on the SGTS;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabling dynamic contracting in upcoming bulk tenders to allow new suppliers
and requirements to be introduced throughout the contract period, thus
providing more opportunities for companies to join the panel of suppliers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating outcome-based procurement for Call for Solutions&nbsp;that
will enable&nbsp;agency to transition from crowdsourcing innovative solutions
to project pilot and subsequent deployment,&nbsp;without the need to call
for an additional tender.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive of GovTech, said: ‚ÄúCitizens and businesses
are more satisfied with our government digital services, but there is still
room for improvement as we progress towards meeting the DGB targets by
2023.&nbsp;In FY19, with our focus on the five key technology platforms,&nbsp;there
are many opportunities for public agencies&nbsp;to collaborate with the
industry, especially the SMEs, in using technology to improve the lives
of citizens, serve businesses better, and provide effective and convenient
public services.&nbsp;We&nbsp;are heartened&nbsp;that there is a growing
pool of SMEs that have stepped up and embraced technology, and we will
continue to work with them to uplift their capabilities while helping us
build a Smart Nation and Digital Government.‚Äù</p>
<p>The government‚Äôs progress in implementing DGB and the focus for FY2019
were announced by GovTech at the annual Smart Nation and Digital Government
Industry Briefing themed ‚ÄúEngineering Digital Government; Making Lives
Better‚Äù this morning.</p>
