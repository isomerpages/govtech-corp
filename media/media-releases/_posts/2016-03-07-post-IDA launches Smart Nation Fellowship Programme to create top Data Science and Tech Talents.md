<h3>Smart Nation Fellowship Programme</h3>
<p>The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) today launched the&nbsp;<strong>Smart Nation Fellowship Programme</strong>,
calling&nbsp;out top data scientists, technologists and engineers to help
the Singapore government deliver meaningful digital and data solutions
to improve&nbsp;the lives of citizens.</p>
<p>This initiative&nbsp;serves to encourage&nbsp;those passionate about the
intersection of technology and the public good to contribute to Singapore’s
Smart Nation initiative. These could include Singaporeans working overseas
for technology companies or others working in the private sector or academia
in Singapore.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is part of the government’s overall effort
to bring a wider group of engineers and technologists to contribute to
our Smart Nation efforts, as shared by the Prime Minister of Singapore,
Mr Lee Hsien Loong, during his earlier trip to San Francisco in February
2016.</p>
<p>Successful Fellowship applicants, or Fellows, will be appointed for short
stints of three to six months,&nbsp;and work alongside software engineers,
data scientists and product developers from the IDA’s Government Digital
Services (GDS) team, as well as users and developers from different government
agencies. They will design, build and deploy data science or technology
solutions to&nbsp;real world&nbsp;problems. To allow the Fellows to commence
work immediately,&nbsp;projects will be scoped out before they begin their
stint in Singapore.</p>
<p>Fellows will join a forward-looking GDS team to develop&nbsp;a suite of&nbsp;transformative
digital and data solutions for citizens. The GDS team works closely with
multiple government agencies responsible for areas such as transport, housing,
security, healthcare and the environment to leverage data-driven insights
to help create experimental applications such as Beeline, a mobile app
that meets commuter demand for express private bus routes through crowdsourcing;
MyResponder, a mobile app that mobilises the community to respond to cardiac
arrest cases within their immediate vicinity, and OneService, a one-stop
platform that enables citizens to send their immediate feedback on municipal
issues they encounter.</p>
<p>For a start, the government targets to appoint the inaugural batch of
four to eight Fellows by this year. IDA will also establish a global resource
network of fellowship&nbsp;alumni that the&nbsp;government can continually
tap into for their expertise in data science and technology projects over
the long term. Aspiring technology leaders already in various Government
agencies will also benefit from the opportunity to interact with the Fellows,
accelerating their learning and personal development and contributing to
the overall development of technology leadership for Singapore.</p>
<p>Ms Jacqueline Poh, Managing Director, IDA, said, “Building a Smart Nation
requires all hands on deck.&nbsp;There are many citizen-centric challenges
that&nbsp;are&nbsp;best tackled&nbsp;through the use of technology and
open data, but we&nbsp;need a core group of software engineers, designers
and product developers who can deliver data-driven insights for the public
good and develop tech solutions for citizens. To the credit of our education
system, our best and brightest engineers find themselves in demand by leading
technology companies all over the world. The government must continually
engage with and learn from these technology experts globally to actively
create technology applications that have the potential to change lives
in Singapore.&nbsp;We especially hope that Singaporeans abroad who have
established themselves in the tech sector will be excited&nbsp;at the prospect
of contributing&nbsp;some of their time to make a difference to our Smart
Nation vision and&nbsp;to&nbsp;inspire the next generation of technologists
in Singapore.”</p>
<p>Mr Liu Feng-Yuan, Director, Data Science Division, IDA, said, “It is not
just about crunching data and playing with the latest, coolest technologies.
What’s meaningful is harnessing insights that can improve public policy
and operations, innovating with technology, and building products and platforms&nbsp;that
can&nbsp;help make a difference in people’s lives. We look forward to working
with these passionate technologists to tackle challenges&nbsp;in areas&nbsp;such
as healthcare, transportation, Open Data and public service delivery.”</p>
