<h3>Mr Chan Cheow Hoe to join IDA</h3>
<p>The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) will be appointing
Mr Chan Cheow Hoe as the Government Chief Information Officer (CIO) /Assistant
Chief Executive (Government Chief Information Office or GCIO), effective
1 April 2014.</p>
<p>As the Government CIO, Mr Chan will oversee the Singapore&nbsp;Government’s&nbsp;central
information technology systems and infrastructure and drive the development
and delivery of innovative public services for citizens and businesses
in partnership with ministries and agencies. He will report to Ms Jacqueline
Poh, the Managing Director of IDA.</p>
<p>Mr Chan has more than two decades of extensive experience in senior management
positions overseeing&nbsp;organisation-wide&nbsp;IT development and systems.
He also has a strong track record of leading IT professionals in global
companies and large corporations to deliver efficient and effective IT
systems and solutions. His expertise includes leading organisations through
transformational change and connecting IT to the&nbsp;needs of the organisation.</p>
<p>Mr Chan joins IDA from CT Corporation, one of the largest conglomerates
in Indonesia with interests in financial services, retail, media, travel
and entertainment, where&nbsp;he served as Group Chief of Information Technology
and Systems. Prior to CT Corporation, Mr Chan held senior positions in
Citibank, Barclays, Ernst &amp; Young, ABN-AMRO and DELL Computers.</p>
<p>The current Assistant Chief Executive (GCIO), Mr James Kang, will&nbsp;be
returning&nbsp;to the private sector. Since joining IDA in 2008, Mr Kang
has played a&nbsp;key&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;the Singapore
e-Government Masterplan 2011-2015 (eGov2015), which aims to facilitate
greater co-creation between the Government, people and private sectors
to create value for Singapore. The revamped eCitizen portal, OneInbox,
Government Cloud and the opening up of government data through <a href="http://data.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">data.gov.sg</a> are
some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;initiatives launched under the Masterplan. During
his tenure, Mr Kang initiated the building of new core skills within the
GCIO, such as Agile development, user experience design and business analytics,
thus boosting government capabilities and efficiency. All these initiatives
have contributed to the continued international recognition of Singapore
as a leading e-government in the world.</p>
<p>Ms Jacqueline Poh, IDA MD, said:&nbsp;“IDA expresses our deep appreciation
to Mr James Kang for his service and dedication to Singapore. In his&nbsp;more
than&nbsp;five years at the helm of the&nbsp;Government's&nbsp;Chief Information
Office, he has made considerable contributions to IT development within
the Singapore Government, tapping into new technologies like cloud computing
and business analytics to enhance our capabilities.</p>
<p>“We look forward to welcoming Mr Chan Cheow Hoe&nbsp;into&nbsp;IDA. His
extensive experience in managing technology development in large and complex
businesses will be valuable in&nbsp;IDA’s&nbsp;continued efforts to ensure
operational resilience, transform the Government sector and uplift digital
services&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to better serve our citizens.”</p>
