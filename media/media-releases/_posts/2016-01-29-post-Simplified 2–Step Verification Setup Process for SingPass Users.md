<h3>SingPass users can now set up their 2-Step Verification (2FA) with greater ease and convenience.</h3>
<p>As part of ongoing enhancements to the SingPass system, the 2FA setup
process has&nbsp;been simplified&nbsp;such that users only need to do the
following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Log into their SingPass account and click ‚ÄúSet Up 2-Step Verification
(2FA)‚Äù under the Quick Links section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register for SMS or OneKey token via the SingPass website, after which&nbsp;a
pin mailer with an activation code will be sent&nbsp;to their registered
address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send the activation code to 78111 via SMS, or log into Assurity‚Äôs website
to activate their 2FA</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To confirm that they have set up their 2FA, users can log into their SingPass
account, click ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù, followed by&nbsp;‚ÄúManage 2-Step Verification‚Äù.
If&nbsp;they have not set up their 2FA,&nbsp;they will be prompted&nbsp;to
do so.</p>
<p>From 5th July 2016, over 100 government e-services by agencies, such as
MOM, CPF, IRAS and ACRA, will require 2FA to perform e-transactions.&nbsp;This&nbsp;means
that in addition to their SingPass username and password, users will need
to enter a One-Time Password (OTP) sent via SMS or generated through a
OneKey token.</p>
<p>If users do not set up their SingPass 2FA:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>They will not be able to perform sensitive government e-transactions,
such as&nbsp;IRAS tax filing&nbsp;and accessing CPF statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They will need to wait&nbsp;for&nbsp;up to seven working days for a pin
mailer to activate their 2FA before&nbsp;they can perform&nbsp;sensitive
e-transactions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ms Jacqueline Poh, Managing Director of Infocomm Development Authority
of Singapore, said, ‚ÄúWe are consistently improving our e-services to ensure
that they are as user-friendly as possible, without compromising security,
such as enabling users to activate their 2FA via SMS. We encourage all
users to set up their SingPass 2FA early&nbsp;so that they can&nbsp;continue
to perform their government e-transactions safely and without any disruption.‚Äù</p>
