<p>Citizens and businesses can look forward to better and more citizen-centric
services with the establishment of the new Government Technology Agency
or GovTech. The new statutory board will spearhead the government‚Äôs digital
and data strategy. It will partner with public agencies, industry and citizens
to transform public service delivery through the use of technologies such
as data science and analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<h3>Spearheading digital transformation</h3>
<p>At the launch of GovTech this morning, Minister for Communications and
Information Dr Yaacob Ibrahim elaborated on the new agency‚Äôs direction.
He announced that GovTech - which manages the national digital identity
SingPass ‚Äì and the Ministry of Finance will partner with the Monetary Authority
of Singapore over the next year to explore extending the use of consent-based
personal data platform MyInfo to the financial sector. This Proof-of-Concept
aims to simplify citizens‚Äô interactions with banks by eliminating the provision
of personal documents for verification.</p>
<p>Another initiative addressing citizens‚Äô needs is new digital platform
Parents Gateway which will bring greater convenience to parents on school
matters such as fee payments and signing of consent forms. The Ministry
of Education and GovTech will be testing out the Parents Gateway concept
at five schools beginning in November 2016.</p>
<p>Businesses will also benefit from GovTech‚Äôs move to streamline government-business
transactions. For instance, CorpPass was launched last month as a new single
corporate digital identity for businesses and other entities - such as
non-profit organisations and associations - to transact with Government
agencies online without the need to handle multiple login IDs.&nbsp;GovTech
will also collaborate with Singapore Customs to build the National Trade
Platform, a one-stop next-generation trade information management platform
to support companies in the trade and logistics industry, as well as&nbsp;adjacent
sectors such as trade finance.</p>
<h3>Enabling Singapore‚Äôs Smart Nation vision</h3>
<p>GovTech will also play an&nbsp;important&nbsp;role in the building of
Smart Nation infrastructure, platforms and applications by deploying information
communications technology (ICT) and related engineering, such as the Internet
of Things (IoT).&nbsp;The Smart Nation Platform (or SNP) is being developed
by GovTech with&nbsp;common&nbsp;infrastructure and services such as a&nbsp;data
sharing&nbsp;gateway and video and data analytics capabilities. This&nbsp;helps
public agencies with their sensor deployment needs, the sharing of data
collected and data analytics to support needs like urban planning and incident
response. The SNP&nbsp;is envisioned&nbsp;to help public agencies run the
city efficiently, including the provision of public services such as&nbsp;smart&nbsp;mobility
and&nbsp;smart&nbsp;utility management.</p>
<h3>Keeping systems resilient and secure</h3>
<p>GovTech will also play a critical role in overseeing the public sector‚Äôs
ICT infrastructure, putting&nbsp;in place&nbsp;policies for critical infrastructure
and cybersecurity to enable the operation of a secure and resilient Smart
Nation.&nbsp;As part of efforts to ensure that ICT systems are interoperable
and to&nbsp;make the most of recent advances in technology, GovTech will&nbsp;be
developing&nbsp;standards in areas such as data and IoT, as well as&nbsp;continue
to conduct bulk tenders for the government‚Äôs ICT needs.</p>
<h3>Developing tech and engineering capabilities</h3>
<p>GovTech will raise technical capability across the public sector by building
and strengthening in-house technical expertise and capabilities in six
areas&nbsp;-&nbsp;application development, cybersecurity, data science,
geospatial technology, government ICT infrastructure&nbsp;and sensors &amp;&nbsp;IoT.&nbsp;For
example, GovTech‚Äôs Data Science team is working with various government
economic agencies on Pulse of the Economy, an initiative that&nbsp;uses
high-frequency big data to develop new indicators for better economic and
urban planning.</p>
<p>In line with capability building and talent development, GovTech will
also expand the Smart Nation Fellowship Programme,&nbsp;which&nbsp;was&nbsp;first
launched&nbsp;in March 2016. The first two Smart Nation Fellows ‚Äì selected
from nearly 300 applicants - started their stints progressively with GovTech‚Äôs
Government Digital Services unit at Hive in July 2016.</p>
<h3>Working with citizens for co-creation</h3>
<p>GovTech will create platforms to enable citizen and&nbsp;industry‚Äôs&nbsp;co-creation
of citizen-centric digital services. GovTech has revamped the government‚Äôs
open data portal, <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/files/media/media-releases/2016/10/1%20GovTech%20Factsheet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">data.gov.sg</a>,
to include a developers‚Äô portal where developers and industry can tap on
the application programming interfaces (APIs)&nbsp;in the site&nbsp;to
create useful applications.</p>
<p>Citizens are actively encouraged to help GovTech refine the user experience
design of digital services and take part in focus groups in GovTech‚Äôs Digital
Experience Lab.&nbsp;This&nbsp;will enable GovTech and its public sector
partners to design and deliver meaningful products and solutions tailored
to citizens‚Äô needs.</p>
<p>Jacqueline Poh, Chief Executive of GovTech, said: ‚ÄúTechnology is playing
a disruptive role in many sectors, and government must tap into it in new
ways to deliver better value to citizens. The formation of GovTech marks
a new chapter in&nbsp;the way&nbsp;we use technology to improve the wide
range of services and touchpoints that the public sector has with our citizens
and businesses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGovTech will build on the strong foundation established by the Government
Chief Information Office to support&nbsp;the&nbsp;building&nbsp;of&nbsp;a
Smart Nation.&nbsp;Key to our mission will be collaborating closely with
citizens, industry and various public sector agencies to create the next
generation of innovative and meaningful digital experiences.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Public exhibition</h3>
<p>As part of its launch, GovTech will&nbsp;be organising&nbsp;a public exhibition
at the foyer of Star Vista over the weekend of 8-9 October, showcasing&nbsp;the
array of citizen-centric digital services and products developed with public
sector partners.&nbsp;The exhibition&nbsp;is free and opens from 10am to
8pm.</p>
