Riding on the momentum of the Digital Government Blueprint launched this week, the Government is partnering the industry to accelerate the delivery of end-to-end digital services to benefit citizens, businesses and public officers, as part of Singapore’s Smart Nation efforts.

The Government is taking steps to implement the Digital Government Blueprint, and will be investing in a wide range of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) projects in FY18. The Government will partner the industry across technology domains such as communications infrastructure, data analytics, robotics and cyber security to harness the transformative power of technology to improve the lives of citizens, and competitiveness of businesses.

### **Greater role for SMEs to play in Government’s digitalisation effort**
There are many opportunities for the industry in building a Digital Government. Through the Innoleap programme, research institutes, institutes of higher learning and commercial entities can work with public sector agencies to solve real-world problems. There is also the Ideas! portal, a Whole-of-Government crowdsourcing platform for agencies to collaborate with the tech community and the public to solve their challenges.

Last year, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) accounted for almost two-thirds of the total number of ICT contracts awarded by the Government.  We expect this trend to continue in the FY18 procurement tenders. 
 
Mr Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive, GovTech, said, “We are excited by the many opportunities to collaborate with the industry, and are currently engaged on many project discussions with them. We look forward to working with the industry in using technology to improve the lives of citizens, serve businesses better, and provide effective and convenient public services.”

### **Delivering user friendly and seamless services to the public**
Citizens, businesses and public officers can expect more integrated, easy to use and seamless digital services organised around their needs.  The Moments of Life (MOL) – Families mobile application to help families with children aged six and below navigate key services such as searching for preschool and accessing their child’s medical appointments and immunisation records will be launched in June. 
 
This MOL approach of delivering integrated services and information will be progressively expanded to other key moments of life.  In addition to the MOL app, a digital platform called Parents Gateway is currently being progressively rolled out to schools to help parents with school-going children stay updated on school programmes and perform administrative tasks, such as providing parental consent.

Businesses will also benefit from more stakeholder-centric digital services. The Government is looking at reducing the number of touchpoints with different Government agencies in the licensing process.  Through mapping the customer journey and transforming business processes, the Government aims to deliver a digital service that will reduce the time taken and licence fee which companies have to pay to start a food business.
 
Public officers can look forward to a more digitally-enabled workplace through the Digital Workplace (DWP) programme.  With the DWP Mobile app, public officers will be able to access corporate digital services on the go, such as booking meeting rooms and car park lots. In addition, they can synchronise and view their work calendars on personal smartphones and related devices through CalSync. These DWP solutions will be available to officers of agencies that subscribe to them and more tools will be rolled out to enhance the productivity of public officers.

### **Key enabling platforms to transform government services delivery**
The delivery of these integrated services is made possible through the development of common digital and data platforms.  For example, the National Digital Identity (NDI) project will provide a single digital identity for citizens and businesses to transact with the Government securely and seamlessly. The NDI will also enable digital signing to allow businesses to process documents more efficiently and securely. As part of the NDI, citizens can look forward to the new SingPass Mobile app, which will be launched in the second half of this year.    
 
To help government agencies speed up the development of digital services, GovTech is building the Singapore Government Technology Stack (SG Tech Stack). The SG Tech Stack is a self-service platform for agencies to build their digital applications faster, and create a more consistent and connected user experience.
 
These announcements were made at GovTech’s annual Smart Nation & Digital Government Industry Briefing, which was attended by about 1,000 attendees from industry, academia and public agencies.
