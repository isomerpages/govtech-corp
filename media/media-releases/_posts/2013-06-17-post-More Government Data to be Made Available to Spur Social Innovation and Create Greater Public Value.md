<p>As part of its strategy to drive social innovation and deepen co-creation
efforts with citizens, the Government will be releasing more data to the
public. A new data service - PopulationQuery - was announced by Guest-of-honour,
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam
at the eGov Global Exchange today.</p>
<p>With the theme "Engaging Citizens, Co-creating the Future", this year's
eGov Global Exchange discussed how the Government can work with businesses
and the public to develop public services, use technologies to promote
closer collaboration with businesses, and achieve new efficiencies for
the public sector.</p>
<p>The event saw a turnout of more than 500 delegates, comprising top industry
leaders, academics and representatives from international organizations.
Amongst the participants are 70 ministers and senior government officials
from 60 countries/regions.</p>
<p>Having reached the mid-term mark of the five-year eGov2015 Masterplan
launched two years ago, the Government shared updates on its e-Government
progress as well as key highlights of its upcoming plans.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance,
Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam said: "By opening up more data, and through innovative
use of technology, we can crowd-source ideas and co-create applications
with the wider community."</p>
<h3>PopulationQuery and Machine-Readable Data to Encourage Social Innovation</h3>
<p>The Government wants to better use data that it has to catalyse new ideas
and services.</p>
<p>OneMap, the Government’s one-stop geospatial data platform, will feature
a new service - PopulationQuery. PopulationQuery gives the public free
and easy access to graphic and visual representations of Singapore’s demographic
landscapes by displaying Singapore’s population data on a map by residential
zones or commercial areas. Together with other OneMap data such as location
of schools, public facilities or property prices in that area, PopulationQuery
can generate new insights and assist users in decision making. For example,
it can show the best places to set up a business, and attributes of the
area when considering whether to purchase a property. It can also provide
more information for research and analysis purposes.</p>
<p>The Government’s one-stop data portal - data.gov.sg - has seen a 60% increase
in the number of data sets since its launch in 2011. The public can now
access over 8,600 data sets from more than 60 public agencies for app development
or research purposes. More data sets such as lightning information and
more granular traffic accident data in machine-readable formats will be
made available too.</p>
<p>The Government will also work towards making all data sets on data.gov.sg
and OneMap machine-readable by end 2013. Unlike PDF formats where information
is “locked”, machine-readable formats (e.g. XLS, APIs) enables users to
slice and dice data easily. For example, a mobile app developer can pull
real time data such as transport or weather data, for use in developing
his application.</p>
<p>A new feature will also be introduced on data.gov.sg and OneMap for citizens
to request data sets from government more easily.</p>
<h3>Improved Citizen Engagement and Satisfaction with e-Government Services</h3>
<p>The Government continues to improve its service delivery, as shown in
this year’s e-Government Customer Perception Survey, with satisfaction
levels hitting 96% and 93% for citizens and businesses respectively. This
shows a 2% and 3%-point improvement from the last year’s survey respectively.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to tap on new technologies to improve our
public service delivery so as to increase convenience and improve our customers’
experience.</p>
<p>To increase convenience for businesses and improve productivity, the Government
will implement ‘CorpPass’ which will replace the use of SingPass for corporate
e-services. CorpPass will bring about better segregation of personal and
corporate passwords, and will allow authorised staff to access multiple
corporate e-services through one common authorisation system. Businesses
can look forward to using CorpPass in early 2016.</p>
<h3>New Era of Efficiency for the Government</h3>
<p>A key capability that the Government is looking into developing is in
Data and Analytics, which will allow agencies to derive richer insights
from the data collected so as to improve our policy formulation, enhance
agency operations, service delivery, and customer engagement.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Manpower will be launching a new interactive website that
provides official statistical information on Singapore’s labour market.
Employers and employees will be able to benchmark their organisations’
performance against the national or industry norms on wages, employment
conditions and staff turnover using tools available on the website. This
website is expected to be launched later this year.</p>
<p>Another focus is Cloud computing as an infocomm solution to enable easy
sharing of computing resources and applications amongst agencies. After
establishing the Government Cloud (G-Cloud) Infrastructure in 2012, the
Government will be offering, to agencies Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions
such as business analytics and customer relationship management. The aggregation
of demand for such solutions will generate cost savings for the Government.</p>
<p>A showcase of most of these initiatives can be found at the IDA booth
at the Infocomm Media Business Exchange from 18 June to 21 June 2013.</p>
