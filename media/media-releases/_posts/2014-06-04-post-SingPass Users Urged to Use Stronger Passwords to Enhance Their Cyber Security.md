<p>On Monday, 2 June 2014,&nbsp;IDA was notified by&nbsp;the SingPass operator
that a number of SingPass users had received a SingPass Password Reset
Notification Letter even though they did not request&nbsp;for any&nbsp;password
reset.</p>
<p>IDA’s preliminary investigations revealed that&nbsp;1,560 users’ IDs and
passwords had potentially been accessed&nbsp;without the users’ permission.
An anomaly&nbsp;was detected&nbsp;between the number of mobile numbers
used for Immediate Reset One Time Passwords, and the number of SingPass
accounts&nbsp;that&nbsp;they&nbsp;were tied to.&nbsp;Of these 1,560 users,
419 passwords were also reset, triggering the SingPass Password Reset Notification
Letters to&nbsp;be sent&nbsp;to the&nbsp;registered address of the actual
account holder.</p>
<p>A police report was lodged&nbsp;on 3 June 2014, and the matter is currently
under investigation.</p>
<p>Based on IDA’s checks, there is no evidence to suggest that the SingPass
system has&nbsp;been compromised.</p>
<p>The passwords of all&nbsp;affected users have been reset and we are in
the process of notifying them of this incident.</p>
<p>“For every individual, this incident underlines the importance of taking
personal responsibility for cyber security. The Government strongly urges
all SingPass users to take the necessary precautions to enhance their cyber
security. They should ensure that they use strong passwords to access&nbsp;not
only SingPass but&nbsp;all the other e-services they subscribe to. Strong
passwords contain a combination of numerical figures and capital letters
and are at least eight characters long. Users should also install anti-virus
software and update all their software regularly,” said Ms Jacqueline Poh,
Managing Director of the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p>The Singapore Government takes cyber security very seriously.&nbsp;The
protection of&nbsp;personal data and&nbsp;the delivery of secure e-Services&nbsp;are
critical. We will continue to strengthen all Government&nbsp;e-Services&nbsp;as
part of&nbsp;on-going&nbsp;efforts to enhance security.&nbsp;Users can
