<p>The annual Digital Services Awards (DSA)[1], organised by the Government
Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) and supported by Smart Nation
Group, expanded beyond government agencies for the first time to encourage
broader participation and acknowledge the valuable contributions of citizens
and private organisations.</p>
<p>Held on 24 November 2023 at the Devan Nair Institute for Employment and
Employability, this year’s event saw 350 physical attendees, with another
500 joining via livestream. Senior Minister of State for Ministry of Communications
and Information and Minister-in-Charge of GovTech, Dr Janil Puthucheary,
graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour and presented awards to 33 winners
across eight award categories. (Please see Annex A for event photos and
Annex B for the complete list of award winners.)</p>
<h3>Two new award categories to recognise industry efforts</h3>
<p>The third edition of DSA features two new award categories solely for
the private sector – “Best Usability (Industry)” and “Most Popular Informational
Website (Industry)”. These two awards recognise non-government websites
based on ease of use, how useful the sites are, and user satisfaction.</p>
<p>The “Best Usability (Industry)” award category saw close to 50 wide-ranging
nominations from the private sector, including non-profit organisations,
well-established companies, and media publications. The top 10 nominees
were eligible for the “Most Popular Informational Website (Industry)” category,
and the winner was determined through live voting by attendees during the
award ceremony.</p>
<h3>Award nominations assessed through analytics, and by expert judges and citizens</h3>
<p>To ensure only the best digital services are recognised, DSA nominees
and entries undergo a rigorous assessment process spanning four months.
The process comprises multiple stages, involving technical scoring by GovTech’s
Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA) tool (<a href="https://wogaa.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://wogaa.sg</a>)
and expert judges from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Design Business Chamber
Singapore, GovTech, and many more. Two hundred citizens, including persons
with disabilities, were also involved in selecting and evaluating the “Best
Usability (Government)” and “Best Usability (Industry)” categories.</p>
<h3>New award category to honour citizens’ contributions</h3>
<p>In line with this year’s theme, “Empathy at the Heart of Tech”, which
underscores the significance of co-creating digital services with users
and serving their needs with ease and delight, a new award category (“Outstanding
Citizen Contributor”) has also been introduced. This category celebrates
citizens who have actively participated and contributed to improving government
digital services.</p>
<p>Nine citizens who have generously devoted their time and resources to
enhance government digital services were honoured at the Awards. Three
awardees were selected through an open call for nominations across the
Whole-of-Government, and six were selected from government-initiated tech
communities such as Tech Kaki[2] and CrowdTaskSG[3]. Besides experts who
drive social technology initiatives and strive to empower lives through
technology, media representatives from The Straits Times and Channel 8
News were also part of the judging panel involved in the evaluation of
this award category.</p>
<h3>Raising digital standards in Singapore</h3>
<p>Mr Goh Wei Boon, Chief Executive, of GovTech, said, “We hope the new award
categories will encourage more citizens and private sector organisations
to improve the usability and inclusiveness of local digital services. We
want to foster more collaboration, innovation, and excellence in digital
service delivery, and this expansion is a significant step in that direction.
We thank the industry and citizen participation for joining us in this
effort.”</p>
