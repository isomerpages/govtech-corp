<p>The annual Digital Services Awards (DSA)<sup>[1]</sup>, organised by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) and supported by Smart Nation Group, expanded beyond government agencies for the first time to encourage broader participation and acknowledge the valuable contributions of citizens and private organisations.</p><p>Held on 24 November 2023 at the Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability, this year’s event saw 350 physical attendees, with another 500 joining via livestream. Senior Minister of State for Ministry of Communications and Information and Minister-in-Charge of GovTech, Dr Janil Puthucheary, graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour and presented awards to 33 winners across eight award categories. (Please see Annex A for event photos and Annex B for the complete list of award winners.)</p><h3>Two new award categories to recognise industry efforts</h3><p>The third edition of DSA features two new award categories solely for the private sector – “Best Usability (Industry)” and “Most Popular Informational Website (Industry)”. These two awards recognise non-government websites based on ease of use, how useful the sites are, and user satisfaction.</p><p>The “Best Usability (Industry)” award category saw close to 50 wide-ranging nominations from the private sector, including non-profit organisations, well-established companies, and media publications. The top 10 nominees were eligible for the “Most Popular Informational Website (Industry)” category, and the winner was determined through live voting by attendees during the award ceremony.</p><h3>Award nominations assessed through analytics, and by expert judges and citizens</h3><p>To ensure only the best digital services are recognised, DSA nominees and entries undergo a rigorous assessment process spanning four months. The process comprises multiple stages, involving technical scoring by GovTech’s Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA) tool (<a href="https://wogaa.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://wogaa.sg</a>) and expert judges from Google, Microsoft, Meta, Design Business Chamber Singapore, GovTech, and many more. Two hundred citizens, including persons with disabilities, were also involved in selecting and evaluating the “Best Usability (Government)” and “Best Usability (Industry)” categories.</p><h3>New award category to honour citizens’ contributions</h3><p>In line with this year’s theme, “Empathy at the Heart of Tech”, which underscores the significance of co-creating digital services with users and serving their needs with ease and delight, a new award category (“Outstanding Citizen Contributor”) has also been introduced. This category celebrates citizens who have actively participated and contributed to improving government digital services.</p><p>Nine citizens who have generously devoted their time and resources to enhance government digital services were honoured at the Awards. Three awardees were selected through an open call for nominations across the Whole-of-Government, and six were selected from government-initiated tech communities such as Tech Kaki<sup>[2]</sup> and CrowdTaskSG<sup>[3]</sup>. Besides experts who drive social technology initiatives and strive to empower lives through technology, media representatives from The Straits Times and Channel 8 News were also part of the judging panel involved in the evaluation of this award category.</p><h3>Raising digital standards in Singapore</h3><p>Mr Goh Wei Boon, Chief Executive, of GovTech, said, “We hope the new award categories will encourage more citizens and private sector organisations to improve the usability and inclusiveness of local digital services. We want to foster more collaboration, innovation, and excellence in digital service delivery, and this expansion is a significant step in that direction. We thank the industry and citizen participation for joining us in this effort.”</p><p>For more information about the DSA, please visit:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><a href="https://www.digitalservicesawards.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DSA 2023 website</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://go.gov.sg/technews-dsa2023" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TechNews by GovTech</a></p></li></ul><hr><p>ISSUED BY THE COMMUNICATIONS AND MARKETING GROUP</p><p>GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY AGENCY OF SINGAPORE</p><hr><p><sup>[1]</sup> Held annually since 2021, the Digital Services Awards was first introduced by the government to recognise outstanding achievements and excellence in delivering digital services to the public.
