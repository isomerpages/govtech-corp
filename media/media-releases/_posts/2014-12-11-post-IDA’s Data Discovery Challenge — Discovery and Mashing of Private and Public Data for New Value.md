<h3>Competition to raise businesses' and consumers’ understanding and use of data in a Smart Nation</h3>
<p>Singapore is building the world’s first Smart Nation, where data and analytics
will&nbsp;play a critical role. To support this vision, the Infocomm Development
Authority of Singapore (IDA) announced the start of a new Data Discovery
Challenge today.</p>
<p>Through the Data Discovery Challenge, it seeks to raise&nbsp;awareness
to&nbsp;enterprises&nbsp;on&nbsp;the benefits of making available private
datasets, which when&nbsp;pooled with other datasets,&nbsp;is able to&nbsp;uncover
new insights and values, bringing the data to better use and helping enterprises&nbsp;to&nbsp;create
new products and services, enhance&nbsp;customer’s experience&nbsp;or improve
their business operations in a Smart Nation.&nbsp;The possibilities are
endless.</p>
<p>It is also the first challenge to utilise a federated dataset discovery
mechanism (named the Federated Dataset Registry or FDSR) that seeks to
provide a coherent method for dataset discovery in the private sector.
The FDSR was launched as part of the Data-as-a-Service pilot in October
this year to support the development of a Data Marketplace where both public
and private sector data can be shared or used for commerce.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is
one of the preliminary ideas&nbsp;being&nbsp;outlined&nbsp;for the Infocomm
Media Masterplan. Public datasets are already available through central
portals such as data.gov.sg.</p>
<p>IDA Executive Deputy Chairman,&nbsp;Mr Steve Leonard said, “Singapore
is on its way to be the world’s first Smart Nation. We well understand
the importance of finding new ways to effectively use data to deal with
challenges&nbsp;of&nbsp;healthcare, transport and energy, to name just
three areas. In the midst of&nbsp;harnessing data effectively, we also&nbsp;well&nbsp;understand
the importance of protecting the data and respecting the privacy of individuals.”</p>
<p>Participants&nbsp;of&nbsp;the challenge stand to win not just the top
prize of S$5,000 in cash,&nbsp;but also opportunities for the promising
teams to work with partners post-challenge to take their ideas further.
For instance, key partner SingTel will&nbsp;be supporting&nbsp;the acceleration
and potential commercialisation of relevant ideas that emerge, in&nbsp;addition
to providing anonymised and aggregated datasets, SingTel may also explore
seed funding for these ideas.</p>
<p>Mr Bill Chang, Chief Executive Officer of SingTel Group Enterprise, said:
“As a company with millions of customers and operations&nbsp;around the
world, SingTel has a unique richness of data and location intelligence
that we are translating into real insights to benefit customers, businesses
and the larger community. By reaching out and engaging the broader community
of innovators, researchers and entrepreneurs through initiatives such as
IDA’s Data Challenge, we can help catalyse Singapore’s aspirations of becoming
the first Smart Nation in the world.”</p>
<p>Other partners, such as data providers like DFRC Pte Ltd, DP Information
Network Pte Ltd and Elixir Technology Pte Ltd, will&nbsp;also&nbsp;work
with promising teams to explore collaboration in bringing their ideas to
potential commercialisation.</p>
<p>Participants&nbsp;such as&nbsp;the data community,&nbsp;both&nbsp;data
providers and data scientists are invited to participate in this challenge.</p>
