<p>Is ownership of public housing a sure win for financial gain? Will chances
of returning to crime be reduced with greater social acceptance of ex-offenders?
These were some ideas from participating teams at the finals of Government
Technology Agency (GovTech)’s inaugural National Data Visualisation Video
Challenge held today.</p>
<p>The Challenge, themed “How Open Data makes a difference for you and me”,
saw over 80 submissions by more than 200 students from Universities, Polytechnics
and Institutes of Technical Education (ITE). Following eight months of
preparation and selection, 12 teams made it to the finals to create a video
with data visualisation to share how open data could improve lives.</p>
<p>Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Ministry of Communications
and Information &amp; Ministry of Education, and Minister-in-charge of
GovTech, was the Guest-of-Honour for the Finals. Dr Janil presented prizes
to the top three winning teams.</p>
<p>The 12 teams used a myriad of open government datasets, including the
number of seniors and locations of eldercare services, data on water consumption
and water supply sources as well as recidivism rates to draw out interesting
insights and present them through a video story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Challenge allowed us to freely explore data and find meaningful use
of data to improve our daily lives.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ms Wang Zejia</p>
<p>From the datasets, the teams unearthed new insights such as the towns
in Singapore that would require more eldercare facilities, the pressing
need for water conservation in Singapore, and the importance of social
acceptance to prevent ex-offenders from re-offending.</p>
<p>The Challenge, supported by six industry partners namely Amazon Web Services,
Carousell, Cloudera, Microsoft, Google and The Straits Times, also displayed
ability of students to cross-analyse data and come up with tools such as
automating the income growth and key expenses of users until their selected
retirement age. Please see <strong>Annex 1</strong> for more details on the
projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It was a chance for us to showcase our creativity through data analysis
and we learnt a lot from the Challenge.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TEAM N.I.C.E.</p>
<p>Ms Jacqueline Poh, Chief Executive, GovTech, and one of the judges in
the Finals, said, “I am impressed with the videos and encouraged by the
strong support from industry partners. Aimed at driving Singapore’s open
data movement, this Challenge brought together students from different
tertiary institutions in Singapore, and enabled them to see the usefulness
of the open government data that is available to the public. GovTech will
continue to cultivate this culture of co-creation with our citizens and
industry.”</p>
<p>Ms Wang Zejia of Team TongQiang, formed by two female undergraduates from
National University of Singapore, said, “The Challenge allowed us to freely
explore data and find meaningful use of data to improve our daily lives.”
Team N.I.C.E., one of the three ITE finalist teams, said, “It was a chance
for us to showcase our creativity through data analysis and we learnt a
lot from the Challenge.”</p>
<p>In line with Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, the Challenge encourages
greater use of open government data, starting with students, to raise awareness,
catalyse innovation and create greater economic value.</p>
<p>Launched in 2011, the country’s open government portal, data.gov.sg, was
enhanced in late 2015 and has seen an increase of 40% in unique monthly
visitors to about 94,000 in the last year. The number of quality datasets
have also increased to 1,200 since inception. These datasets are available
to citizens, developers, researchers and students to develop new ideas
and make better use of open government data.</p>
