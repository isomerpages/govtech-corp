<h3>Increased investment in modernisation of digital infrastructure</h3>
<p>Over 60 per cent ($2.1 billion) of the Government’s projected FY24 ICT
procurement opportunities will go towards enhancing its digital infrastructure,
up from $1.3 billion in FY23. With the public increasingly relying on digital
services to interact with the Government, strengthening the resilience
of digital infrastructure is crucial for the Government to minimise disruptions
and uphold public trust. Projected infrastructure investment has been on
an upward trend since FY21, as the Government seeks to lay the foundation
for deep digital transformation across the Public Service.</p>
<p>Existing infrastructure must be re-engineered to reduce the complexities
of ICT systems, modernise ageing systems, and bolster defences against
evolving cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to encourage the adoption of reusable development
tools by the industry. In addition to reducing costs, such “build once,
use often” tools – which include the Singapore Government Tech Stack and
commercially available Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions – also streamline
security compliance and promote interoperability.</p>
<h3>Simplifying governance to uplift industry’s delivery quality</h3>
<p>In response to industry feedback, the Government is trialling streamlined
compliance and procurement frameworks to reduce friction and uplift delivery
quality when working with the industry.</p>
<p>First, the Government is reviewing the stringent security requirements
that apply to low-risk government systems. This helps vendors work in a
more agile, cost-effective manner with the Government while ensuring that
requirements for critical systems remain robust. More information for vendors
is available on GovTech’s website, with the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/tech-standards" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>page</u></a> to be updated regularly
as the policy reform effort progresses. Tenders for which the streamlined
requirements will be in effect include the Cybersecurity and Audit Services
bulk tender, which involves the provision of cybersecurity risk assessments,
testing, and audit services.</p>
<p>Second, perpetual and dynamic contracting will also be introduced for
selected bulk tenders in FY24. Contracts under this new model will have
no end date and allow for the flexible addition of new vendors to ensure
the contracts remain competitive. This means that vendors who were previously
awarded a bulk tender and continue to meet the Government’s requirements
will not need to spend time and effort to re-apply when a contract expires.</p>
<p>Third, Tender Lite is a new tender category that removes the need for
certain contract clauses such as security deposits for performance and
is intended to improve businesses’ ease in transacting with the Government.
It was rolled out for general goods and services contracts from $90,000
to one million in value earlier this year, and the Government is seeking
feedback from industry on how best to do the same for ICT contracts.</p>
<h3>New event format to foster closer collaboration with industry</h3>
<p>The format for GovTech’s annual industry event has changed this year to
place greater emphasis on engagement with the industry. Renamed ‘Industry
Engagement’ from ‘Industry Briefing’, this year’s event introduces five
closed-door discussions with industry on a variety of topics. These include
soliciting feedback on compliance and procurement regulations, and the
Government’s wider digital government strategy.</p>
<p>Mr Goh Wei Boon, Chief Executive, GovTech, said: “The dynamic nature of
today’s technological and social landscape requires the Government to be
more agile. Engaging our industry partners allows us to tap the complementary
strengths of the public and private sectors, and I hope this close partnership
will ensure a smooth journey together on the next bound of Smart Nation.”</p>
