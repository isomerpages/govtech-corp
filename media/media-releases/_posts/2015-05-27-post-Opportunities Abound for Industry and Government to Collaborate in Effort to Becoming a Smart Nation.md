<h3>Industry-Government collaborations to make Singapore a Smart Nation</h3>
<p>The Singapore Government is gearing up to build a Smart Nation to improve
the quality of life for our people. Resources are&nbsp;being invested&nbsp;into
building infocomm infrastructure, developing citizen-centric services and
enhancing overall cyber security within the government. In line with the
Smart Nation plans for better government service delivery, government agencies
will&nbsp;be leveraging on&nbsp;Agile development, cloud services and data
analytics, as well as emerging technologies like Internet of Things sensors
and robotics, to better anticipate and meet citizens‚Äô needs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs we&nbsp;move towards realising&nbsp;our Smart Nation vision, the Government
is actively engaging with citizens, businesses and the tech industry. We
seek to gain better insights into the kinds of applications&nbsp;that people&nbsp;need
and build new Digital Government capabilities to deliver great experiences
to them. This is also the time to invest in the infrastructure&nbsp;that
will be&nbsp;foundational to Smart Nation,‚Äù said Ms Jacqueline Poh, Managing
Director of IDA, at the annual Industry Briefing on Infocomm Initiatives
in the Public Sector.</p>
<p>She cited examples such as the OneService Mobile App,&nbsp;which was&nbsp;a
convenient way for the public to provide feedback on municipal issues and
MyResponder, a life-saving mobile application by SCDF, which leverages
location awareness to enable volunteers to assist with cardiac arrest cases.</p>
<p>She added that an enhanced SingPass will be introduced this year, including
2FA&nbsp;amongst&nbsp;other features.&nbsp;A&nbsp;new Corporate Pass will
be implemented for businesses and organisations to access multiple government
e-services more securely&nbsp;in 2016.</p>
<p>Enhancing cyber security within the Government is another&nbsp;key&nbsp;area
of focus. Ms Poh revealed that over the past two years, measures have been
taken to strengthen capabilities in monitoring and detecting cyber threats
through the Cyber Watch Centre (CWC) and Monitoring and Operations Command
Centre (MOCC), as well as securing government ICT infrastructure through
DDoS mitigation services and tighter access controls.</p>
<p>In building capabilities for a Digital Government, IDA will continue to
work with the industry and co-create solutions for Smart Nation. One initiative
is the Accreditation@IDA programme, which was launched in 2014 to assist
local technology companies in getting their innovative products and services
adopted by government agencies and other consumers. The programme seeks
to provide an independent third-party evaluation of the companies‚Äô claimed
product core functionalities and&nbsp;ability to deliver. To date, eight
companies&nbsp;like Deep&nbsp;Identity, Green Koncepts, InspireTech, Kai
Square, Latize, Tagit, Trakomatic and&nbsp;VKey&nbsp;have&nbsp;been accredited&nbsp;in&nbsp;areas
such as&nbsp;mobile security, enterprise analytics, video analytics and
energy management.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA Digital Government is one where we put citizens at the heart of service
development and delivery,‚Äù said Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Assistant Chief Executive
(Government Services), IDA,&nbsp;who was&nbsp;also speaking at the Industry
Briefing.&nbsp;This would signal a different approach&nbsp;towards&nbsp;developing
government digital services. ‚ÄúTo be nimble and responsive, the government
can no longer outsource applications development so extensively,&nbsp;but
seek to co-source solutions with industry‚Äù.</p>
<p>IDA is setting up a Centre of Excellence in software engineering and data
analytics&nbsp;in One-North.&nbsp;It has facilities for user research,
user experience testing, and consultancy services for government agencies
in developing services for citizens.&nbsp;It will&nbsp;be staffed&nbsp;by
a team of software engineers and data scientists and&nbsp;engender a culture
that is&nbsp;multi-disciplinary, innovative&nbsp;and collaborative.&nbsp;‚ÄúThe
Government must anticipate the needs of citizens through data analytics
and build up its own internal IT engineering and development capabilities
whilst engaging the best partners in the industry‚Äù, Mr Chan added.</p>
<p>Mr Chan said that the Government will continue to invest in ICT to realise
the Smart Nation vision and seek collaboration with the industry to build
capabilities and develop more citizen-centric services. It&nbsp;is projected&nbsp;that
S$2.2 billion worth of Infocomm tenders will&nbsp;be called&nbsp;in the
financial year of 2015, with&nbsp;key&nbsp;areas of procurement focused
on digital and data services, web services, and Infocomm infrastructure,
as well as the development of the Smart Nation Platform.</p>
