<h3>Today, the government launched a five-year National Cyber Security Masterplan 2018 to secure Singapore‚Äôs cyber environment&nbsp;further.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Developed through a multi-agency effort led by IDA under the guidance
of the National Infocomm Security Committee (NISC), the master plan provides
an overarching strategic direction to help governments and organisations
strengthen resilience against cyber threats.</p>
<p>Announcing the launch at the Information Security Seminar 2013, Minister
for Communications and Information Dr Yaacob Ibrahim said, ‚ÄúAdopting a
collaborative approach across the public, private and people sectors, the
Masterplan will enhance the security of Singapore‚Äôs critical infocomm infrastructure
and address the security of businesses and individuals.&nbsp;This&nbsp;will
create a&nbsp;truly&nbsp;robust infocomm ecosystem and improve our quality
of life.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Masterplan will focus on three key areas to develop Singapore as a
trusted and robust infocomm hub by 2018. First, it will enhance the security
and resilience of critical infocomm infrastructure, which includes conducting
new cross-sector exercises to improve the overall resilience of infrastructure
and services. Second, efforts will&nbsp;be increased&nbsp;to promote infocomm
security adoption among end-users and businesses by leveraging publicity
channels and collaborating with industry and trade associations. The last
key area is to grow Singapore‚Äôs pool of infocomm security experts through
working with Institutes of Higher Learning and industry partners in training
and developing more students and professionals in infocomm security.</p>
<p>The Masterplan succeeds both Infocomm Security Masterplan and Infocomm
Security Masterplan 2,&nbsp;which were&nbsp;implemented from 2005 to 2012.
These previous masterplans had put in place capabilities that enhanced
situational awareness and risk mitigation&nbsp;through the setup of&nbsp;a
Cyber-Watch Centre and Threat Analysis Centre. The rollout of the Secure
and Resilient Internet Infrastructure Code of Practice resulted in Singapore
being among the first countries for designated ISPs to adopt mandatory
cyber security measures.&nbsp;The previous master plans also established
the Cyber Security Awareness Alliance to generate infocomm security awareness,
as well as&nbsp;the Association of Information Security Professionals to
develop local infocomm professionals.</p>
<p>Mr Lim Chuan Poh, Chairman of NISC said, ‚ÄúThe cyber security landscape
is rapidly evolving and we must sustain and step up our efforts to meet
the challenges posed by&nbsp;the&nbsp;increasingly sophisticated cyber
threats. Over the next five years, the National Cyber Security Masterplan
will guide our efforts to raise the capability and level of preparedness
in the public, private and people sectors to better respond to and manage
these cyber threats.‚Äù</p>
<p>Apart from the Masterplan launch,&nbsp;Singapore‚Äôs 3rd Annual Cyber Security
Awareness Day was also commemorated&nbsp;today. Championed by the Cyber
Security Awareness Alliance (Alliance) jointly led by the Infocomm Development
Authority of Singapore and the Singapore&nbsp;infocomm&nbsp;Technology
Federation, the theme of this year‚Äôs nationwide call-to-action is ‚ÄúSecurity
at Home and in the Workplace‚Äù. The Awareness Day continues to raise infocomm
security awareness and remind everyone of the need for personal and workplace
responsibility by adopting simple practices to secure their online identity,
computers, mobile and wireless devices.</p>
<p>As part of the Alliance‚Äôs efforts to promote public awareness and adoption,
a new mobile application will be launched by end 2013. The application
will contain features such as password strength checker and alerts&nbsp;pertaining
to&nbsp;infocomm security, threats and patches.</p>
