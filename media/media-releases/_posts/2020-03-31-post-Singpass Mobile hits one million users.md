<p><em>98 per cent of all 2FA transactions done via SingPass Mobile or SMS 2FA OneKey token to be decommissioned in 2021</em>
</p>
<p>As of March 2020, the number of SingPass Mobile (SPM) users has surpassed
one million.</p>
<p>Launched in October 2018, SPM provides a secure and convenient way for
users to access government digital services from over 60 agencies using
fingerprint, face recognition or a 6-digit passcode. Users can also view
their MyInfo Profile, perform in-person identity verification via QR code,
and access commonly used digital services through shortcuts.</p>
<p>Apart from government services, SPM also allows users to log in to selected
private sector services. To date, 16 private organisations offer SPM Login
to their customer portals. These include NTUC Income, NTUC U, AIA, Manulife,
Prudential, and the grants portal on the Singapore National Employers Federation
website. More private sector organisations will enable SPM Login in the
coming year.</p>
<p><strong>OneKey token to be phased out by 31 March 2021</strong>
</p>
<p>To date, 3.5 million SingPass users have activated their two-factor authentication
(2FA). 2FA is used for secure digital transactions and consists of a two-step
login. There are three methods for 2FA. Users can use SPM, or key in a
one-time PIN sent via SMS (SMS 2FA) or key in a one-time PIN generated
on a physical OneKey token. Currently, 98 per cent of 2FA logins to government
services use SPM or SMS 2FA, and only 2 per cent use OneKey token.</p>
<p>Due to the low usage, and the availability of alternative 2FA methods,
the issuance and replacement of OneKey tokens will cease from 1 October
2020. From 1 April 2021, users will not be able to use OneKey tokens to
access digital services.</p>
<p>During this transition period from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, users
are encouraged to refer to the <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/singpass-guides" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">instructional guides</a> on
how to set up their SPM app. Users who need further assistance can still
visit any of the <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/singpass-counters" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">46 SingPass counters</a> island-wide.</p>
<p>For citizens with mobile phones that are unable to download apps, they
can still set up and use SMS 2FA to continue accessing online services.</p>
<p>Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive of GovTech, said, ‚ÄúThe SingPass Mobile
app is key to Singapore‚Äôs national digital identity initiative. We are
encouraged by the strong support so far and will do more to promote the
use of the app, so that more users can transact online with the government
and the private sector easily and conveniently. We will also work with
our partner agencies to help more citizens learn how to use SingPass Mobile,
and continue to find new solutions which ensure security and convenience
for our citizens.‚Äù</p>
<p>GovTech will be working closely with the Infocomm Media Development Authority
(IMDA) and People‚Äôs Association to assist citizens during the transition.
Citizens, including seniors, can sign up for IT classes conducted at selected
community clubs / centres and IMDA‚Äôs Silver Infocomm Junctions to learn
how to use SPM to access government digital services. Please visit IMSilver.sg
