<h3>Streamlined process for opening bank accounts with MyInfo users</h3>
<p>The Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) and Government
Technology Agency (GovTech), in collaboration with the Monetary Authority
of Singapore (MAS), have begun a pilot with four banks to explore simplifying
online banking transactions with the use of the Government‚Äôs MyInfo service.</p>
<p>Starting progressively from today, prospective customers of United Overseas
Bank (UOB), Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corporation (OCBC) and Standard Chartered Bank (StanChart) with a registered
profile on myinfo.gov.sg can apply for a new bank account without needing
to submit supporting documentation. This enables greater convenience and
a faster transaction time, creating a seamless digital user experience.
In addition, the banks benefit from higher productivity and lower compliance
costs.</p>
<p>Banks currently require users to submit copies of their identity, income
and CPF documents for applications. With MyInfo, customers can pre-fill
these Government-verified personal particulars into the necessary forms,
and avoid the need to submit supporting documents.</p>
<p>MyInfo has been rolled out for SingPass users since May 2016 for popular
government digital services such as balloting of the Housing Development
Board‚Äôs Build-To-Order (BTO) flats. MyInfo will be available on most government
digital services with SingPass two-factor authentication (2FA) by 2018.</p>
<p>Jacqueline Poh, Chief Executive, GovTech, said, ‚ÄúWe want to explore how
citizen-centric government digital services can be extended to better help
industry and transform service-delivery to citizens. We have seen good
take-up of MyInfo, and hope that this public-private collaboration will
provide citizens with even more benefits.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer, MAS, said: ‚ÄúMAS is excited by
the opportunities that national infrastructure platforms can bring to the
financial industry, such as hassle-free online account opening and instant
account activation in the near future. MAS would like to urge the industry
to reimagine their customer journey for instant gratification as they leverage
platforms like MyInfo.‚Äù</p>
<p>This bank pilot illustrates how the Government can work with companies
and extend the use of a platform built for Digital Government to create
even greater value and convenience in a Smart Nation. After this pilot,
MyInfo may be extended later this year to other popular transactions such
as applications for credit cards and home loans. MyInfo could also be extended
to other sectors with strong citizen touch points such as insurance.</p>
