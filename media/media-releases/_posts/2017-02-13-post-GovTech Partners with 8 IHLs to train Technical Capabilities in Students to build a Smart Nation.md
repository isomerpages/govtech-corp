<p>The Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) announced the
signing of six individual Memorandums of Understanding (MOU), and two Memorandums
of Intent (MOI) with eight Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) today.</p>
<p>These agreements between GovTech and each IHL will share a common goal
‚Äì to develop the technology ecosystem by enhancing the capabilities and
competencies of the students, IHLs, and commercial entities through opportunities
offered by the public sector to work on smart technologies.</p>
<h3>Providing Hands-on Opportunities for over 300 Students</h3>
<p>GovTech aims to provide training opportunities for over 300 students,
through these agreements. GovTech will provide students exposure through
internships, attachments, final-year projects, and tech-related competitions
in which they will work on technological solutions for problems faced by
public agencies. Students will also be invited to seminars, workshops and
courses organised by GovTech. They will work on areas including cyber security,
data analytics, internet-of-things and other emerging technologies. Such
work exposure aims to complement the recent Committee on the Future Economy
recommendations for young workers to attain deep skills and industry-relevant
expertise in order to give them an edge in a technology driven future.</p>
<p>The IHLs (in alphabetical order) are:</p>

<p>Singapore University of Technology and Design</p>

<li>
<p>Temasek Polytechnic</p>

</ul>
<h3>Integrating the IHLs into the Current Partnership Ecosystem</h3>
<p>GovTech will continue to tap on its current InnoLeap programme, which
provides platforms for IHLs, Research Institutes (RIs) and commercial entities
to work together to transform challenges faced by public agencies into
innovative solutions in a technology ecosystem. The sharing of such challenges
is carried out through thematic workshops, sharing sessions and one-to-one
consultation clinics. Since its launch in August 2014, InnoLeap has conducted
21 sessions, involving about 1,000 participants from over 70 organisations
and close to 90 public agencies. GovTech will work closely with these eight
IHLs in the subsequent sessions.</p>
<p>Ms Jacqueline Poh, Chief Executive, GovTech, said, ‚ÄúWe believe that an
active partnership between public agencies, academia and commercial entities
can help us create the best digital services for citizens and smart solutions
for our city. This set of agreements will not only give us the opportunity
to do that, but also allow us to help develop our next generation of tech
talent, which is key to building Singapore into a Smart Nation. ‚Äù</p>
