<h3>Information Society (WSIS) Prizes 2017</h3>
<p>The National Trade Platform (NTP) project led by Singapore Customs and
the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) has emerged as the winner in
the e-business category of the World Summit on the Information Society
(WSIS) Prizes 2017 <sup>[1]</sup>
</p>
<p>The WSIS Prizes recognise outstanding digital projects <sup>[2]</sup> worldwide
which foster socio-economic development across categories such as e-government,
e-environment, e-science and media. The winners of the 18 categories were
announced on 13 Jun 2017 at the annual WSIS Forum held in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p>This is the first time that a digital initiative from Singapore has won
in any of the 18 categories of the WSIS Prizes since the inception of these
prizes in 2012. The NTP beat four other projects to come up tops in the
e-business category. Receiving the award for the NTP were Mr Ho Chee Pong,
Director-General, Singapore Customs, and Mr Tan Eng Pheng, Senior Director
(Clusters Group), GovTech.</p>
<p>Currently being developed, the NTP ‚Äì which will replace the existing TradeNet¬Æ <sup>[3]</sup> and
TradeXchange¬Æ systems ‚Äì is a one-stop next-generation trade information
management platform to support companies in the trade and logistics industry
and adjacent sectors such as trade finance. The NTP will be progressively
rolled out from end-2017.</p>
<p>The NTP will help businesses to streamline work processes, reduce inefficiencies
of manual trade document exchange, and leverage data analytics for insights
from their trade data, so as to be well-equipped for the digital economy.</p>
<p>In August 2016, the NTP was also conferred the best Smart City Project
under the Economic Development category of the International Data Corporation‚Äôs
(IDC) 2016 Smart City/Asia Pacific Awards (SCAPA).</p>
<p>Please refer to Annex A for a quote from the CEO &amp; Founder, CommGate.</p>
<p><sup>[1]</sup> The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) is a
global summit under the United Nations (UN) that seeks to build a people-centric,
inclusive and development-oriented Information Society. The WSIS Prizes
is an international contest to evaluate and recognise individuals, governments,
civil society, local, regional and international agencies, research institutions
and private-sector companies for outstanding success in implementing development-oriented
strategies that leverage on ICT as an enabler of development.</p>
<p><sup>[2]</sup> The four other projects are ‚ÄúeTrade for All‚Äù from Switzerland,
‚ÄúLABORA‚Äù from Mexico, ‚ÄúIntelligent Waiter Robot‚Äù from Pakistan and ‚ÄúOnline
Administrative Executive Service‚Äù from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><sup>[3]</sup> TradeNet¬Æ was launched in 1989. It is Singapore‚Äôs single
trade permit clearing house, incorporating Whole-Of-Government (WOG) trade
regulatory requirements. Through TradeNet¬Æ, importers, exporters and freight
forwarders can make B2G transactions such as the declaration of permits.
TradeXchange¬Æ was launched in 2007. It is a secure and neutral IT platform
which enables exchanges of trade and logistics documents and data amongst
private sector companies, as well as with the Government.</p>
