<p>5G@Sentosa testbed aims to catalyse large-scale adoption of 5G by government
agencies and develop Singapore’s 5G eco-system ahead of nationwide 5G rollout
in 2025</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Building and Construction Authority and National Environment Agency
are among the first government agencies to leverage low latency 5G for
trials involving fully autonomous robots, tele-operated vehicles, and augmented
reality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sentosa will serve as a testbed for promising public sector use cases
that could be rolled out on the mainland in the next five years, with the
first batch of trials already underway. The 5G@Sentosa programme was announced
by Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of
Smart Nation and Cybersecurity Mrs Josephine Teo.</p>
<p>5G@Sentosa is a public-private sector collaboration led by the Government
Technology Agency (GovTech), the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC),
and Singtel. The testbed catalyses the public sector’s adoption of 5G connectivity
ahead of the nationwide 5G rollout in 2025 by enabling agencies to trial
use cases that improve operational effectiveness and deliver citizen-centric
services. 5G will also enhance GovTech’s Smart Nation Sensor Platform,
facilitating agencies’ gathering and processing of sensor data in real-time,
and opening up new operational possibilities in areas such as urban planning
and traffic management. Singtel plays an important role with its purpose-built
network and edge cloud infrastructure in Sentosa supporting 5G application
rollout on a mass scale, while Sentosa provides a unique environment as
an ecosystem of leisure experiences and businesses for organisations to
study and trial the viability of innovative prototypes and solutions.</p>
<p>A total of 10 trials have started, leveraging the lower latency, higher
speed, and broader bandwidth of 5G technology for use cases in areas such
as construction, manufacturing, healthcare and tourism. The Building and
Construction Authority (BCA), the National Environment Agency (NEA), the
Centre for Healthcare Assistive and Robotics Technologies (CHART) at Changi
General Hospital, Nanyang Polytechnic, and the Agency for Science, Technology
and Research’s (A*STAR’s) Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) are among
the first wave of agencies participating in 5G@Sentosa. SDC will also partner
the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in trialling infrastructure-light 5G
leisure experiences in Sentosa, which could potentially be adopted by Singapore’s
tourism industry. The Government aims to have 15 live trials by public
agencies running in Sentosa by the end of the year, and at least 30 by
the first half of 2023.</p>
<p>“5G is a key component of the SNSP that allows us to tap the full potential
of sensors and IoT systems to facilitate the real-time sharing of operational
data, generate new insights, and deliver better citizen-centric public
services. 5G@Sentosa gives GovTech a platform to work with agencies and
industry to co-create solutions for the public sector,” said GovTech Chief
Executive Kok Ping Soon. “We are encouraged by agencies’ recognition of
5G as an emerging technology with the potential to unlock new Smart Nation
applications and look forward to supporting more trials at 5G@Sentosa.”</p>
<p>BCA is currently working with Gammon Pte Ltd, the builder of the North-South
Link Project in Sentosa, to trial the use of 5G for construction applications.
This includes deploying fully autonomous robots with mounted 3D laser scanners
for remote tracking of work progress, leveraging augmented reality technology
for real-time quality control on building installations, and using drones
with live video feeds for site inspection.</p>
<p>Said Dr Tan Kee Wee, Programme Director of the Digitalisation department
in BCA, “5G technology has opened up many possibilities for the Built Environment
sector to further leverage robotics and automation. Such applications typically
require a large amount of data to be transmitted in real-time which 5G
would be able to support. We are excited to see the results of these trials
on how 5G technology can improve site productivity and safety, transforming
the way we build. We hope to partner more built environment firms to trial
such 5G capabilities to improve their digital site management capabilities.”</p>
<p>The NEA is working with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to trial
the tele-operation of the Autonomous Environmental Service Vehicle for
road-sweeping. 5G's high bandwidth and low latency are beneficial for streaming
live camera feeds from the vehicle to the off-site operator, as well as
transmitting haptic feedback and vehicular commands. These trials would
enable an off-site operator to play the role of the on-board safety driver,
a current requirement for Autonomous Vehicle (AV) trials, in the eventual
deployment of AVs on public roads.</p>
<p>Mr Bill Chang, Chief Executive Officer, Group Enterprise at Singtel said,
“The trials at Sentosa are the big ramp up in public sector use cases after
the launch of Singtel’s islandwide 5G Standalone network. Our common vision
with GovTech, Sentosa, and the partnering agencies is to accelerate and
develop an exciting 5G eco-system. Singtel’s 5G network and Multi-Access
Edge Compute is enabling the deployment of low-latency, business-critical
applications, allowing agencies to trial the use of 5G-powered drones and
robots, deployment of teleops as well as advanced data analytics capabilities
easily and efficiently. What you have seen today is a sampling of what
5G can achieve, and we welcome more agencies, businesses and eco-system
partners to come on board.”</p>
<p>Mr Michael Ma, Assistant Chief Executive, SDC, said, “Being a leading
leisure destination, we are constantly on the lookout for new and innovative
ways to deepen our engagement with guests and create great experiences.
The range of 5G trials will play an important role in identifying opportunities
where infrastructure-light 5G technology can be leveraged not only to achieve
greater productivity and efficiency in SDC’s management of the Sentosa
precinct, such as in transport, security, and cleaning operations, but
also to enhance Singapore’s tourism offerings, including Sentosa’s range
of unique leisure experiences. Such offerings could include edutainment
featuring immersive 5G augmented reality (AR) experiences at Sentosa’s
nature and heritage trails. We are pleased to partner STB to trial the
gamification of the Fort Siloso area, with a joint technical study to begin
by the end of this year.”</p>
