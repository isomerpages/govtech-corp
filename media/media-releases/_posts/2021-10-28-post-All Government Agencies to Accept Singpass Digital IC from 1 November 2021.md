<p>Singapore, 28 October 2021</p><p>All Government agencies will accept, from 1 November 2021, the Digital Identity Card (IC) on the Singpass app as an alternative means to prove an individual’s identity for in-person agency services. This marks a significant milestone for Smart Nation, in which people can tap on this proof of identification to transact digitally with public and private sector entities.</p><p>Singpass, our trusted national digital identity, provides a convenient and secure platform for users to transact with the Government and other private sector service providers. Today, 97% of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged 15 years old and above have Singpass accounts, making it one of the most pervasively adopted national digital identity systems in the world. There are over 3.2 million Singpass app users, and about 300 million personal and corporate Singpass transactions[1] every year.</p><h3><strong>All Government agencies to accept Digital IC, except for instances when physical document is required under the legislation</strong></h3><p>With the wider acceptance of Digital IC by the Government, Singpass app users can confidently and conveniently prove their identity using the Digital IC when transacting at Government counters, polyclinics and public libraries. This means that users will no longer need to bring their physical IC, except in a few instances[2], e.g., when the legislation requires a physical identity document such as for marriage registrations and hotel check-ins. We are working on amending the legislation to formalise the use of Digital IC for these exceptions.</p><h3><strong>Enhancements to the Digital IC feature in Singpass app</strong></h3><p>The Digital IC feature was introduced in the Singpass app in May 2020. To enhance the user experience, we have improved the user interface in the Singpass app. The Digital IC feature is now displayed prominently on the homepage, making it easy for users to access. The public is encouraged to update their Singpass app to the latest version to enjoy the improved features. Screenshots of the new app interface can be found in Annex A.</p><p>As the Digital IC serves as an official identification document, security measures are in place to protect the user’s identity. The Digital IC features the user’s latest photograph provided to the Government and is accompanied by an animated and holographic lion crest to prevent image tampering and screenshot spoofing. In addition, users’ NRIC numbers or FIN are masked by default to protect their privacy during transactions, and user authentication is required to view the full details on the Digital IC.</p><p>Currently, the Digital IC is also accepted by service providers such as SingHealth Polyclinics and we hope to onboard more private sector companies to do so, to encourage the use of the Digital IC as a way of life in Smart Nation Singapore.</p><hr><p>[1] Since April 2021, Corppass users must verify their identities using Singpass before they can access and transact with participating digital services on behalf of their companies. <br>[2] Other instances include the change management needed across various agencies.</p><hr><p><strong>For media enquiries, please contact:</strong></p><p>Chia Suat Ning (Ms) <br>Manager, Adoption and Engagement Directorate <br>Smart Nation and Digital Government Office, Prime Minister’s Office <br>Tel: 8182 8052 <br>Email: <a href="mailto:CHIA_Suat_Ning@pmo.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CHIA_Suat_Ning@pmo.gov.sg</a></p><p>Serene Chan (Ms) <br>Manager, Communications and Marketing Group <br>Government Technology Agency <br>Tel: 9729 9392 <br>Email: <a href="mailto:Serene_CHAN@tech.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Serene_CHAN@tech.gov.sg</a></p><hr><h4>Annex A - Screenshots of the Singpass app’s New Interface</h4><p><strong>A Digital IC in your pocket, for all Singapore Residents</strong> <br><em>Familiar and easily recognisable coloured cards</em></p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Citizen</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Permanent Resident</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Long Term Pass Holder[3]</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Singapore citizen Singpass digital IC profile" src="/images/media-release/Citizen_All_Government_Agencies_to_Accept_Singpass_Digital_IC_from_1_November_2021_.png"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Permanent Resident Singpass digital IC profile" src="/images/media-release/All_Government_Agencies_to_Accept_Singpass_Digital_IC_from_1_November_2021__1_.png"></div></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Long Term pass holder Singpass digital IC profile" src="/images/media-release/LT_All_Government_Agencies_to_Accept_Singpass_Digital_IC_from_1_November_2021_.png"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Note: Singpass displays the user’s latest photograph provided to the Government on the Digital IC, providing a higher accuracy when comparing likeness in person.</p><p><strong>Singpass app, with a new look</strong> <br><em>The same features you love, just easier and better</em></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Singpass app with a new look and user interface" src="/images/media-release/All_Government_Agencies_to_Accept_Singpass_Digital_IC_from_1_November_2021__2_.jpg"></div><p><strong>Your privacy is protected</strong> <br><em>Access more details on your Digital IC by tapping on the card and verifying your identity</em></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Barcode authentication feature on the Singpass app" src="/images/media-release/All_Government_Agencies_to_Accept_Singpass_Digital_IC_from_1_November_2021__3_.jpg"></div><p>[3] Only work pass holders have the fields “Employer” and “Sector”</p><p><strong>Related Resources</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Media Factsheet on Singpass (National Digital Identity)</a></p></li></ul><hr><p></p>
