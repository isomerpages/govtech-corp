<h3>Provision of&nbsp;30-day&nbsp;grace period to end on 15 January 2017</h3>
<p>Over 2.3 million SingPass users have set up their SingPass 2-Step Verification,
also known as 2-Factor Authentication (2FA),&nbsp;to better protect their
SingPass account and personal data.</p>
<p>SingPass 2FA was made mandatory in July 2016, following a year of extensive
outreach. To minimise disruption to regular users who need to transact
with government agencies urgently, users who have not set up their 2FA
are given a one-time grace period of 30 days upon their first login to
SingPass in July to do so.</p>
<p>The majority of the SingPass users are now 2FA-ready. The provision of
the 30-day grace period will,&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;end on&nbsp;<strong>15 January 2017</strong>&nbsp;(refer
to Annex for details).&nbsp;This&nbsp;means that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Users who log in to SingPass&nbsp;<strong>before or on 15 January 2017</strong>&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;<strong>given&nbsp;the&nbsp;full&nbsp;30-day</strong>&nbsp;grace
period to complete their 2FA setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users who log in to SingPass&nbsp;<strong>from 16 January 2017</strong>&nbsp;onwards&nbsp;<strong>will not&nbsp;be given</strong>&nbsp;any
grace period to complete their 2FA setup, which will take up to seven and&nbsp;10&nbsp;working
days for local and overseas users, respectively. They will need to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Log in to their SingPass account and click “Set Up 2-Step Verification”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait&nbsp;for a PIN mailer to arrive at their registered address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the PIN mailer to activate 2FA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Users&nbsp;need to complete their SingPass 2FA setup&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to
file taxes&nbsp;from 2017 onwards,&nbsp;and access over 100 government
digital services involving sensitive data.</p>
<p>Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Government Chief Information Officer, GovTech, said,
“Having&nbsp;a majority of&nbsp;SingPass users on-board 2FA is a significant
step towards improving personal online security and creating a safer cyberspace.
For users who have not set up their SingPass 2FA, we strongly encourage
them to do so&nbsp;to better protect their personal data.”</p>
<p>For enquiries regarding SingPass 2FA setup, users can refer to the 2FA
FAQs and Video Guides.&nbsp;They can also&nbsp;contact Assurity Helpdesk
