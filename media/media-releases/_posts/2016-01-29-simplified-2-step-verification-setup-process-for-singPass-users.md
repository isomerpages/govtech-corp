SingPass users can now set up their 2-Step Verification (2FA) with greater ease and convenience.

As part of on-going enhancements to the SingPass system, the 2FA setup process has been simplified such that users only need to do the following:

* Log into their SingPass account and click “Set Up 2-Step Verification (2FA)” under the Quick Links section
* Register for SMS or OneKey token via the SingPass website – after which, a pin mailer that contains an activation code will be sent to their registered address
* Send the activation code to 78111 via SMS, or log into Assurity’s website, to activate their 2FA

To confirm that they have set up their 2FA, users can log into their SingPass account, click “My Account”, followed by “Manage 2-Step Verification”. If they have not set up their 2FA, they will be prompted to do so.

From 5th July 2016, over 100 government e-services by agencies, such as MOM, CPF, IRAS and ACRA, will require 2FA to perform e-transactions. This means that in addition to their SingPass username and password, users will need to enter a One-Time Password (OTP) sent via SMS or generated through a OneKey token.

If users do not set up their SingPass 2FA:

* They will not be able to perform sensitive government e-transactions, such as IRAS tax filing and accessing CPF statements
* They will need to wait for up to seven working days for a pin mailer to activate their 2FA before they can perform sensitive e-transactions

Ms Jacqueline Poh, Managing Director, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, said, "We are consistently improving our e-services to ensure that they are as user-friendly as possible, without compromising security, such as enabling users to activate their 2FA via SMS. We encourage all users to set up their SingPass 2FA early so that they can continue to perform their government e-transactions safely and without any disruption.”
