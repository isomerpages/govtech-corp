<p>SINGAPORE, 10 Nov 2017 ‚Äì Businesses and developers can now offer&nbsp;simpler&nbsp;and
hassle-free digital services&nbsp;to their customers&nbsp;by tapping on
the government‚Äôs MyInfo service.&nbsp;Launched today, the MyInfo Developer
&amp; Partner Portal, as the next step towards building a vibrant ecosystem
for the National Digital Identity (NDI), provides businesses with the necessary
resources to integrate their digital services with MyInfo.</p>
<p>This move sets Singapore apart as one of the first governments in the
world to enable businesses to access consent-driven citizen data for easier
integration into their applications.&nbsp;This is in line&nbsp;with the
Smart Nation objectives of facilitating greater collaboration between the
Government and private&nbsp;sector,&nbsp;to create better efficiencies
for businesses and a more intuitive user experience for their customers.</p>
<p>The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) is introducing this portal
on the back of the well-received MyInfo bank pilot. The earlier pilot has
helped bank users&nbsp;do away with&nbsp;the need to submit supporting
documents, such as NRIC scans or proof of address, ensuring greater convenience
and faster transaction times when opening new bank accounts and applying
for credit cards. Banks also reported an average decrease of up to 80 per
cent in application time for their customers, with some seeing up to 15
per cent higher approval rate due to MyInfo‚Äôs better data quality. Verified
data streamlines business&nbsp;processes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been observing how citizens transact with&nbsp;government,&nbsp;and
what it takes to reduce the hassle on their part. With MyInfo made available
to a wider range of business transactions, we can help remove the need
to verify&nbsp;documents,&nbsp;and even reduce time spent on face-to-face
meetings.&nbsp;This&nbsp;significantly improves business efficiency as
companies can&nbsp;on-board&nbsp;their customers faster.‚Äù</p>

<p>~ Chan Cheow Hoe, Government Chief Information Officer, GovTech</p>
<p>Chan Cheow Hoe, Government Chief Information Officer, GovTech, said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve
been observing how citizens transact with&nbsp;government,&nbsp;and what
it takes to reduce the hassle on their part. With MyInfo made available
to a wider range of business transactions, we can help remove the need
to verify&nbsp;documents,&nbsp;and even reduce time spent on face-to-face
meetings.&nbsp;This&nbsp;significantly improves business efficiency as
companies can&nbsp;on-board&nbsp;their customers faster.‚Äù</p>
<p>The provision of&nbsp;government-verified digital data also ensures greater
accuracy in the information provided to the companies. The security and
privacy of citizen data remains a&nbsp;key&nbsp;priority, similar&nbsp;to
the bank pilot, businesses will need to seek consent from customers at
the point of every transaction before any data&nbsp;is released&nbsp;for
their use. Keen interest from industry Following news of the bank pilot,
GovTech has received strong interest from more than 100 businesses in various
business sectors&nbsp;including&nbsp;telecommunications, utilities, banking
and finance&nbsp;on&nbsp;how they can tap on MyInfo for faster transactions
with their customers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are very excited to use MyInfo to deliver frictionless, cashless transactions
for&nbsp;both&nbsp;consumers and merchants. The MyInfo platform will optimise
the&nbsp;onboarding&nbsp;process of our hawker partners by streamlining
KYC documentation and verification, enabling them to quickly and easily
accept e-money. This is in line with Smart Nation&nbsp;and&nbsp;we are
pleased to be part of the rapidly evolving cashless payments ecosystem,‚Äù
said Jeremy Tan, founder and CEO of Liquid Group.</p>
<p>The portal will also benefit developers as it offers a sandbox environment&nbsp;for
them&nbsp;to build solutions faster. Locally-registered businesses can
log in with their CorpPass credentials from December 2017 onwards.</p>
<h3>What is MyInfo?</h3>
<p>MyInfo is a service for SingPass users to manage the use of their&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data
when transacting online with participating government agencies and commercial
entities. MyInfo users can skip filling in personal data repeatedly for
every digital transaction while enjoying greater convenience from producing
fewer verification documents.&nbsp;MyInfo was extended to the banking sector
in May 2017, with four banks piloting&nbsp;the use of MyInfo for the opening
of&nbsp;new bank accounts and&nbsp;application of&nbsp;credit cards.</p>
