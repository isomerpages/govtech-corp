<p>In line with our vision to become a Smart Nation, the Government is developing
a digital parking mobile application to allow motorists to pay parking
charges through their mobile devices.</p>
<p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Housing &amp; Development
Board (HDB), in partnership with the Government Technology Agency of Singapore
(GovTech), are developing a mobile application for motorists to use at
public car parks that currently use paper coupons.</p>
<p>The mobile app will provide more convenience for motorists as they need
not return to their vehicles to add more coupons to extend their parking
session. The benefits of the app include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Paying for parking digitally:</strong> Motorists can use the app
to key in their vehicle number, select the car park, indicate their parking
duration and start parking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calculating parking charges automatically:</strong> The app automatically
calculates the charges that motorists have to pay based on their parking
duration on a per-minute basis. A refund will be given if motorists choose
to end their parking session earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extending parking session remotely:</strong> The app allows motorists
to track the validity of their parking session. They can extend the duration
of their parking session at their own time and convenience. A trial will
be conducted among public sector officers from May to June 2017 to test
the functionalities of the app at selected public car parks in the city
area. During this period, we will test the app, especially the payment
module, to be confident of its robustness before we extend the trial to
the general public. With the feedback gathered from the trial, the agencies
will improve the app for better user experience. Please refer to Annex
A for the list of participating public car parks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan is to extend the trial to members of the public later this year.
More details of the public trial will be announced later.</p>
<p>As part of our Smart Nation and Digital Government efforts, the Government
will continually experiment with new ways of using technology to improve
the quality of lives of citizens. This will involve taking in user feedback
early in the product development cycle through various trials and enhancing
the product with new features along the way. This agile and iterative way
of developing government digital products will enable the Government to
push out innovations to benefit citizens quicker.</p>
