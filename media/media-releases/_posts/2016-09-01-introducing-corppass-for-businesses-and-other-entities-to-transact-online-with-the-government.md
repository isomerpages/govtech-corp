The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) <sup>[1]</sup> announced today that Singapore Corporate Access (CorpPass) will be launched on 15 September 2016. CorpPass will be a new corporate digital identity for businesses and other entities (such as non-profit organisations and associations) to transact with Government agencies online.

Businesses currently conduct business transactions through multiple digital identities such as SingPass and EASY <sup>[2]</sup>. Having a single corporate digital identity will increase convenience for users who transact with multiple government agencies as they no longer need to handle multiple login IDs. CorpPass will also allow businesses to have greater control, as they will be able to grant and manage employees’ access to Government digital services.

The Government has also received feedback from the business community that SingPass should only be used for personal transactions, not corporate transactions, due to privacy concerns. For example, employees who go on leave tend to share their personal SingPass ID and passwords with colleagues to help perform business transactions like filing corporate tax, or applying for permits and licences. Having separate login IDs for corporate and personal matters will therefore better protect information of both businesses and employees. 

Developed in consultation with industry partners and pilot users, CorpPass will be progressively rolled out from September 2016 to December 2017. More Government digital services will be added in each phase, with Phase One introducing services from the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore, Ministry of Trade and Industry, National Environment Agency, and Singapore Customs. Please refer to the **Annex 1** for list of digital services available from September 2016. 

Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Assistant Chief Executive, IDA, said, “CorpPass marks the first time that the Government is rolling out a single corporate digital identity. This creates opportunities for even more services and transactions to be provided online conveniently and securely. More than 1,500 business users have successfully registered and activated their CorpPass accounts since our trial started in April this year. We encourage businesses to sign up early for CorpPass as this will be a required login method for most Government digital services by end of next year.”

Mr Lau Tai San, Vice-President, SCCCI said, “The implementation of CorpPass will help businesses complete their business administrative process more efficiently. It will enhance security, data protection and privacy.  We will work closely with the Government to reach out to our members by creating awareness of this new portal for business users through various activities.” 

Mr Kelvin Tan, Senior Manager of Kim Hing Food Industries which specialises in the manufacturing and packaging of premium food said, “As a senior manager tasked to handle B2G matters by my company, I was curious what this new Government portal can do for me, particularly in addressing my immediate concern of sharing my personal SingPass ID with staff handling the business transactions. After participating in the trial use of the system and giving feedback as a user to the CorpPass team, I am glad to know that the steps needed to register a CorpPass account are simple and it has addressed my concern of data privacy.”
 
For information regarding CorpPass setup, users can visit www.corppass.gov.sg, or refer to CorpPass online guides. If additional assistance is required, users can contact the CorpPass Helpdesk at +65 6643 0577 (8am to 8pm on Mondays to Fridays, 8am to 2pm on Saturdays), via email support@corppass.gov.sg, or make an appointment to visit the CorpPass Business Centre.

<sup>[1]</sup> CorpPass is owned by the Ministry of Finance and managed by Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA). IDA will be restructured and Government Technology Agency (GovTech) will be formed on 1 October 2016. GovTech will manage CorpPass with effect from 1 October 2016. 

<sup>[2]</sup> E-Services Authorisation System (EASY) is an online digital service authorisation system currently used by some agencies including the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, JTC Corporation and the Immigration Checkpoints Authority of Singapore.
