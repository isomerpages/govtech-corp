<h3>SingPass new features</h3>
<p>From 5 July 2015 onwards, SingPass users can&nbsp;look forward to&nbsp;an
improved user interface, mobile-friendly features and stronger security
capabilities&nbsp;with the enhanced system.</p>
<p>The SingPass system has&nbsp;been enhanced&nbsp;to be easier and more
convenient&nbsp;to use, with&nbsp;clearer&nbsp;instructions and more intuitive
account management features, among other improvements. Users can better
navigate the site and complete their tasks efficiently, access their account
via mobile device, and update their SingPass account easily online, anytime,
anywhere.</p>
<p>In addition to improved usability features, security is a critical component
of the design of the enhanced system. Users will be able to receive SMS
or email notifications for any changes made to their profile so that they&nbsp;are&nbsp;always&nbsp;updated&nbsp;on
their account activities. They will also go through a secure 2-step login
process for e-government transactions involving sensitive data, such as
financial or health information, or those that require a high level of
identity assurance. These measures help to ensure that users‚Äô&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data
is better protected. To start with, more than 100 government e-services
will require 2-step verification. These include the more commonly used
e-services provided by MOM, CPFB and IRAS.</p>
<p>After the launch of the service on 5 July 2015, users will need to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Update their SingPass account</strong>&nbsp;by providing and verifying
their mobile number and email address, as well as&nbsp;setting up their
security questions and answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set up their 2-step verification</strong>&nbsp;by registering,
activating and linking their OneKey token or mobile number to their SingPass
account. ‚ÄúOver the years, the government has implemented over 200 e-services
online through SingPass&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;enable swift and convenient
transactions with the government. With the rise of cyber threats in Singapore
and globally, we have added security measures like multi-factor authentication
to protect SingPass users‚Äô&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data. We urge all users to
avoid using the same passwords for different purposes and to avoid sharing
their account information with others,‚Äù said Ms Jacqueline Poh, Managing
Director of the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore.</p>
