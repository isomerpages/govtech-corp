<p>In line with Singapore’s Smart Nation vision of catalysing innovation
and co-creation, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) will progressively
open-source the code&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;for the Beeline smart mobility platform
from October 2017. Industry and individual developers will be able to adopt,
build on and scale up the platform or develop new mobility solutions using
the code.</p>
<p>Jointly developed by GovTech and the Land Transport Authority (LTA), Beeline
is an open, cloud-based smart mobility platform&nbsp;providing&nbsp;data-driven
shuttle bus services for commuters.</p>
<p>Commuters can use the Beeline app to book seats on available private express
bus routes in advance. Should there be sufficient commuter demand for a
certain route, the route will automatically be activated. Beeline enables
private bus operators to provide shuttle bus services based on commuters’
demand and economic viability and use data analytics tools for fleet management
and operations.</p>
<p>Designed on an open architecture, Beeline enables private transport operators
and tech start-ups to easily build and integrate additional applications/functions,
providing more convenient transport options for commuters. Since its pilot
in 2015, seven private transport operators – including Grab (GrabShuttle),
BusPlus, Aedge Holdings and Woodlands Transport – are on the Beeline platform,
with more than 130 bus routes deployed on Beeline.</p>
<h3>Catalysing Innovative Mobility Solutions</h3>
<p>Jacqueline Poh, Chief Executive, of GovTech, said, “Getting people from
one place to another&nbsp;in an efficient and pleasant manner&nbsp;is a
challenge that all cities are facing. Smart urban mobility is a key component
of Singapore’s Smart Nation vision. Transport APIs have been made available
through the open data portal, <a href="https://github.com/datagovsg/beeline-frontend" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Data.gov.sg</a>, and
we have seen applications created out of such APIs. By open-sourcing Beeline,
we hope to catalyse innovative solutions, be it by commercial operators
or individual developers. We are inviting developers to improve our open-sourced
code and push out new features to the benefit of citizens at a faster pace.”</p>
<p>Chua U-Zyn, Founder of Zynesis, said, “Open-sourcing&nbsp;encourages open
innovation and collaboration between the public and Government – a true
quality of a Smart Nation, where anyone and everyone&nbsp;is able to&nbsp;contribute
to the public good. I applaud GovTech’s move to open-source Beeline, and
hope this would encourage more software companies and individuals in Singapore
to actively participate and open-source their work.”</p>
<p>The first set of Beeline code will be released on 1 October 2017, on GitHub,
at the following URLs:</p>
