<p>Following the formation of the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group
(SNDGG), the Government will accelerate Smart Nation deployment and digital
transformation, and further partner and co-create with the industry to
apply digital and smart technologies that improve the lives of citizens.</p>
<p>SNDGG, comprising the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO)
and the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), is leading the development
of Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and driving digital transformation
across the public sector. Together, SNDGG will be focusing on national
projects that include the National Digital Identity, cashless payments
with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Smart Nation Sensor
Platform (SNSP).</p>
<h4>Continued Investment in Data Analytics, Sensors, Robotics and Cybersecurity</h4>
<p>To support the momentum in our digitalisation efforts, the Government
will be calling for a projected $2.4 billion of ICT tenders in FY17 and
invest in technologies such as data analytics, sensors and related software
and systems. This will include a tender for data analytics and another
for communications infrastructure to link up data centres and IoT (Internet-of-Things)
sensors.</p>
<p>The Government will also be partnering the industry to increase the deployment
of robotics. For instance, Temasek Polytechnic will be looking for an industry
partner to build an inventory robot which will utilise RFID technology
to scan the print collection and navigate in its library. This will help
the library carry out more and faster inventory stocktakes to boost productivity
and efficiency, as well as provide early detection of missing or wrongly
shelved books. Such initiatives aim to provide a cost effective way to
automate simple repetitive tasks and improve productivity.</p>
<p>In addition, while the Government has put in place a range of measures
which minimises the likelihood of government systems being infected by
malware, it will continue to invest in cybersecurity to ensure that government
agencies are equipped with best cybersecurity practices and next-generation
technologies including advanced threat analytics and automation.</p>
<h4>SMEs Accounted for Close to Two-thirds of ICT Contracts in FY16</h4>
<p>Ms Jacqueline Poh, Chief Executive, GovTech, said, ‚ÄúWe will continue to
work with the industry and provide them with the foundational support to
build Singapore as a Smart Nation. On the other hand, companies will also
need to boost their ICT and engineering capabilities in order to keep up
with the fast-changing technological landscape.‚Äù</p>
<p>She added, ‚ÄúBesides the established companies, we are glad that there
is a growing pool of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that have stepped
up and embraced new technologies. Last year, SMEs accounted for about two-thirds
of the total number of ICT contracts awarded.‚Äù</p>
<p>An example of a local technology SME that was awarded ICT contracts last
year is DC Frontiers, a local technology company accredited by the Infocomm
Media Development Authority (IMDA). DC Frontiers offers an artificial intelligence
solution known as Handshakes, which analyses networks of connections between
people and companies to give users insights into, among other things, legal
ownership, conflicts of interest and possible fraud. Last year, it began
working with procurement and internal audit teams in the Government to
enhance and automate checks for conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Through the Accreditation@IMDA programme, promising ICT SMEs will be identified
and proactively involved in the Government‚Äôs digital transformation efforts.
To-date, companies under the programme have won more than 90 projects with
various Government agencies and are currently engaged in many more project
discussions.</p>
<p>These announcements were made at GovTech‚Äôs annual Smart Nation and Digital
Government Industry Briefing (IB), where GovTech provides updates on Government
strategies and business opportunities for the ICT industry. The event was
attended by about 1,000 attendees.</p>
<p>Several government agencies were also present at Smart Nation and Digital
Government IB to share their ICT procurement roadmap and future ICT plans
- Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and the Maritime and Port Authority
of Singapore.</p>
