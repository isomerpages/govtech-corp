<h3>More than eight in 10 businesses now using CorpPass</h3>
<p>More than 80 per cent of businesses that have regular transactions with
the Government have registered for and started using Singapore Corporate
Access (CorpPass), to better protect and manage their corporate data. CorpPass
is another initiative which demonstrates Singapore’s commitment to create
better efficiencies and a more secure digital ecosystem for businesses
to thrive in a Smart Nation.</p>
<p>The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) expects more than 250,000 active
businesses to use CorpPass, which will be the only login method for online
corporate transactions with the Government from Q3 2018.</p>
<p>The majority of businesses are now CorpPass-ready. Businesses that have
not registered for CorpPass should do so as existing login methods, such
as SingPass and EASY, will cease by then. CorpPass will also be made available
to foreign businesses in 2018.</p>

<p>“I had participated in the pilot use of the CorpPass system and given
feedback as a trial user. The basic setup is user-friendly, and I have
even managed to guide my OEM client through it with the help of a demo
on Facebook. It helped that resources were readily available in the form
of online materials and public briefings.”</p>

<p>~ Mr Kelvin Tan</p>
<p>One early adopter of CorpPass is Mr Kelvin Tan, who is working in a family-owned
SME dealing with bottled food products. Mr Tan said, “I had participated
in the pilot use of the CorpPass system and given feedback as a trial user.
The basic setup is user-friendly, and I have even managed to guide my OEM
client through it with the help of a demo on Facebook. It helped that resources
were readily available in the form of online materials and public briefings.”</p>
<p>Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Government Chief Information Officer, GovTech said,
“CorpPass is designed for all businesses, from multi-national companies
to SMEs, and allows for greater data security, better control and enhanced
convenience for business users when they transact with the Government.
We are glad that the majority of businesses have started using CorpPass
and strongly urge the rest to do so now.”</p>

<p>Industry partners, such as the <strong>Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF)</strong>,
have also been supportive in promoting CorpPass to their members. Mr Koh
Juan Kiat, Executive Director of SNEF, shared, “We saw the merits of having
a digital identity for business transactions. We have been working with
GovTech, and will continue to do so, to raise awareness and encourage our
members to sign up early, to enjoy the convenience and security of using
more than 130 Government digital services.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing suite of digital services managed by over
50 Government agencies, businesses can transact with Inland Revenue Authority
of Singapore (IRAS) using CorpPass by Q3 2018.</p>
