<p>The National Parks Board (NParks) and the Smart Nation and Digital Government
Group (comprising Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and Government
Technology Agency) are conducting a pilot trial of a four-legged robot
called SPOT to assist safe distancing efforts at parks, gardens and nature
reserves managed by NParks, including Park Connectors, Pulau Ubin, as well
as parks managed by town councils.</p>
<p><strong>Trial in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park</strong>
</p>
<p>From today (8 May), NParks and SNDGG will be deploying SPOT over a 3-km
stretch in the River Plains section of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park for two weeks
during off-peak hours. A recorded message will be broadcast from SPOT to
remind park visitors to observe safe distancing measures. SPOT will also
be fitted with cameras â€“ enabled with GovTech-developed video analytics
â€“ to estimate the number of visitors in parks. These cameras will not be
able to track and/or recognise specific individuals, and no personal data
will be collected.</p>
<p>SPOT will be controlled remotely, reducing the manpower required for park
patrols and minimising physical contact among staff, volunteer safe distancing
ambassadors and park visitors. This lowers the risk of exposure to the
virus. Unlike wheeled robots, SPOT works well across different terrains
and can navigate obstacles effectively, making it ideal for operation in
public parks and gardens.</p>
<p>SPOT is fitted with safety sensors to detect objects and people in its
path. It has in-built algorithms to detect an object or person within 1
metre of its proximity to avoid collision. SPOT will be accompanied by
at least one NParks officer during the trial period.</p>
<p>Should the trial prove successful, NParks will consider deploying SPOT
at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park during the morning and evening peak hours. NParks
will also study plans to deploy SPOT to other parks such as the Jurong
Lake Gardens.</p>
<p>SPOT is also currently being trialled at the Changi Exhibition Centre
community isolation facility to deliver essential items such as medicine
to patients. SNDGG will also explore the use of SPOT to support other COVID-19
related operations across agencies.</p>
<p>Technology has been used to help NParks in safe distancing work. The Safe
Distance @ Parks portal <a href="https://safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg</a>,
for instance, was developed by NParks to allow the public to look for a
park near them and check visitorship levels before leaving their house.
A total of 30 drones are also being deployed in selected parks and nature
areas to provide officers with a high vantage point to obtain visitorship
updates quickly, complementing ground observations, as well as give them
a better sense of the density of visitors in a specific area.</p>
<p>8 NParks and MOH reiterate the advice for the public to stay home to minimise
the risk of COVID-19 spread. If they wish to exercise (walk, jog and cycle),
they should go to a park or park connector that is in their neighbourhood
alone, and return to their home thereafter. They are required to wear masks
when outside their homes except when doing strenuous exercise, such as
brisk walking, jogging, cycling or walking in hilly terrain, for example
in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Bukit Batok Nature Park.</p>
