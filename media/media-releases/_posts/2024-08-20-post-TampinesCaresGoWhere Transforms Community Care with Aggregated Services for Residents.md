<p>Singapore, 17 August 2024</p>
<p>The North East Community Development Council (NE CDC) together with SingHealth,
launched Singapore’s first town-specific one-stop access platform for aggregated
healthcare, community and government services -TampinesCaresGoWhere - at
the Healthier Together @ Tampines event today. This marked a significant
milestone in transforming community care. The initiative is set to offer
close to 300,000 Tampines residents with a central access point to these
support services through an easy-to-use site, uniting health and community
resources to offer seamless and effective care.</p>
<p>The launch highlights the collaborative efforts between the Tampines Grassroots
Advisers, Grassroots Organisations, SingHealth and, key organisations such
as the Agency for Integrated Care, Healthier SG, Health Promotion Board,
and the Muslim Health Professionals Association.</p>
<p>"Over the years, Tampines has developed a robust support system for residents
of various life stages in the town. By providing a centralised platform,
we make it easier for everyone to find and use these services. This effort
also catalyses collaboration among partners to enhance community support
and ensure that everyone gets the care they need,” said Desmond Choo, Mayor
of North East District.</p>
<p>In partnership with Government Technology Agency (GovTech), TampinesCaresGoWhere
simplifies the process for families, especially those with members at different
life stages and varying needs, to find all the support they require in
one place. This eliminates the need to search across multiple sources and
provides easy access to services and programs, enabling residents to access
resources for a better quality of life and social engagement.</p>
<p>This initiative also helps foster collaborations among NE CDC’s partners
to provide effective care for all residents. SingHealth, as the Regional
Health Manager for Eastern Singapore, plays a pivotal role in forging and
coordinating community partnerships to ensure the well-being of the population.
By adopting a life course approach, SingHealth identifies and addresses
the diverse health needs of residents – ranging from preventive care to
therapeutic interventions and supportive services – and actively facilitates
collaboration across the health and care ecosystem. The seamless integration
of clinical services and community resources ensures that the care ecosystem
is easy to navigate and access, allowing residents to receive holistic,
coordinated, and continuous care.</p>
<p>Professor Lee Chien Earn, Deputy Group CEO (Regional Health System), SingHealth,
commented, “SingHealth is thrilled to collaborate with NE CDC, GovTech
and community partners in our shared goal to empower our residents to enhance
their health and well-being. Together, we can develop and grow the health
and care ecosystem in Tampines to meet not just the needs of our residents
but also their health aspirations.”</p>
<p>The launch event, Healthier Together @ Tampines drew close to 800 residents.
Residents participated in fall risk and functional health assessments,
enrolled in Healthier SG for personalized health advice, and explored a
vibrant marketplace with health-related products and services. The event
also featured booths from various organizations and agencies catering to
children, young working adults, families and persons with disabilities,
creating a comprehensive and engaging experience for all.</p>
