<h3>Easier and more secure logins with the new SingPass Mobile app.&nbsp;Users no longer need to enter passwords and carry physical tokens</h3>
<p>From today, all SingPass users can download the SingPass Mobile app from
Google Play or the App Store. With the new app, users can now log in using
their fingerprint, facial recognition (for selected smartphones) or a 6-digit
passcode. They no longer need to enter their passwords when performing
digital government transactions, such as checking CPF balances and applying
for HDB flats. Also, with SingPass Mobile, users based overseas will now
be able to use the app to transact digitally with the Singapore Government,
without the need for a physical token.</p>
<p>SingPass Mobile will be an additional option for SingPass users to log
in by 2-factor Authentication (2FA). The existing modes of SMS One-Time
Password (OTP) and OneKey token will continue to be available to SingPass
users.</p>
<p>Mr Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive, of GovTech, said, ‚ÄúEvery month, we
receive about 150,000 requests from SingPass users to reset their passwords.
The new SingPass Mobile app will offer a more convenient login option,
as users no longer need to enter their passwords to log in. SingPass Mobile
is another step towards our vision for citizens to access government and
private sector digital services securely with a single, trusted National
Digital Identity.‚Äù</p>
<p>To activate the SingPass Mobile app, SingPass users will need to complete
the following steps:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Download ‚ÄúSingPass Mobile‚Äù from the official app store (Google Play or
App Store). Check that the app developer is a ‚ÄúGovernment Technology Agency‚Äù.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch the app and complete a one-time set-up. Verify their identity using
an OTP sent via SMS, or generated by the OneKey token.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>SingPass Mobile also comes with enhanced security features to protect
the user‚Äôs&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data. For example, when the app detects any
potential security breach or the presence of malicious software on the
mobile device, the user will not be allowed to use the app on the device.</p>
<p>Users are reminded to only use their&nbsp;own&nbsp;fingerprint or facial
image to register on their smartphone, and not to share their 6-digit passcode
with other individuals.</p>
<p>The app will be progressively updated with new features to make it a one-stop
touch point for government digital services. Users can visit&nbsp;for more
