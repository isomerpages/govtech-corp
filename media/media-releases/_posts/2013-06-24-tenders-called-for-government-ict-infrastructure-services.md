> Tenders Called for Government ICT Infrastructure Services

The Singapore Government is calling a series of tenders for the provision of government infrastructure services in order to provide for a smooth transition before the end of the current Standard ICT Operating Environment (SOE) contract. 

Launched in 2008, the objective of SOE was to consolidate the Government’s infocomm services into a single environment. To date, 75,000 suites have been deployed to 96 government agencies. The SOE contract will expire in February 2016. As such, there is a need to put new contracts in place to ensure service continuity.

The Government will continue to operate in a single environment to enhance Whole-of-Government security, inter-operability and resiliency. However, having gathered feedback from the agencies and taking into consideration their needs in the years to come, the new tenders are structured to allow greater flexibility so that agencies have more options to manage their IT infrastructure for optimal efficiency.

The new tenders will amongst other things cover the development, upgrading of operations and maintenance of services such as Email & Collaboration, PCs and printers that are currently available in SOE.

#### **The first set of tenders will cover the following areas:**

**Central core infrastructure services**
This tender will seek providers to deliver, migrate and operate (with maintenance support) the IT infrastructure within the Data Centres in order to provide the base IT building blocks required for other internal end users facing IT services (such as email and collaboration services, remote access services) to leverage on.

**Messaging and collaboration services**
This tender is for messaging and collaboration services to the Government and statutory boards. Services such as email, instant messaging and conferencing services will be offered based on a monthly subscription model.

**Desktops, notebooks and printers**
The PC Bulk Tender aims to supply desktops, notebooks and printers to the Government and statutory boards.  

**Agency Facilities Management (AFM)**
This tender is for the supply of AFM support services to the Government and statutory boards. AFM support services will enable each agency to manage its end-user computing devices and IT infrastructure and simplify its day-to-day IT operations support.      

The remaining tenders will be issued in the months ahead.
