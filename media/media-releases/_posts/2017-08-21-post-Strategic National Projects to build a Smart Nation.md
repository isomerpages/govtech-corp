<p>The Smart Nation initiative is about harnessing the full power and potential
of digital and smart technologies to create new jobs and business opportunities,
in order to make our lives more convenient, and our economy more productive,
through more efficient Government and business processes. But beyond that,
a Smart Nation is about creating new opportunities in a digital age, and
transforming the way people live, work and play, so that Singapore remains
an outstanding global city.</p>
<h3>Why the push for a Smart Nation?</h3>
<p>At the fundamental level, Smart Nation is about making daily transactions
easy and seamless, be it making a payment, applying for a permit, etc.
The technology that enables this smooth process should be invisible, and
the design should be intuitive, so that the solution is not just convenient,
but a delight to use. At a broader level, Smart Nation is about achieving
efficiencies and effectiveness, be it leveraging sensors and data to better
manage traffic or monitor security threats. Cost savings brought about
by digitisation is also key to growing businesses. Citizens can use technology
to improve quality of life, be it through monitoring health, reducing time
spent on administrative tasks, or planning commutes, etc. But most importantly,
Smart Nation is about transforming Singapore’s economy, and ensuring that
there will be jobs and opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>As an open economy, Singapore is impacted by global forces – geopolitical
tensions, potential threat of anti-globalisation, and technology disruptions
across many industries. Internally, there are challenges such as an aging
population. But Singapore has strengths and achievements that place the
country in a good position to succeed in Smart Nation:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Being small, compact, and having a digitally literate population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good infrastructure, with high speed connectivity, and high smart phone
penetration;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieving successful computerisation and digital transformation in agencies
such as the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore (IRAS), and National Library Board (NLB);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pool of talent who perform well in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering
&amp; Mathematics) disciplines, and greater demand and higher wages for
infocomm-technology professionals and engineers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vibrant and global innovation ecosystem with an expanding number of
local and international start-ups; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An open data network with private sector leveraging on Government data
through data.gov.sg to drive new services, and public-private collaborations
such as GrabShuttle which leveraged on the Beeline platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the Smart Nation journey, the Government has also been actively
using digital technology to better serve the public. For example, the recently
announced Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) for various primary and
secondary schools is an initiative that empowers students towards self-directed
learning. And soon, motorists will be able to pay for parking charges at
public car parks via a mobile app, in place of paper coupons.</p>

<h3>Strategic National Projects</h3>
<p>However, there is a real danger that Singapore could fall behind in emerging
areas, such as e-payments and digital identity systems. Singapore needs
to do more, and with a renewed sense of urgency. The Government is therefore
taking a more integrated approach to lay the foundation infrastructure,
and drive pervasive adoption of digital and smart technologies throughout
the economy and society. In the immediate months, the Government will focus
on the following strategic national projects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>National Digital Identity framework, for citizens and businesses to transact
digitally in a convenient and secure manner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e-Payments drive, to allow everyone to make simple, swift, seamless, and
safe payments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart Nation Sensor Platform, to accelerate the deployment of sensors
and other IOT (Internet of Things) devices that will make our city more
liveable and secure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart Urban Mobility, to leverage data and digital technologies, including
artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles, to further enhance the
public transport commute;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moments of Life, which bundles relevant government services, across different
agencies, to the citizen at key moments of his life. This reduces the need
for citizens to transact with multiple government agencies, for a more
seamless and convenient experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve the above outcomes, the Government will actively engage citizens
and businesses, respond to their feedback and needs, and create space for
innovation and co-creation. The Government is also in the process of crystallising
the next phase of similarly impactful projects to advance Smart Nation,
and will seek views and perspectives from different sources.</p>
