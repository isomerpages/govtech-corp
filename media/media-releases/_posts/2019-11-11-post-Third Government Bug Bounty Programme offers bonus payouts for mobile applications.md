<p><em>Bug bounty hunters will receive US$500 special bonus for validated vulnerabilities in mobile apps</em>
</p>
<p>The Government Technology Agency (GovTech), supported by the Cyber Security
Agency of Singapore (CSA), will be conducting the third Government Bug
Bounty Programme (BBP) from 18 November to 8 December 2019.</p>
<p>The third Government BBP, which runs for three weeks, will be expanded
to cover 12 Internet-facing government ICT systems, digital services and
mobile applications with high user touchpoints: ACRA-on-the-GO Mobile and
Bizfile (ACRA); eFocus and iWitness (MHA); HealthHub (HPB); LTA Website
and MyTransport Mobile (LTA); MyEnv Mobile (NEA); MyTax Portal (IRAS);
OneService Mobile (MND); SingStat Website and SingStat Mobile App (MTI-DOS).</p>
<p>Similar to the first two Government BBPs, only ethical hackers who have
registered with the appointed bug bounty company, HackerOne, will be allowed
to participate in this programme. Rewards can range from US$250 to US$10,000
depending on the severity of the discovered vulnerability. A special bonus
of US$500 will be awarded for validated mobile vulnerabilities in the third
Government BBP due to the increased complexities involved in the process.</p>
<p>Discovered vulnerabilities will be reported to the relevant organisations
for remediation. GovTech will share the key findings by February 2020.</p>
<p>The BBP is part of the Governmentâ€™s ongoing efforts to work with the cybersecurity
community and industry to strengthen and safeguard government ICT systems
and digital services. It complements the conventional methods of vulnerability
assessment and penetration testing, enabling the Government to benchmark
its defences against the global and local community of researchers and
white hats. The first two Government BBPs covered 14 government systems
and involved some 700 cybersecurity researchers and white hats, with a
total bounty of close to US$38,000 paid out.</p>
<p>To supplement the BBP, which is time bound and limited to a fixed set
of systems and services, GovTech launched the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/report-vulnerability" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Vulnerability Disclosure Programme</a> on
1 October 2019 to encourage the publicâ€™s responsible reporting of any suspected
vulnerability found in government Internet-facing web-based and mobile
applications.</p>
<p>These collaborations with the cybersecurity community-at-large have helped
the Government discover vulnerabilities that would otherwise be undetected,
and strengthen the security posture of our ICT systems and digital services.</p>
