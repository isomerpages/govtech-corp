<h3>Building a Smart Nation - GovTech</h3>
<p>IDA, or the soon-to-be-formed Government Technology Agency (GovTech),
will continue to partner with the Infocomm technology (ICT) industry and
invest in technologies such as data analytics, ICT infrastructure and platform-as-a-service
to develop citizen-centric services.&nbsp;This&nbsp;aims to enhance the
quality of citizens‚Äô lives and make business transactions with the government
easier.</p>
<p>GovTech, which will&nbsp;be established&nbsp;at the end of this year,
will lead technological transformation in government.&nbsp;The agency will
be tasked with building a more intuitive and anticipatory Government through
digital service delivery with technologies,&nbsp;nurturing and attracting&nbsp;ICT
talent, and&nbsp;ensuring&nbsp;that people are always at the heart of digital
service transformation for the public sector. The agency will also&nbsp;make
use of&nbsp;trending methodologies and technologies, such as agile and
data analytics, to create innovative services.</p>
<h4>SMEs accounted for more than half of ICT contracted value in&nbsp;FY15</h4>
<p>The government will continue to partner with the industry to co-create
such digital solutions. It will&nbsp;be calling&nbsp;for a projected S$2.82
billion of ICT tenders across FY16.&nbsp;These ICT tenders will comprise
mainly infrastructure and ICT security bulk contracts due to some multi-year
contracts ending in FY16, as well as contracts&nbsp;relating to agency-specific
systems.&nbsp;In FY15, SMEs accounted for more than half of the total contracted
value of ICT tenders.</p>
<p>One key focus for government procurement this year will be to enhance
ICT infrastructure&nbsp;to better support&nbsp;the data and digital services
needs of a Digital Government in a Smart Nation. For example, increased
data centre virtualisation will allow the government to modernise the hosting
of ICT applications and ensure faster production time for new digital services.&nbsp;Wi-Fi
will be extended&nbsp;to more areas within Government schools to support&nbsp;smart&nbsp;learning.
The government will also continue to invest in its cybersecurity efforts,
with a bulk tender for IT security services to&nbsp;be called&nbsp;in this
fiscal year. Such projects that are larger in scope will&nbsp;be rolled
out&nbsp;over a few years.</p>
<p>Ms Jacqueline Poh, Managing Director, IDA, said, ‚ÄúWe want to empower Singapore
with possibilities through technology. To do that, investment in infrastructure
is necessary so that innovative citizen-centric services can be built and
enhanced on a strong foundation. There will be opportunities&nbsp;abound&nbsp;for
the government and industry to collaborate and build a Smart Nation together.‚Äù</p>
<p>To help more local technology companies take up ICT projects, the Accreditation@IDA
scheme, launched in 2014, provides an independent&nbsp;third party&nbsp;evaluation
of early-stage growth technology by promising Singapore-based companies.
To date, 13 companies, including Hope Technik (an unmanned aerial vehicle
and automated guided vehicle solution provider), Sense Infosys (data analytics)
and V-Key (mobile and web security) have been accredited.&nbsp;These accredited
companies have also won more than 25 government contracts to date.</p>
<p>Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Assistant Chief Executive (Government Chief Information
Office), IDA, said, ‚ÄúThe Government wants to co-create solutions with the
industry. We have therefore introduced greater agility in our ICT procurement
processes, such as the Public Sector ICT Supplier Panel and Outcome-based
Procurement, to ensure that agencies can work with the industry to utilise
new technological solutions more easily.‚Äù</p>
<p>Speakers from the Ministry of Health, MOH Holdings, the National Environment
Agency and the Workforce Development Agency also shared their ICT plans
at the IB.</p>
<p>These plans were announced at IDA‚Äôs annual Industry Briefing (IB), where
IDA provides updates on government strategies and business opportunities&nbsp;relating&nbsp;to
ICT.&nbsp;The event was attended by close&nbsp;to 1,000 attendees including
industry CXOs and government CIOs.</p>
