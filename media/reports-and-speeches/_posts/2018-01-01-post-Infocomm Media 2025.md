<p>In 2025, we envision a Singapore transformed for the better by infocomm
media. It will be a nation where people live meaningful and fulfilled lives
enabled by technology, and where there are exciting opportunities for all.
It will be a place where infocomm media enables a better quality of life
for our people through world-class connectivity, compelling local content,
and technologies to make everyday lives smoother and more convenient. It
will be a living lab for entrepreneurs, growth companies and multinationals
in the infocomm media space where they continually experiment and innovate
to contribute to sustainable and quality economic growth.</p>
<p>To realise these desired outcomes, Infocomm Media 2025 sets out to create
a globally competitive infocomm media ecosystem that enables and complements
Singapore‚Äôs Smart Nation vision. This ecosystem supports our people and
enterprises in tapping on infocomm media to effect economic and social
transformation, and to create enriching and compelling content to help
bind our communities and foster a common identity. Visit <a href="http://www.mci.gov.sg/web/corp/infocomm-media-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Infocomm Media 2025 microsite</a> to
