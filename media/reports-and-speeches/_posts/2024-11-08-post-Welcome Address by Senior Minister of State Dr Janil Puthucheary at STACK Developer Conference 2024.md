<h3>Celebrating 10 Years of Smart Nation</h3>
<p>Good morning everyone, and welcome to STACK 2024. We launched our Smart
Nation journey in 2014. Before that, we were engaged in technology-driven
transformation, digitalisation, and the development of products. But 10
years ago, we brought that together under this initiative we called the
Smart Nation, and we had some reasons for doing that. We had some aims
and some goals. We wanted to build better lives for our citizens by driving
digital transformation across three broad areas. The government needed
to transform, our society was transforming, and we wanted our economy to
transform.</p>
<p>We wanted to develop a digital government that made life better for our
citizens, using technology. We wanted a digital society for all, for our
people to be in a position to embrace the opportunities that technology
would provide. And we wanted this to result in a digital economy that had
thriving enterprises and created good job opportunities here in Singapore.</p>
<p>We have indeed borne fruit over the last 10 years. We do have a vibrant
digital society. We have a digital economy that is growing and thriving,
and creating opportunities. We have prepared Singaporeans to take advantage
of these economic opportunities, and we have increased the number of tech
professionals in Singapore â€“ growing by about 25 per cent from 2018 to
2023. We had our eye on inclusivity, making sure that those who are less
digitally savvy are able to adopt these new technologies and take advantage
of these opportunities. Our colleagues in the SG Digital Office have trained
more than 340,000 seniors to pick up digital skills for use in everyday
life, using technology for their day-to-day needs.</p>
