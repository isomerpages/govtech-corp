<h3>Beware of scam letters bearing GovTech’s logo and forged signatures</h3>
<p>The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) has received reports of scam
letters sent to suppliers via fax. These scam letters, seeking advertising
support for a publication, used GovTech’s logo without authorisation and
borne the forged signatures of the Smart Nation and Digital Government
Group’s Permanent Secretary, Mr Ng Chee Khern, and GovTech’s Chief Executive,
Mr Kok Ping Soon. These letters were not sent out by GovTech. Please see
the pictures of the scam letter below.</p>
