<p>The eGovernment Masterplans set the tone and direction of digital governance
technologies over a set period of time. There have been five eGov Masterplans
so far: Civil Service Computerisation Programme, eGAP I (2000 ‚Äì 2003),
eGAP II (2003 ‚Äì 2005), iGov 2010 and eGov 2015.</p>

<p>The focus of eGov 2015 shifted the delivery of Government e-services from
a top-down ‚ÄúGovernment-to-You‚Äù system to a ‚ÄúGovernment-with-You‚Äù approach.
This approach encouraged greater co-creation and interaction between the
Government, citizens and private sector to create better solutions for
the country and its people.</p>
<p>Full scope of eGov 15‚Äôs Strategic Thrusts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Co-creating for greater value (Government as a service provider/Government
as a platform provider)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connecting for active participation (Consulting the public/Inviting Ideas
from the public)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catalysing Whole-of-Government transformation (Transforming public sector
infrastructure and services through G-Cloud and SGEA/Transforming public
sector workplace and capabilities)</p>
</li>

<p>iGov 2010‚Äôs primary goal was to achieve a more integrated government through
the use of infocomm technology. In order to achieve this, backend processes
were integrated across agencies, allowing them to provide a more customer-friendly
service delivery. Efforts were made to develop insights into the needs
and preferences of the customers, and to anticipate their needs in order
to increase the richness of e-Services. The reach of e-services was also
extended, with steps taken to provide citizens lacking in access to the
Internet with the facilities to do so.</p>
<p>Full scope of iGov 10‚Äôs Strategic Thrusts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing reach and richness of e-Services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing citizens‚Äô mindshare in e-engagement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing capacity and synergy in government</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing national competitive advantage</p>

</ul>

<h3>Civil Service Computerisation Programme (1980 ‚Äì 1999)</h3>
<p>The Civil Service Computerisation Programme (CSCP) was started with a
focus to improve public administration through the effective use of ICT.
The early days of the programme were primarily simple processes that would
improve efficiency, such automating work functions and reducing paperwork.
Over time, data was converted to digital formats, by the turn of the early
90s, emphasis shifted towards the consolidation of computing resources
into the form of a shared data centre and a civil service-wide network.</p>
