<p>Speech By Dr Yaacob IBRAHIM, Minister for Communications and Information,
at the Infocomm Media Business Exchange Opening Ceremony on Tuesday, 18
June 2013, 9.35am, Level 4, Simpor Room</p>
<p>Honourable Ministers, Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am very happy to join you this morning as we open the annual Infocomm
Media Business Exchange or imbX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a very lively discussion yesterday at the Ministerial Forum on ICT,
where we focused on the role that infocomm plays in promoting socio-economic
development and innovation. Today, I would like to share how Singapore
intends to continue leveraging technological advancements to benefit our
people and businesses, and in turn, transform Singapore for the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Singapore: An Intelligent Nation and Global City, Powered by Infocomm</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Singapore has made good progress in implementing the Intelligent Nation
2015 masterplan or iN2015. Designed to transform Singapore into a global
city powered by infocomm, the masterplan has propelled Singapore to be
a leader in the infocomm sector. We are ranked 1st in Waseda University's
Global e-Government Ranking Reports since 2009. <sup>[1]</sup> From 2010,
we are also placed 2nd in the World Economic Forum's Global Information
Technology Report. <sup>[2]</sup>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore's infocomm industry continues to be a key contributor to our
economy, registering strong and healthy year-on-year growth of 23 per cent
in 2012 to reach $102 billion of ICT revenue. <sup>[3]</sup> Singapore's
infocomm sector is also a strong contributor to national employment, providing
jobs for more than 144,000 infocomm professionals <sup>[4]</sup>. Singapore
will continue to improve our infocomm infrastructure to increase our business
competitiveness and enhance our people's quality of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paving the way for ultra-high speed connectivity, 95 per cent of homes
and businesses in Singapore are now wired up to the Next Generation Nationwide
Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN). To date, more than 330,000 subscribers
are served by 20 retail service providers. <sup>[5]</sup>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new phase of the Wireless@SG programme will see access speeds for
Singapore's free public Wi-Fi increase to up to 2 Mbps. Inter-operator
roaming will begin by the end of this month, enabling users to access the
Internet network island-wide. Also, from 1 April next year, SIM-based authentication
will also be implemented to simplify the wireless login process. These
continuing efforts will improve the Internet experience for Singaporeans
in their work and leisure activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singaporeans have a one-stop access to over 400 government e-services
via the eCitizen portal, and some 100 mobile government services via the
mGov@SG mobile app. Singaporeans are also able to have quick access to
letters from government ministries and agencies via their secure digital
mailbox, OneInBox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater connectivity and improved infocomm infrastructure also allows
Singaporeans to enjoy the comforts of working closer to home. The Infocomm
Development Authority or IDA has recently launched a call for proposal
for "Smart Work Centres". Five community spaces have been put up for interested
operators to consider creating professional workspaces for different work
needs, in the convenience of our heartland estates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government will continue with our work to enhance access to mobile
services for all our citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Singapore continues to improve our infocomm infrastructure, we also
collaborate with our neighbours to enhance connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This morning, I am especially pleased to announce that Singapore, Brunei,
Indonesia and Malaysia have jointly agreed to harmonise the use of the
700 MHz digital dividend radio frequencies. The agreement ‚Äì which is in
line with the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity band plan, will allow the countries
to meet growing demand for mobile broadband, improve regional mobile roaming,
and provide more competitive mobile broadband services. Our population
can look forward to greater access to rich media content on their mobile
devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 700 MHz digital dividend radio frequencies, expected to be available
by 2020 - after the switchover from analogue to digital broadcasting, will
greatly benefit us and strengthen our connectivity with the region and
beyond.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using Infocomm to Enhance Productivity and Address Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ICT's role in contemporary society goes beyond linking people and businesses
around the world. Today, ICT is seen as a key enabler in addressing the
many challenges that businesses face today. Companies across industries
are increasingly adopting infocomm as a means to enhance their productivity,
reduce their reliance on manpower, and overcome the challenges of resource
limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance in healthcare, some of our doctors can soon monitor patients‚Äô
health conditions without requiring them to travel to clinics for routine
checks. This is enabled through the Telehealth Call-For-Collaboration by
the Ministry of Health and IDA, which has awarded a grant to myHealth Sentinel
Pte Ltd to provide remote monitoring of chronic disease patients using
wireless devices. Such efforts pave the way for timely intervention and
treatment, improving the way healthcare services are delivered in Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data analytics also play a key role to enhance business competitiveness
and productivity, enabling businesses to improve efficiencies in business
operations by deriving richer insights from the wealth of data collected.
Businesses across industries - from retail, wholesale, healthcare to manufacturing,
will be able to make informed decisions that are data-driven, and obtain
greater productivity and profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help businesses discover insights about their customers and operations,
a suite of Business Analytics shared services will have its features progressively
made available to retail enterprises from the middle of this year. Deployed
on shared infrastructure, the entry barrier for these businesses is lowered
by reducing adoption costs and shortening the overall implementation time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we make efforts to facilitate the penetration of business analytics
across industries, Singapore must strengthen our position as an international
data and analytics hub. To achieve this, we need skilled manpower with
Big Data and analytics capabilities. I am happy that the establishment
of EMC Computer Systems‚Äô Big Data Centre will help address the manpower
gaps in the market. IDA has also jointly set up a Business Analytics Centre
of Excellence with Revolution Analytics to hire data developers and scientists
to build up Singapore‚Äôs capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IDA is also collaborating with the infocomm industry to train more professionals
to adapt to the ever-changing infocomm landscape. A Memorandum of Intent
between IDA and Palo Alto Networks will establish the PAN Innovation Centre
and expand the pool of local information security professionals. Such efforts
will place Singapore in good stead to become a data analytics hub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IDA will also launch the Data Innovation Challenge on 26 June, with three
global companies across the healthcare, manufacturing as well as advertising
and media sectors, on-board for a start. The first of its kind in Asia,
the challenge will bring together data scientists, ICT companies, academia
and research institutes interested to crowd-source for ideas and business
solutions, to improve their processes and promote co-innovation on a global
scale.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Harnessing Convergence: A New Infocomm Media Masterplan</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whilst Singapore has grown its infocomm industry over the years, we must
continue leveraging on technological evolutions to create new strengths,
and equip ourselves for the next phase of infocomm development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To do that, we will need to seize the opportunities arising from the growing
convergence of the infocomm and media sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This convergence has changed the way we live, work and play. Young children
in school are benefiting from interactive textbooks that integrate videos
and animation with text to stimulate thinking. The revolution brought about
by YouTube and iTunes now means people expect instant, on-the-go access
to entertainment and information, as we enjoy books, videos, music, and
television programmes on our mobile devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This convergence will continue to create opportunities for all - through
greater convenience and benefits for society, and new opportunities for
business growth. To take advantage of this potential, we must look at the
development of media and infocomm in a holistic and integrated manner.
I had thus announced in March this year that I will commission a combined
masterplan for the infocomm and media sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, I am pleased to announce the formation of the Infocomm Media Masterplan
Steering Committee that will lead the development of the new Infocomm Media
Masterplan. The 14-member committee, will be chaired by Mr Koh Boon Hwee,
Chairman of Credence Partners. It will be led by the private sector, and
supported by my Ministry, along with IDA, the Media Development Authority
and the Economic Development Board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the next two years, the Steering Committee will work closely with
academia, and the private and public sectors to deliver a Masterplan that
will guide the development of Singapore‚Äôs infocomm and media sectors into
2025.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The convergence of infocomm and media gives us added reason to meet at
a forum like imbX. It is Asia‚Äôs largest ICT and media showcase of the latest
infocomm and media technologies and solutions. imbX also provides us with
compelling opportunities to engage in important discussions on ICT, media
and convergence, and its impact on our future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we begin this year‚Äôs imbX, it is my hope that you will have a memorable
stay in Singapore. I also wish you a most fruitful and rewarding experience
here at the exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to declare imbX 2013, open. Thank you.</p>
</li>
