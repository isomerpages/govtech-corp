</p>
<p>The Digital Government Exchange (DGX) is an annual global gathering of
Government Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and public sector leaders
from digital governments and smart cities. Organised by the Smart Nation
and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) since 2016, DGX is a unique international
platform that has developed a community of like-minded leaders who can
engage in information exchange, sharing of experiences, and mutual learning,
while exploring future collaboration opportunities.</p>
<p>DGX also features technical Working Groups (WGs) where countries and cities
deep dive into specific subject matters pertinent to governmentsâ€™ drive
for digitalisation.</p>
<p>DGX WGs have produced in-depth reports studying various digital government
topics across the years.</p>
