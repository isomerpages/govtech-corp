<p>Honourable Ministers</p>
<p>ASEAN Secretary General, Le Luong Minh</p>
<p>ITU Secretary-General Dr Hamadoun Tour√©</p>
<p>Excellencies</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>Good Evening.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 13th ASEAN Telecommunications
and IT Ministers Meeting (‚Äú13thTELMIN‚Äù) Gala Dinner and the ASEAN ICT Awards
2013. Tonight, we celebrate the spirit of friendship and partnerships within
ASEAN, and between ASEAN and our Dialogue Partners. We are also here to
recognise ICT innovations in ASEAN.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>ASEAN - Reinforcing Ties</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Today, ASEAN Member States have had many fruitful discussions to strengthen
our ICT collaboration and chart the regional ICT journey for greater growth
and to enhance quality of life for our people. Tomorrow, we will have similar
conversations with our Dialogue Partners, which I am confident will be
equally fruitful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Dialogue Partners ‚Äì China, India, Republic of Korea, Japan and the
International Telecommunication Union (‚ÄúITU‚Äù) contribute in many ways;
through sharing of experiences, providing expertise, assisting to develop
our human capital, just to name a few. ASEAN is grateful to our Dialogue
Partners for your commitment, contributions and friendship in being part
of ASEAN‚Äôs ICT journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Embracing Innovation in ASEAN</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While the governments in ASEAN have close relations with each other and
with our Dialogue Partners, ASEAN‚Äôs ICT development cannot take off without
the support from our industry players. Indeed, with the use of ICT almost
ubiquitous, innovations from the industry have a tremendous impact on our
lives more than ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, today we are seeing companies with access to almost unlimited
computing power delivered via the cloud. Through advanced data mining technology,
analysts can uncover complex trends. Businesses are able to harness the
possibilities offered by the Internet and reap the benefits of e-commerce
and telecommuting. ICT has provided many opportunities, and societies that
have the most innovative ideas are able to realise them effectively and
quickly, would have a competitive advantage. The venue for tonight‚Äôs Dinner
also testifies how technology has been harnessed effectively to redefine
our living environment. The Gardens by the Bay uses cutting edge technology
to ensure that its energy needs are not provided at the expense of environmental
conservation. It is a testament that a garden within a city with limited
space is entirely possible, through the clever use of technology and innovation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>ASEAN ICT Awards Encourage Innovation and Excellence</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tonight, we recognise and celebrate innovations, through the ASEAN ICT
Awards (AICTA), which was first mooted by Brunei Darussalam. The awards
aim to encourage innovation and creativity in the region, and provide the
necessary platform to promote ASEAN ICT products and services globally.
Singapore is honoured to host the second AICTA awards this year, which
is also a key part of the ASEAN ICT Masterplan 2015 (‚ÄúAIM 2015‚Äù).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AICTA awards recognise innovations in six major categories: the Public
Sector category, the Private Sector category, the Start Up category, the
Corporate Social Responsibility category and the Digital Content category.
This year, we also introduced the Research and Development category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AICTA R&amp;D category is open to any research and development efforts
that discover, or invent, new knowledge, processes, products or services
that meet the demands of the market. Let me share this year‚Äôs nominees
for this category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Indonesia, the Klungbot or otherwise known as the ‚ÄúAngklung Robot‚Äù,
is a musical system from the Engineering Physics Department, ITB (Institut
Teknologi Bandung ‚Äì Bandung Institute of Technology), Indonesia, that fuses
the traditional and the modern. It seeks to enhance traditional musical
instrument with modern acoustic, robotic, and informatics technologies.
The Klungbot also enables the angklung composer writing an arrangement,
to try the composition without requiring actual musicians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Lao PDR, an Optical Character Recognition (‚ÄúOCR‚Äù) device by the E-Government
Center converts any image format to a text.file to be edited for other
purposes. The process is easily extendable to be used for other languages,
besides the Lao Language. This automated conversion process is fast, economical,
and does not use much labour, enable printed content to be shared over
the web or any other electronic medium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, from Singapore, the Multi-screen Cloud Social TV by Movue Media
Pte Ltd is a cloud-based, smart TV solution which integrates both back-end
media cloud technologies with front-end advanced human computer interaction
(‚ÄúHCI‚Äù) technologies. The cloud-based backend system offers a solution
that is independent of the viewing platform, to deliver a seamless viewing
experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These three companies demonstrate the importance of ICT in delivering
benefits to their customers and it is this spirit that we must continue
to cultivate in our ICT industries, to enhance the delivery of services
and to improve the quality of life of our people.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The AICTA honours the best of ASEAN‚Äôs ICT talent. I am pleased to note
that there are 18 ASEAN companies finalists, across the six categories.
Let me offer my congratulations once again to all the finalists. Your innovation
will go a long way to enhance the possibilities of technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish everyone a pleasant evening. Thank you.</p>
