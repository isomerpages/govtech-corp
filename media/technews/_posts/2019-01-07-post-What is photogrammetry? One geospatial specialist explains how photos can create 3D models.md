<h3>TL:DR: 3D models are very useful for understanding physical space. Using digital photogrammetry, photographs can be stitched together to create an accurate digital replica of a real-world structure or location. Mr Quek Junjie, associate geospatial specialist at GovTechâ€™s Geospatial Specialist Office, shares his insights on the technology.</h3>
<p>If a picture paints a thousand words, then a three-dimensional (3D) model
of an object or space is bound to tell an even more compelling story. Using
software to stitch together photographs of a location taken from different
angles, Mr Quek Junjie, associate geospatial specialist at the Government
Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), can construct virtual 3D models
of actual placesâ€”a technique known as digital photogrammetry.</p>

<p>In this interview with TechNews, he shared how government agencies can
tap on photogrammetry to manage and plan urban spaces.</p>
<h3>What is digital photogrammetry and how is it useful?</h3>
<p>Put simply, digital photogrammetry is a workflow to convert photographs
or videos of a physical space into a virtual 3D model that can be measured
and manipulated. Your input data is photographs, and depending on the equipment
used to obtain those photographs, your virtual 3D model will vary in terms
of detail and accuracy.</p>
<p>For example, if you use a smartphone camera to take comparatively lower-resolution
photos, then your resultant virtual 3D model will be less accurate, but
it can be built in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you use a DSLR camera, the level of detail and information
per photograph is greater, so the model will be more accurate, although
it could take longer to generate. This is just the â€˜photoâ€™ part of the
term â€˜photogrammetryâ€™. The other part of the word has to do with measurements.</p>
<p>Once you have a virtual 3D model that preserves information about the
scale and proportions of an area, you can perform calculations of not just
length or distance, but also area and volume. For instance, after you have
excavated a landfill, a lot of soil needs to be moved off-site. In the
past, you would get a quote from a tipper truck vendor who would estimate
the number of trucks required for that operation.</p>
<p>With digital photogrammetry, you could use a drone to map out the landfill
and land pile in detail, then use the virtual 3D model to calculate the
volume of soil that needs to be moved. This will help you derive a precise
number of tipper trucks to hire. In this case, since there is no guesswork
involved, digital photogrammetry can result in the more effective deployment
of resources, and potential cost savings.</p>
<h3>You mentioned that photos from smartphones can be used in digital photogrammetry. Can citizens help map certain areas in Singapore?</h3>
<p>I think it will be quite challenging to achieve a crowdsourcing-type model
for digital photogrammetry work. This is because you need some domain expertise
to carry out the entire process properly. For example, you need to take
the photos in a structural, ordered wayâ€”what is known as the structure
from motion (SfM) method. Sometimes, drones may be used, which means that
you need a license to operate the drone, and the flight path must be planned
in a specific way.</p>
<p>Also, because citizens use different kinds of smartphones, cameras and
settings, the software we use may have difficulty stitching the images
together into a virtual 3D model. So I think crowdsourcing digital photogrammetry
work is not very feasible at the moment.</p>
<h3>Could you tell us about a project within the government that involves digital photogrammetry?</h3>
<p>We recently collaborated with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) where
we carried out two POCs, including a three-day workshop during which we
walked LTA officers through the entire process of using digital photogrammetry,
from selecting the right camera to eventually building the virtual 3D model.</p>
<p>What LTA wanted to do was to explore mapping their construction sites
both above ground and underground i.e. train tunnels using digital photogrammetry.
Currently, for tunnel scanning, LTA is trialling a laser-based method that
is accurate to millimetres, but the technique is more time-consuming.</p>
<p>At the end of the POCs with LTA, we were able to generate a virtual 3D
model of the tunnel using digital photogrammetry, albeit at a lower resolution
than the laser-based technique.</p>
<p>One point to note is that additional lighting provision was required in
the tunnel environment to ensure good quality photos could be captured
for the digital photogrammetry process.</p>

<p>Based on this experience, LTA continued to explore using digital photogrammetry
as a functional tool for quick visualization. For example, it can be used
to create a quick virtual 3D model of structures above ground.</p>
<h3>What are some of the challenges you face in your role as a geospatial specialist?</h3>
<p>As a geospatial specialist, one of my key roles is to be an advocate for
useful technology dealing with locational data and 3D spaces, such as digital
photogrammetry. For the last one to two years, my team has been studying
the full spectrum of devices and processes associated with digital photogrammetry,
so we can now advise other agencies on what they can do with the technology
and the best practices surrounding it.</p>
<p>I would say that the challenges I encounter stem from the limitations
of the technology itself. Digital photogrammetry does not work very well
for indoor spaces with featureless walls and glass panels. To stitch together
multiple images and create the virtual 3D model, there needs to be a way
for the software to orientate each image with reference to another photo,
so if itâ€™s just a large featureless or transparent space, the lack of a
clear reference point can prevent the construction of a good virtual 3D
model.</p>
<h3>Going forward, what are some of your teamâ€™s goals?</h3>
<p>We will continue to help other government agencies understand the utility
of digital photogrammetry and identify relevant use cases for the technology.
For every geospatial mapping project, there is a need to strike a balance
between cost and delivery time, so digital photogrammetry could be a viable
option in certain contexts.</p>
<p>Moreover, we should keep in mind that digital photogrammetry need not
be used in isolation. It could complement other techniques, such as laser
mapping. Although laser mapping can produce a high-resolution virtual 3D
model, lasers donâ€™t reproduce colours, but if you add in the pixels from
the images captured for digital photogrammetry, you will then be able to
recreate a true-to-life model of 3D space.</p>
<p>I want to emphasise that digital photogrammetry is not an endpointâ€”it
provides you with a 3D environment to make measurements, overlay information
and plan for future work on a physical space.</p>
