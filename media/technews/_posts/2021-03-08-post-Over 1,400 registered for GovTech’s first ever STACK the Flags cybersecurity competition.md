</p>
<p>Over 1,400 participants (437 teams) registered, making Stack the Flags
2020 one of the largest CTF competitions in Singapore to date.</p>
<p>Held over a 48-hour period in early December, teams of up to four raced
to tackle challenges based on real-world scenarios in 11 cybersecurity
domains, such as cryptography, cloud, and the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>The virtually held event was organised by GovTech‚Äôs Cyber Security Group
(CSG) to engage the cybersecurity community as well as to spark interest
in participants who are just beginning to explore the field.</p>
<h3>How do CTF competitions work?</h3>
<p>In the traditional outdoor game of CTF, each team has a flag planted in
its base. To win, you must capture your opponent‚Äôs flag and bring it back
to your own base ‚Äì a concept that has been adapted widely to different
contexts such as first-person shooter video games.</p>
<p>In the realm of cybersecurity, the flag is a digital one that can be as
simple as a sequence of characters hidden in a database. Competitors will
have to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the system to get to the
flag.</p>
<p>STACK the Flags 2020 was a Jeopardy-style CTF, so named because of its
similar format to the long-running TV game show. Challenges are categorised
based its relevance to various cybersecurity domain and there is a varying
level of difficulty among the challenges. This is to create a rich CTF
experience and offer a different flavour for participants of different
skills and experiences. (For more on CTF cybersecurity competitions, read
this introductory piece by one of our GovTech colleagues.)</p>
<h3>All walks of life</h3>
<p>Indeed, Stack the Flags 2020 drew both international and local participants
ranging from cybersecurity professionals to students still learning about
the field.</p>
<p>Teams were divided into three categories: Category 1: Open Category 2:
Universities and Polytechnics; and Category 3: Junior Colleges, Integrated
Programmes and Institutes of Technical Education</p>
<p>One team ‚Äì a family of four ‚Äì even comprised two primary school pupils
aged 12 and 10! Although the team found many of the puzzles challenging,
they managed to crack one just a few hours into the competition, catapulting
them to sixth place at one point. ‚ÄúOn the whole, our family had a really
enjoyable time,‚Äù said Rachel, the mother in the team. She added that more
than a month on, her children were still ‚Äúlaughing and reminiscing about
the experience‚Äù.</p>
<h3>Competition Highlights</h3>
<p>A Close Call It was a close race that got only tighter towards the end.
From the get-go, the top 10 teams in each category were constantly swapping
ranks and in the final 12 hours, the top three were jockeying for pole
position till the very last moment.</p>

</p>
<p>It was also heartening to see that the fierce rivalry was within the confines
of the competition. Participants across teams grew closer as time went
by, chatting about their hobbies and other casual topics in the event‚Äôs
Discord channel.</p>
<h3>Most Popular Challenge Domain</h3>
<p>Open Source Intelligence was voted the ‚ÄúMost Liked‚Äù challenge domain,
with 37.64% of the corresponding teams (across all three participation
categories) voting for it. Challenges in this category required participants
to piece together publicly available information, such as unearthing the
social media accounts and other digital trails of the target to gather
his/her whereabouts.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a deep dive at the breakdown of the ‚ÄúMost Liked‚Äù challenge
domains across the 3 participation categories.</p>

<h3>Emerging talent</h3>
<p>While the open category was won by a group made up of mostly cyber security
professionals, they were closely followed by the runner-ups ‚Äì three students
and one full-time national serviceman. Named Chicken RCE, the group was
initially placed in Category 2 (Universities and Polytechnics) but requested
to be in the open category as they wanted to challenge themselves and pit
their skills against non-students.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe were definitely humbled by the amazing efforts put up by other teams.
There were many challenges we struggled with but saw other teams breeze
through them early into the competition,‚Äù said the team. ‚ÄúIn our efforts
to strategise for this CTF, we experimented with various team collaboration
strategies and workflows, and we believe we‚Äôve left this CTF better equipped
to collaborate on larger challenges in future.‚Äù</p>
<p>The cybersecurity expertise of Singaporean students was also showcased
as participants in category 2 and 3 performed as well as those in category
1. This is testament to Singapore‚Äôs investment to develop cybersecurity
talent and a spur to continue nurturing future generations for an evolving
cyber security landscape.</p>
<p>Category 3 winner Mitsuha, a team comprising students from the Infocomm
and Robotics Society in Hwa Chong Institution, said the competition exposed
them to various aspects of cyber security they had not encountered before.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlthough we did not know how to approach certain challenges, we utilised
alternative methods to try and solve the challenges. In addition, we also
learnt the need to learn the concept being tested on the spot so as to
understand how to approach the challenge,‚Äù the team said.</p>
<h3>See you at the next edition</h3>
<p>CSG had a great time hosting the competition. Even though members of the
Organising Committee had to rotate through 12-hour shifts over the weekend,
they had fun answering enquiries from participants and kept their spirits
up through a constant supply of snacks and meals provided by the CSG leaders.</p>
<p>With the success of the very first STACK the Flags, GovTech plans to host
the next iteration sometime in 2022. It‚Äôs never too early to start training
for the next STACK the Flags!</p>
<p>Till then, #hackyeah</p>
