Keeping our buildings safe is no easy feat

Officers from the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) have to conduct regular visual inspections of state properties to identify structural problems so that follow-up maintenance can be performed. This is a highly manual task that could turn dangerous when officers have to assess hard-to-reach areas.

But rather than have personnel climbing onto the rooftops of buildings to check for cracks, why not use aerial drones that are smart enough to seek out these defects? SLA and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) are collaborating to do just that. 

TechNews spoke to Mr Vincent Aw, head of land management at SLA, and Mr Roy New, geospatial specialist at GovTech, to find out more.
