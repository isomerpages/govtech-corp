<p>Zui Young was born with high astigmatism in his right eye and is only
able to see with the right eye. But he never once lost sight of his passion
for all things digital.</p>
<p>This GovTechie’s interest in computers started during his primary school
days when he was introduced to coding with the HTML language and Microsoft
FrontPage. That led him to learn programming in secondary school, then
to a Diploma in Business Information Technology at Singapore Polytechnic,
and a Bachelor and Master in Information Systems at Singapore Management
University.</p>
<p>An internship with the then – Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) landed
him a full-time job after graduation. Zui Young credits his parents – who
supported his interest in coding by buying him computers, software and
computer magazines – for his achievements.</p>

<p>Today, Zui Young works at GovTech as a Senior DevOps Engineer and takes
great pride in his work. For him, the job is a way to use technology to
positively impact the lives of fellow citizens. Zui Young builds digital
government services that improve our lifestyles.</p>
<p>Some of the work Zui Young is proudest of are the projects he and his
team worked on during these two years living with Covid-19. They dabbled
with the idea of Bluetooth contact tracing, which became the TraceTogether
app, and worked on the rapid design, implementation and support of SafeEntry
for contact tracing. His team also created SupplyAlly, which helped to
accelerate the distribution of essential goods such as masks and TraceTogether
tokens nationwide.</p>
<p>“I feel it’s important for managers (or) leaders to provide opportunities
for staff to be bold and be empowered to take on new challenges and be
innovative, especially in the ongoing technological revolution. It makes
a career that much more meaningful too,” he said.</p>
<p>Zui Young is a recent recipient of the Goh Chok Tong Enable Awards (UBS
Promise) and said he is glad to be seen as a role model for persons with
disabilities. Going forward, he wants to help the community by using his
abilities in software engineering to ensure that Singapore’s digital services
are user-friendly for people of all walks of life and that those with disabilities
are not left out of the rapid digitalisation effort.</p>
