<p>From social insurance transactions to municipal services, experts from
China and Sweden discussed practical use cases for AI on the first day
of GovTech‚Äôs Digital Government Exchange 2019.</p>
<p>A city is like a living, breathing creature‚Äîsteel and concrete buildings
make up its bones, transportation networks comprise its circulatory system,
and people are its muscles, making things happen. While the ‚Äòbodies‚Äô of
cities may be well-formed, their brains are arguably just maturing as governments
around the world start deploying artificial intelligence (AI) in meaningful
ways to create value for citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>At the fourth Digital Government Exchange, organised by the Government
Technology Agency of Singapore from 24-25 June 2019, experts gathered to
discuss practical use cases for AI. Mr Leong Der Yao, director of the data
science and AI division at GovTech, moderated the session, which included
Mr Lu Yong, vice president of Shanghai Data Exchange, and Dr Magnus Enzell,
deputy director of the Ministry of Finance, Sweden, as panellists.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAI is just a tool in our toolbox. What we need to decide is: Where is
AI best applied?‚Äù Dr Enzell remarked.</p>

<h3>Fit-for-purpose AI</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular sentiment, AI is not a homogenous technology nor a
magic bullet for all problems. Rather, Dr Enzell noted that AI is an umbrella
term encompassing innovations in the fields of natural language processing,
machine translation, image and graph analytics, visualisation, and much
more. Hence, matching the appropriate technological capability with the
right use case is critical.</p>
<p>In China, Mr Lu noted how AI and sensors had great potential to transform
municipal services, such as waste disposal. Unlike in the past, where the
removal of rubbish in trash bins was carried out at fixed intervals, sensors
can now send an alert to the relevant agency when a trash bin is nearing
maximum capacity. At the same time, AI is applied to analyse data on disposal
patterns for predictive waste clearance. ‚ÄúBy doing this, we can better
manage the hygiene level of an area,‚Äù said Mr Lu, adding that a similar
approach can be taken with predictive maintenance of elevators.</p>
<h3>Deciding with data</h3>
<p>Both panellists agreed that the foundation for developing practical AI
applications lies in the ability to collect and integrate data. Dr Enzell
highlighted the need for standards for data classification and rules or
guidelines surrounding data security.</p>
<p>Visualisation of data, once it has been analysed by AI, is just as important,
said Mr Lu. He showed how the command centre of the Jing‚Äôan district in
Shanghai, China, has an integrated interface that displays event assessment
and analysis reports as well as real-time information about the goings-on
in the city. Importantly, this information can be overlaid onto an accurate
geospatial map, giving authorities a bird‚Äôs-eye view of city management
while allowing them to zoom in on specific details as and when it is necessary.</p>
<p>Given the promise of AI-assisted decision making, some delegates in the
audience wondered if there was a better way to measure the impact that
AI systems are having when applied to digital governance. Dr Enzell mentioned
that measuring the impact of each individual AI use case is a helpful first
step. for example, one might register a reduction in the time taken to
complete a transaction online after the implementation of an AI solution.</p>
<p>Clearly, finding practical use cases for AI is just the beginning, and
more in-depth research and discussion are needed to fully understand how
to realise the full potential of AI while avoiding its perils.</p>
