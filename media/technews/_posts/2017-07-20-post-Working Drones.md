<p>They take to the sky on whirring blades, the hum of their propellers becoming
a popular soundtrack of the urban environment.</p>
<p>Drones — the latest generation of remote-controlled aerial tech — are
becoming increasingly popular not just among recreational enthusiasts,
but also among professional innovators.</p>
<p>Depending on the equipment they carry, drones can take on numerous exciting
functions.</p>
<p>Just as the dragons in Game of Thrones changed the landscape of war in
Westeros, the ‘Game of Drones’ looks set to revolutionise work and play.</p>
<p>(Editor: Please forgive the pun that is colder than the Winds of Winter.)</p>
<p>Here are five of the coolest real-life uses for drones we've found.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Eye in the sky</strong></h3>
<p>Humankind has always coveted a bird's eye view of the world.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise, then, that one of the most popular uses for drones is
capturing images from above.</p>
<p>Mr Joel Chia, a photographer also known online as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/idroneman/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Idroneman</a>, uses drones
to take breathtaking aerial pictures of landscapes in Singapore and abroad.</p>
<p>His work received a shoutout from none other than Singapore’s Prime Minister
Mr Lee Hsien Loong, who shared it in a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/pm-lee-lauds-singapore-photographer-for-his-stunning-drone-aerial-images" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2016 Facebook post</a>.</p>
<p>"Photography has taught me to take a step back, or with drones, to fly
up high and consider the bigger picture,” says Mr Chia.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, we get too caught up in the here and now, and fail to consider
what goes on behind the scenes, or how pieces fit into the bigger puzzle."</p>
<p>His wish list: Weatherproof drones in future.</p>
<p>"It’s quite a bummer when you have take a pass on a drone shot because
it’s pouring rain or snow."</p>
<h3><strong>2. Mapping our planet</strong></h3>
<p>To better understand Earth’s geological history, some scientists have
taken to the skies. Dr Wang Yu, a research fellow at the Nanyang Technological
University’s Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), uses drones to carry
out low-altitude aerial photo surveys.</p>
<p>"Modern drone technology, together with advanced photogrammetry [the use
of photography for surveying], has allowed us to generate very high-resolution
digital elevation models," he explains.</p>
<p>"We use these models to illustrate the form of the landscape, so that
we can detect existing surface features that are associated with earthquakes
that have occurred in the past."</p>
<p>Compared to satellite imaging and regular aerial photography, drones are
affordable, versatile and easily accessible, Dr Wang says.</p>
<p>They do, however, have limitations for now — they cannot carry heavy survey
instruments, and their short flight times limit the survey area on each
mission, he adds.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Saving lives</strong></h3>
<p>In the aftermath of natural disasters, speed is critical for saving lives.</p>
<p>However, getting to the victims of earthquakes and forest fires can be
difficult if access routes are cut off, and if rescue services face manpower
shortages during large-scale crises.</p>
<p>Uninhibited by obstructions on the ground, drones can hover over disaster
sites to provide live video feeds that help identify survivors. This method
of remote monitoring mitigates the risk that rescue workers are exposed
to.</p>
<p>They can also focus their efforts on specific locations rather than canvass
a large area.</p>
<p>Disaster-prone countries such as Japan have started integrating drones
into their disaster management operations.</p>
<p>In October 2016, Japan's National Fire and Disaster Management Agency
invested 2.5 million yen in a drone that can be equipped with either a
camera or a gas sensor for disaster reconnaissance.</p>
<p>There is a precedent: After the Nepal earthquake in April 2015, the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/nepal-earthquake-april-2015" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UK sent search and rescue teams</a>that were equipped with drones to help
search for survivors.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Detecting defects</strong></h3>
<p>Lofty towers, massive bridges and expansive transport networks are the
hallmarks of modern cities, and their physical stability is of paramount
importance.</p>
<p>Regular inspections to identify flaws in structural integrity are traditionally
done manually. This poses safety risks to personnel, and increases the
chances of subjective reporting of defects.</p>
<p>Enter the BlackLion-168, a drone purpose-built by Singapore-based <a href="https://www.aerolion.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AeroLion Technologies (ALT)</a> for
building inspections.</p>
<p>"Drone technology makes inspections objective and allows coverage of hard-to-access
areas such as pitched rooftops, tunnels and the underside of bridges. With
image analytics, defects can be auto-detected in the images gathered by
the drone's high-resolution cameras," says Mr Nicholas Yu, ALT’s business
development manager.</p>
<p>One challenge of operating drones in Singapore: Ensuring that, in accordance
with regulations, no one is standing under the drone during the inspection,
says Mr Yu.</p>
<p>He offers a simple solution: cordon off the worksite and let the drone
do its job.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Delivering items</strong></h3>
<p>Drones can help to overcome the reliance of traditional postal services
on land routes and manpower.</p>
<p>But their airworthiness must be proved before they can be used for delivery.</p>
<p>This entails rigorous testing of their endurance limits, and ensuring
the security of their navigation system. Authentication protocols are also
needed to ensure that the payload is released only to the intended recipient.</p>
<p>In October 2015, Singapore Post (SingPost) completed a first-in-the-world
trial that fulfilled all the above conditions.</p>
<p>SingPost also recently announced that it is <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/airbus-helicopters-partners-singpost-for-drone-delivery-trials-8735504" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">partnering Airbus Helicopters</a> to
further explore the feasibility of drone delivery in urban contexts.</p>
<p>And with companies like Amazon pushing the envelope, we can't wait to
see what else will be delivered.</p>
<p>So when it comes to applications for drone technology, the sky is clearly
the limit — as long as the necessary safety checks and feasibility studies
have been conducted, of course.</p>
