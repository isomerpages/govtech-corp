<h3>Restarting an economy during a pandemic is no simple task, which is why the Singapore Government is crowdsourcing for digital solutions to address COVID-19-related challenges.</h3>
<p>Like many other countries hit by COVID-19, Singapore implemented ‚Äúcircuit
breaker‚Äù measures in an attempt to contain the disease. While necessary
and effective, keeping the economy at a virtual standstill cannot be sustained
indefinitely.</p>
<p>With the circuit breaker now drawing to a close, yet another challenge
arises: How can we reopen the economy while keeping the coronavirus at
bay? Technology could very well be part of the answer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe last thing we want is to have another circuit breaker implemented,‚Äù
said Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Government Chief Digital Technology Officer. He
was speaking at a STACK-X webinar titled ‚ÄúHack the Crisis‚Äù, a session promoting
the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.gov.sg/covid-volunteering/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">COVID-19 Idea Sprint</a>,
a hackathon organised to crowdsource solutions for COVID-19-related challenges.</p>
<p>Speaking alongside him on the webinar was Mr Tan Kok Yam, Deputy Secretary
for Smart Nation and Digital Government, and Mr David Chua, Cluster Director
(Health) at the Ministry of Health. Together, they discussed the challenges
of reopening the economy and the role of technology in these trying times.</p>
<h3>The hurdle ahead</h3>
<p>According to Mr Tan, one of the main challenges to restarting the economy
is coming to terms that the pandemic will not be resolved any time soon.
‚ÄúA second or third wave of infection is still possible,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUntil
an effective vaccine is developed, COVID-19 will remain with us.‚Äù</p>
<p>To help the economy recover amid an ongoing pandemic, the government plans
to leverage digital technology to improve three areas: COVID-19 testing,
contact tracing and safety measures against potential outbreaks. While
these areas are most immediately relevant to public health, Mr Tan said
that they may bubble into economic and social spheres as well, creating
other problems that could use digital solutions too.</p>
<p>For example, the COVID-19 Idea Sprint is also crowdsourcing digital solutions
to help the public overcome isolation and mental health issues. These solutions
can manifest in forms that assist more vulnerable groups, like helping
seniors access healthcare or students with their educational needs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat is the way to reopen the economy in a risk-managed manner?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúHow do I decide between opening up one sector versus another?‚Äù In times
like these, Mr Tan said that such questions will require fresh ideas and
solutions, which they hope the public can contribute to.</p>

<h3>Solutions for a pandemic economy</h3>
<p>While no substitute for public health measures, the role of technology
in this global pandemic cannot be discounted. Digital tools have enabled
workplaces to continue operations and people to interact with one another
even in a time of isolation. It is therefore unsurprising that the government
is looking to crowdsource digital solutions that will help smoothen the
journey forward.</p>
<p>Take, for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a>,
the contact tracing application developed by GovTech in March. The app
logs users who have been in close proximity with one another, allowing
authorities to track down potential cases if any user has tested positive
for COVID-19. This would enable authorities to act swiftly and contain
the virus to prevent another wave of outbreak while the economy is recovering.
‚ÄúCurrently, contact tracing is a very manual, laborious and inefficient
process. TraceTogether is one of those technologies that we are depending
on to make contact tracing more efficient,‚Äù said Mr Chua.</p>
<p>Even so, a solution like this has challenges, like getting it to work
on different mobile devices or achieving a wide enough user base. As such,
Mr Chan said that they are looking at alternative solutions for contact
tracing, too, such as retrieving insights from different data sources or
using predictive analytics to identify viral clusters and risky behaviours.
With crowdsourcing, these possibilities could potentially bear fruit.</p>
<h3>Technology and policy hand-in-hand</h3>
<p>With digital solutions for contact tracing and other public health issues,
a key concern is maintaining data privacy and meeting existing safety regulations
for medically sensitive information. During the webinar, several attendees
voiced the need for the government to define these boundaries more clearly.</p>
<p>In response to this issue, Mr Tan said that the government‚Äôs stance has
remained largely consistent, ‚ÄúWe take what is needed to do the job, and
nothing more.‚Äù He added that, as a matter of principle, the collaboration
in this open call for solutions does not have to be unidirectional. ‚ÄúTechnological
solutions have an impact on policy, and if we prove that a certain approach
requires a certain set of data to be effective, then it can affect the
policy itself.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rather than feel restricted by the requirements to maintain the highest
level of privacy, solution providers should adopt a problem-solving mindset,
he said, suggesting ideas that tackle the core of the problems described
by authorities. In this way, technology can help to effect change‚Äînot just
in public policy‚Äîbut also in how the economy is restarted.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are facing a multifaceted problem that goes beyond just technology,
and we are stretched,‚Äù said Mr Chan. ‚ÄúSo, we are reaching out to the community
now; those of you who have been displaced by COVID-19 or want to do your
bit for the country: join us; we are hiring. This is an open call: Help
us battle the crisis; help us get back to normal.‚Äù</p>
