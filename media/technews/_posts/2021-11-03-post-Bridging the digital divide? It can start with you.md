<p>There are two well-known trends in Singapore. One, the country is in the
midst of transforming itself into a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation</a>,
harnessing technology to improve the standard of living. Two, its population
is ageing, with life expectancy growing and birth rates remaining low.</p>
<p>These factors have given rise to worries about the digital divide, where
seniors become unable to navigate a world where technology is increasingly
prominent. Even as we digitalise and enjoy the benefits of tech, commentators
have pointed out that it is important to ensure that those who are unfamiliar
with tech are not left behind.</p>

<h3>Why talk about it now?</h3>
<p>Of course, the digital divide is not a new phenomenon, and it has received
attention over the years.</p>
<p>But the challenge has taken on greater urgency since the Covid-19 pandemic
struck, supercharging the pace of digitalisation.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/73-singapore-businesses-speeding-digitalisation-amid-covid-19-study" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nearly three in four businesses</a>&nbsp;in
Singapore have sped up digitalisation efforts and with the virus still
rampant globally, digitalisation of business processes will continue and
are likely to become permanent.</p>
<p>In a world of social distancing, everyday undertakings such as going to
the bank become a greater chore, what with the wearing of masks and longer
queues. Those who are not comfortable with online transactions will have
to endure these discomforts. And should circuit breakers become necessary
again, they will not have the entertainment (video streaming), communication
(video calls), and convenience (food delivery apps) available to the digitally
savvy.</p>
<p>As more activities shift online, bad actors are seeing more opportunities
to strike, with the total number of scam cases reported to the police in
2020&nbsp;rising by more than 60 per cent&nbsp;compared to 2019. As a result,
those who are already not confident about their digital skills face the
worry of falling victim to fraud, further turning them off technology.</p>
<h3>Difficulties that seniors face using tech</h3>
<p>Firstly, many of the tech tools we take for granted are not simple for
the elderly. Using a mouse to move the cursor may not be intuitive to them
and they may initially struggle with how to even grip a mouse, akin to
how the steering wheel is tricky for beginner drivers.&nbsp;Poor vision
and lack of fine motor skills&nbsp;also make the use of smartphones a chore
rather than a pleasure.</p>
<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, seniors must see a reason to go
online in the first place. For instance, many internet users view the latest
blockbusters and TV series on streaming services. But if such programmes
donâ€™t appeal to the senior in question, be it due to language or taste
preferences, then they might not see the point of going online. Similarly,
if their friends and social networks are not online, the internet would
seem to be a boring place.</p>
<h3>Building a bridge</h3>
<p>Efforts are being made by the government under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/seniors-go-digital" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Seniors Go Digital</a> programme
to bridge the digital divide.</p>
<p>For instance, the government set up&nbsp;SG Digital Community Hubs&nbsp;islandwide
last year staffed with digital ambassadors to provide one-to-one assistance.
The hubs are aimed at seniors and hawkers to help them pick up common apps
like SingPass and WhatsApp, and to set up e-payment tools. You can find
a list of the hubs&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>There are also&nbsp;classroom&nbsp;and&nbsp;online&nbsp;learning programmes
for more specific lessons.</p>
<p>To tackle the lack of digital access, the&nbsp;Mobile Access for Seniors&nbsp;scheme
provides subsidised smartphones and mobile plans for seniors who want to
go digital but cannot afford to do so.</p>
<h3>Loved ones make the biggest difference</h3>
<p>Ultimately, those closest to the seniors are the ones who can make the
biggest difference. Family members especially can help seniors build interest
in online activities and by being there to guide them.</p>
<p>Form a family chat group in chat apps and get the elderly involved in
online conversations. Better still, video call them regularly so they have
a reason to keep their skills fresh. After all, whatever they pick up in
that hour-long lesson will soon be forgotten if they donâ€™t use them.</p>
<p>So, if you have elderly family members and youâ€™re reading this, just remember
that you can, with patience and constant engagement, you can do your part
in bridging the digital divide in Singapore.</p>
