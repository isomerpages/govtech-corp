<p>Last month, we launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.life.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LifeSG</a>&nbsp;‚Äì an upgraded, rebranded
and enhanced version of the app formerly known as Moments of Life. At GovTech,
we‚Äôre big believers in journaling, so instead of just sharing with you
all the new features (there are plenty!), we thought we would also write
about the process and the lessons we learned along the way.</p>

<h3>LifeSG was first conceived for newborns</h3>
<p>Every app has an origin story, and LifeSG‚Äôs started somewhat poetically
for people just starting their lives ‚Äì newborn babies and their parents.</p>
<p>The idea was simple. New parents find it stressful because there‚Äôs a lot
of paperwork to be done when a baby enters the world. The first version
of our app aimed to help by providing information about birth registration,
and immunisation records, and it has also helped simplify the entire process
from birth registration to the Baby Bonus application by cutting down the
time users typically need to spend (from 60 minutes to 15 minutes!).</p>
<p>Now, we don‚Äôt want to brag, but since its inception in 2018, seven in
10 Singaporean births have been registered using this app ‚Äì a fact that
we‚Äôre very proud of!</p>
<p>That said, we knew the demand for government digital services wasn‚Äôt going
to stop there. After all, newborns and their parents were just one segment
of our diverse population.</p>
<p>How could we provide the same level of utility and accessibility to everyone
else?</p>
<h3>Having one consolidated app wasn‚Äôt always on our minds</h3>
<p>In the planning stage, we considered having multiple applications for
different segments of the population ‚Äì one for seniors, one for working
adults, one for parents.</p>
<p>This approach had several advantages ‚Äì individual apps are faster to develop,
and simpler to design ‚Äì but we soon came to realise a citizen often wears
many hats.</p>
<p>For example: A user can be a father, a vehicle owner, working a 9-5 job,
as well as a volunteer on weekends.</p>
<p>That means if we went down the route of individual apps, they would have
to download 6 to 10 different applications just to transact with the government.</p>
<p>As of May 2019, there were some 170 affiliated government apps available
‚Äì an impressive array of services, no doubt ‚Äì but once you take into consideration
the differences in learning curve, hassle of using multiple apps and the
cost of maintaining these apps, the cons really started to add up.</p>
<p>Even if they didn‚Äôt use apps, having to navigate across multiple websites
and services can lead to citizens getting lost, frustrated or being bombarded
with information they can‚Äôt process.</p>
<h3>That‚Äôs why we created LifeSG to make life easier</h3>
<p>The thinking behind LifeSG is simple: the less time citizens spend transacting
with the government, the more time they get to focus on the things they
love.</p>
<p>To make that a reality, we‚Äôve created one app with one user interface,
one simplified user experience across all multiple government services
‚Äì learning to use the app will be easy, and actually using it will be even
easier.</p>
<p>Of course, being simple to use is not enough reason for someone to use
an app. To that end, we‚Äôve focused on two things.</p>
<h4>1. Relevance through Curation</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Based on their selection and profile, the app will push out relevant information on LifeSG to citizens." src="/images/technews/Moments_of_Life_is_now_LifeSG_1.jpg">
</div>
<p><em>Based on their selection and profile, the app will push out relevant information on LifeSG to citizens.</em>
</p>
<p>Citizens are busy people with limited time and attention. They are also
an incredibly diverse group of people, each with different needs.</p>
<p>To stay in their hearts and the coveted position on their phones, we built
the app around their individual needs so they‚Äôll find it relevant and useful
to them.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we‚Äôve created a recommendation engine that pushes
relevant information based on their profile and selected interests.</p>

</div>
<p>For example, a working adult will receive information about employment
support to find out how they can go about making a career switch or even
make arrangements to meet a career coach. If they are also a parent with
a young child, they will also get info about the annual MOE Primary 1 registration
exercise when it is available.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<h4>2. One app, over 40 services</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="40+ services on the LifeSG app" src="/images/technews/Moments_of_Life_is_now_LifeSG_3.jpg">
</div>
<p><em>40+ services in one app! Trust us, this wasn‚Äôt easy to pull off.</em>
</p>
<p>Remember when we said having many different apps could be confusing? So
far, LifeSG is bundling more than 40 digital government services in one
app ‚Äì and more are on the way.</p>
<p>Marie Kondo would be proud.</p>
<p>By bundling services based on user needs with large, easy-to-understand
icons, citizens can now easily navigate to where they need to be.</p>
<p>Making a CPF Nomination? Easy.</p>
<p>Checking your eligibility for government support grants? No problem.</p>
<p>In the future, we‚Äôll also be continuously adding on relevant services
for people of different life stages, whether it‚Äôs newly-weds, fresh grads
or retirees.</p>
<p>All in a matter of time!</p>

</div>
<p><em>During the era of COVID-19, it is important to enable citizens to get the help they need in the simplest way possible</em>.</p>
<p>Stay tuned ‚Äì and we‚Äôd love to hear from you!</p>
<p>Well, that‚Äôs the story so far, but as you know, in tech ‚Äì things are always
changing. As tech folks, we‚Äôre used to constantly fixing, rewiring, experimenting
‚Äì and then repeating that all over again.</p>
<p>So here‚Äôs how you can help us make the app even better for you:</p>
<p>Try our new app, play with the features and give it a spin. Then let us
know what could be better.</p>
<p>Because if there‚Äôs one thing we‚Äôve learnt, it‚Äôs that user feedback is
important. And in Singapore ‚Äì everyone is a user of LifeSG.</p>
