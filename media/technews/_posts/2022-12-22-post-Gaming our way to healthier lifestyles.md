<p>The festive season is upon us! And we get it. With temptations all around
us, it can be hard to live healthy!</p>
<p>In recent years, more programmes incorporating gaming elements have been
launched to keep us motivated to stay in shape. If you‚Äôre looking for some
inspiration to work off the extra weight gain from festive feasting, read
on!</p>

<p>Can you believe there have already been seven seasons of the&nbsp;National
Steps Challenge? The world‚Äôs first population-level fitness tracker-based
physical activity initiative started in 2015 as a way to get Singaporeans
moving. The premise is simple: the more steps you take ‚Äì which is where
the fitness tracker comes in ‚Äì the more rewards you earn.</p>
<p>Its popularity shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise.&nbsp;Studies&nbsp;have shown
that gamification can motivate people to start and continue actions that
benefit their health and well-being.</p>
<h3>1. Healthy 365 app</h3><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://pphtpc.hpb.gov.sg/h365-app/home?a=b/"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Healthy 365 mobile app to improve overall health and well-being via points system" src="/images/technews/Healthy365_app.jpg"></a>
<p>We would be remiss if we didn‚Äôt start by mentioning this app that powers
the National Steps Challenge. It is where users log their steps, earn points,
and exchange them for rewards such as grocery vouchers.</p>
<p>But did you know that Healthy 365 can also motivate you to adopt a healthier
diet? The Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/136/eat-drink-shop-healthy-challenge" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Challenge</a>&nbsp;rewards
you for doing just that. When you make healthier choices at participating
outlets ‚Äì perhaps buying teh-O at the Kopitiam or picking fresh milk instead
of soda at the supermarket ‚Äì you receive a special receipt with a QR code.</p>
<p>Scan that code with your Healthy 365 app, and you earn health points that
can be exchanged for discounts. Accumulate enough healthier choice purchases
to unlock sure-win rewards.</p>
<p>Plans are also afoot to increase the usefulness of the health points.
In April 2022, GovTech and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) announced a&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sme/dbs-partners-govtech-nets-hpb-to-launch-digital-payment-method-for-healthier-fb-options" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">partnership</a>&nbsp;with DBS and NETs to work on making the Healthy 365
app a digital payment tool. Health points can be converted into health
credits that can then be used directly to buy healthier items at participating
outlets, much like how QR-based cashless payments are done now.</p>
<p>Over 2,500 food and beverages merchants are expected to join the programme
and start accepting the credits by end-March 2023.</p>

<h3>2. Lumi Health</h3><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://www.lumihealth.sg/"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Lumi Health screenshot from website showing how the app is compatible with IPhone and Apple watch" src="/images/technews/LumiHealth_screenshot.jpg"></a>
<p><a href="https://www.lumihealth.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LumiHealth</a> is
a health programme developed by HPB together with Apple. Because it rides
on many features of the Apple Watch, it is open to only users of that particular
wearable device.</p>
<p>The overarching game within the app involves helping a cute animated figure
by the name of Lu advance in its journey, much like a character in a video
game. How does Lu move along? It‚Äôs powered by LumiPoints that you earn
by completing activities ranging from walking to yoga and well-being challenges
like meditation and diet goals.</p>
<p>Wearers of Apple Watches also log more data with the device, enabling
it to push out customised challenges.</p>
<p>As Lu progresses across the digital landscape, it unlocks coins that can
be exchanged for e-vouchers.</p>
<h3>3. hiSG</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôve always wanted to get in-depth insights into your health and
lifestyle, then the Health Insights Singapore (hiSG)&nbsp;<a href="https://hpb.gov.sg/healthy-living/hisg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">study</a>&nbsp;may
be just the thing for you.</p>
<p>The goal of the study is to collect lifestyle and behavioural data across
various health topics such as physical activity, nutrition, and mental
well-being. HPB is seeking participants who can commit to a minimum of
two years, during which they should wear a fitness tracker ‚Äì which will
be issued to them ‚Äì as much as possible, answer questionnaires, and log
their meals in an app.</p>
<p>Usage of the device will also earn participants HPB health points, which
as you know by now, can be used to redeem rewards.</p>
<p>At the end of the two years, participants will get free health insights
and also get to keep the device, which is a Fitbit Versa 2 smartwatch.</p>
<p>Do note that participants need to make a $50 deposit that will be refunded
for two years upon successfully participating in the study. During the
24-month period, there are minimum requirements that participants need
to hit (such as the number of days wearing the device per month). You‚Äôll
forfeit your $50 deposit should you fail to hit the target.</p>
<h3>Gaming for good</h3>
<p>Anyone who‚Äôs ever played a game of Candy Crush knows there‚Äôs a mental
rush whenever a level is cleared, even if it really means nothing in real
life. Gamification takes those positive emotions of accomplishments and
channels them towards activities that will have an actual impact on your
health.</p>
<p>So, if you‚Äôve ever found yourself wanting to exercise but giving in to
the temptation of playing mobile games instead, why not do both by firing
up one of the apps above? This is one of the few moments in life when you
can have your cake and eat it!</p>
