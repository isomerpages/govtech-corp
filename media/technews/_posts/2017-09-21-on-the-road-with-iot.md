<p>Transportation systems are evolving to meet the needs of a world on the
move, and networks are playing a key role.</p>
<p>From high-speed trains to self-driving cars, transportation systems are
harnessing the power of Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to increase
safety, reduce congestion and energy use, and improve operational performance.</p>
<p>Singapore was one of the pioneers in implementing electronic congestion
charging to manage traffic jams, institutionalizing the Electronic Road
Pricing (ERP) scheme in 1998.</p>
<p>The nation has since gone full circle, and has plans to launch a satellite-based
ERP system.</p>
<p>This is part of the government’s <a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/roads-and-motoring/managing-traffic-and-congestion/intelligent-transport-systems/SmartMobility2030.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Mobility 2030</a> blueprint,
which was unveiled in 2014.</p>
<p>The plan seeks to create a safer and better travel experience for users
through interactive elements and technology. The plan also shared aspirations
for driverless buses and talking cars.</p>
<p>We are 13 years away from 2030, but how near are we to a truly Intelligent
Transport System (ITS)?</p>
<h3><strong>IoT and transportation</strong></h3>
<p>One area of our lives that is being impacted on a massive scale by the
IoT is the field of transportation.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that we would all like to see automobile commuters freed
up by 90 percent to either relax, play games, sleep, or maybe catch up
on some work, while en route to and from their jobs rather than fighting
the all-too-prevalent traffic jam.</p>
<p>Dare we dream that over the next 13 years, an improvement in efficiency
of movement — getting from point A to point B — by 75 percent for all manner
of travelers is achievable?</p>
<p>Why not shoot for the moon and let’s go for a reduction in vehicle-related
fatalities by 99 percent compared to current levels by 2030?</p>
<p>Could you get behind these lofty goals?</p>
<p>ITS just might make all of these things happen, and they will do it by
harnessing the power of IoT.</p>
<h3><strong>Smarter roads</strong></h3>
<p>ITS serves the role of communicating information about an array of road
conditions.</p>
<p>In particular, travelers and first responders will be provided with dynamic,
contextually-relevant instructions that suggest the appropriate action
required.</p>
<p>How do they work?</p>
<p>Roadside sensors and cameras gather data about traffic, weather, and other
environmental conditions supported by a vast network of communication pipes
that parallel the roads themselves enabling them to respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Instructions can be sent to digital signage that may include messages
for travelers about conditions ahead or the system may simply change the
street signaling pattern to adjust traffic flow conditions.</p>
<p>The posted speed limit can also be changed accordingly, alerting drivers
to slow down during wet weather.</p>
<p>In time, systems will communicate directly with vehicles, which by then
will be largely self-driven, and vehicles will adjust their speed and traveling
behaviour to optimally-respond to prevailing conditions.</p>
<p>These systems constitute the most advanced expression of the vehicles’
information highways. Demands being placed on these information highways
are exponentially growing in both volume and complexity.</p>
<p>This calls for significant reinvention and upgrading of traditional ITS
infrastructures and, like the rest of the world, the transportation sector
has come around to recognize the virtues of IP.</p>
<p>They need the right network infrastructure tools to provide a robust and
reasonably administered ITS network to accommodate the explosion of the
IoT on our roads.</p>
<h3><strong>Realizing Smart Mobility 2030</strong></h3>
<p>The Singapore government is well ahead of the curve when it comes to scoping
out and beginning to build the ITS network to accommodate the future IoT.</p>
<p>However, what do urban planners in Singapore and elsewhere need to consider
when evaluating the right network infrastructure tools to leverage?</p>
<p>Here are some of the key factors involved:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Environmental conscientiousness — The chosen network needs to be built
to handle whatever the elements throw at it: Harsh temperatures, vibration,
and dust conditions. In short, it’s built for the road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resiliency — The chosen network should offer unmatched redundancy and
availability for robust deployment topologies such as rings, stars, and
mesh configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended IoT lifecycle — The chosen network needs to be able to handle
today’s cameras and sensors and those that are being designed and built
for tomorrow. Support for 1G and 10G uplinks is required to ensure an upgrade
path for the bandwidth requirements of tomorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ease of deployment and maintenance — The chosen network should offer elegant,
automated, virtually zero touch deployment options, along with powerful
and easy-to-use monitoring and control.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore is set to host the <a href="https://itssingapore.org.sg/cms/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">26th ITS World Congress in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>With the right network infrastructure tools, delegates to the ITS World
Congress might just travel in style via driverless and talking vehicles
when in Singapore.</p>
<p>Now that is one scenario worth driving well.</p>
