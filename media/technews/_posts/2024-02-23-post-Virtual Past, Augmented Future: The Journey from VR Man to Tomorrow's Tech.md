<p>A long, long time ago in 1998, a series called ‚ÄúVR Man‚Äù graced the silver
screen in Singapore.</p>
<p>VR Man, Singapore‚Äôs first superhero ‚Äì played by 90s heartthrob James Lye
‚Äì got his name from his primary power: The ability to project ‚ÄòVirtual
Reality‚Äô objects into the real world ‚Äì aka ‚ÄòVirping.‚Äô</p>
<p>But here‚Äôs the thing: by today‚Äôs standards, the name ‚ÄòVR Man‚Äô would probably
have left many confused. Why? Because strictly speaking, his powers would
be considered AR or Augmented Reality.</p>
<p>Of course, ‚ÄòAR Man‚Äô doesn‚Äôt have quite the same ring to it, huh? Not to
mention, AR wasn‚Äôt a popular term in 1998.</p>
<p>Well, if all you know about VR are vague notions of the clunky, goofy-looking
goggles, and if AR is just as foreign a concept, then you‚Äôve come to the
right place.</p>
<p>Here, we explain and demystify both terms and discuss what the future
holds.</p>

<h3>1. What is the origin story of VR?</h3>
<p>In 1965, computer scientist Ivan Sutherland articulated the concept of
an ‚Äúultimate display‚Äù, where a head-mounted display could simulate reality
to the point where one could not differentiate it from actual reality.</p>
<p>Three years later, he created the first such head-mounted display that
was connected to a computer. Called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/input-output/14/356/1888" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sword of Damocles</a>,
it was suspended from the ceiling (hence earning its moniker) and was strapped
to the user, who could then view rudimentary computer-generated graphics
of wireframe rooms and objects.</p>
<p>This was technically the first attempt at VR.</p>
<p>In Sutherland‚Äôs own words:</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúThe ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal. With appropriate programming, such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked.‚Äù</em>
</p>
<h3>2. What about the origin story of AR?</h3>
<p>The term was&nbsp;<a href="/media/technews/5-things-to-know-about-arvr" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">coined</a>&nbsp;in
1990 by a couple of Boeing researchers who came up with an idea to replace
the use of large plywood boards containing wiring instructions for different
aircraft being built.</p>
<p>They suggested a head-mounted display for construction workers that projected
the cable positions onto multipurpose, reusable boards, kickstarting the
use of AR in industrial settings.</p>
<h3>3. But what is the difference between AR and VR?</h3>
<p>VR immerses users in a completely artificial, computer-generated environment.
Those goggles are big and clunky for a reason ‚Äì they cover the user‚Äôs entire
field of vision so that he or she is transported to a simulated world,
complete with interactive elements and environments. The user‚Äôs body movements
are tracked, and the visual display is adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, instead of presenting a completely digital environment,
AR overlays digital information into the real world. This enhances the
user‚Äôs perception of everyday scenes by adding images and videos to their
field of view.</p>
<p>AR is usually experienced through the cameras in mobile devices or specially
designed AR glasses.</p>
<p>A prominent example of AR is the&nbsp;<a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/hc/en/6-pokemon-go/faq/28-catching-pokemon-in-ar-mode/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon Go</a>&nbsp;game,
where players can spot and catch Pokemon by pointing their phone cameras
at their surroundings.</p>

<p>In addition, VR is well-suited for transplanting a user into a completely
fictional, digital world, and so has uses in gaming and simulation. On
the other hand, AR shines when interacting with the real world, so education
and navigation are instances where it can prove useful.</p>
<h3>4. How about some real-life examples of both pieces of technology being used?</h3>
<p>For starters, there is a long line of VR products in the realm of gaming,
such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-sg/ps-vr/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>&nbsp;VR
headset and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/products/quest-2/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Oculus</a>&nbsp;series
of headsets for PC gaming.</p>
<p>VR is also being used for better healthcare outcomes in the medical industry.
Surgeons at the George Washington University Hospital in the US use an
<a href="https://www.gwhospital.com/conditions-services/surgery/precision-virtual-reality" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">advanced virtual reality tool</a>&nbsp;to explore a patient‚Äôs brain and
body before operating.</p>

<p>VR headsets have also proven to be effective in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-children-in-the-hospital-vr-may-be-the-cure-for-anxiety-1527559995" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">diminishing pain and anxiety</a>&nbsp;in
patients as they undergo procedures such as wound cleaning and injections.</p>
<p>As for AR, museums have been using the technology to enliven their displays
and tell more vivid stories.</p>
<p>In 2017, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/national-museum-of-singapore-uses-augmented-reality-to-tell-buildings-history" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Museum of Singapore</a>&nbsp;used
AR to give a sense of what the building used to look like and some of the
exhibits it housed. Visitors were given smartphones that they could use
to view certain artefacts, such as a 42-foot-long Indian Fin Whale skeleton!</p>
<p>In 2022, there was even an AR tour of what Singapore will be like in 2122
if sea levels rise and flood the island.</p>
<p>Most recently, Google‚Äôs ARCore partnered with the Singapore Tourism Board
using Google‚Äôs new Geospatial Creator in Unity to create an immersive,
AR-guided tour.</p>
<p>Users get to follow Merli, Singapore‚Äôs tourism mascot, on an immersive
tour of Singapore‚Äôs iconic landmarks! Attractions include Merlion Park,
Victoria Concert Hall, and Maxwell Food Centre.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">
<iframe style="max-width: 100%;" height="400" width="100%" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFxpXiAkT2k?si=-3NFz7VS6IJzi9yR"></iframe>
</div>
<p>Education is another field to which AR can be applied.</p>
<p>For example, Apple offers suggested lesson&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/sg/education/docs/ar-in-edu-lesson-ideas.pdf" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">plans</a>&nbsp;to
accompany the use of AR with iPads. Having trouble with geometry? Perhaps
creating 3D shapes that students can walk around will help them better
visualise mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>The technology has also been used to convey the dramatic effects of climate
change through a project titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hPP0cHHubM&amp;t=158s" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Unmoored.</a>&nbsp;Using
the HoloLens headset and a custom mobile phone AR app, visitors to New
York City‚Äôs Times Square can experience what it‚Äôs like for that iconic
space to be completely submerged in water.</p>
<p>Finally, one thing that needs to be said is that as technology improves,
our idea of what counts as virtual reality evolves as well. For example,
some 1990s arcade classics,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Bw-pgZcVo" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Virtua Cop</a>&nbsp;and
Virtua Fighter, might have been considered shining examples of VR in the
past.</p>
<p>(Of course, no marketer would slap the word ‚Äúvirtua‚Äù (L or no L) on these
titles today.)</p>
<h3>5. What does the future hold for these tools?</h3>
<p>What do sci-fi films depict when they want to deliver a sense that future
societies have reached a super advanced state of technology?</p>
<p>Floating screens that can be manipulated with gestures, a la the hit movie
Minority Report!</p>
<p>Well, that future may just be around the corner judging from this&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sightful-spacetop-augmented-reality-laptop-hands-on-news/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AR laptop</a>&nbsp;that packs a virtual 100-inch screen that can display
multiple windows and apps. What‚Äôs more, it doesn‚Äôt require massive hardware,
consisting of a pair of AR glasses connected to a keyboard with a touchpad.</p>
<p>More recently, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also posted a video on Instagram,
teasing VR tech that can turn any flat surface into a virtual keyboard.</p>
<p>With so many players vying to make VR and AR more a part of everyday life,
we can be sure that these technologies will continue advancing, whether
or not the newly launched Apple Vision Pro proves to be a hit.</p>
<h3>Cool ‚Äì any parting words before I go try out some VR/AR?</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, technology is ever-changing and hence what counts
as VR and AR evolves too. Try not to get caught up in strict definitions,
as the lines between VR and AR blur over time.</p>
<p>Most importantly, go out there and have fun with VR and AR! Nothing beats
first-hand experience with a pair of VR goggles or peering through an AR
camera lens.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll end up learning even more about these pieces of technology than
what this article can teach you. And then you can start imagining the possibilities
and potential of a digital reality!</p>
