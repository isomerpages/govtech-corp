<p><em>Read on for some tools that will help you get things done! </em>
</p>
<p>One of the reasons tech exists is to make our lives easier. Automation,
simplifying stuff, reducing laborious chores&nbsp;<strong>—</strong>&nbsp;these
are all associated with tech.</p>
<p>Well, making tech work for you is not just for techies. With the increasing
number of productivity tools out there, you too can leverage tech and turn
from a workhorse to a productivity powerhouse.</p>
<p>We have broken down the products into two categories: those that help
you stay organised and those that help you stay focused.</p>
<h3>Staying organised</h3>
<p>1)&nbsp;<a href="https://trello.com/en" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trello</a>
</p>
<p>The whiteboard filled with colourful sticky notes is a favourite in the
tech industry for project organisation, and Trello is the digital version.
A trello board is usually organised into three columns: what needs to be
done, what’s in the process of being done, and what’s completed. You can
create and rename columns as you wish.</p>
<p>In each of the columns are what’s known as cards, and yes, they can be
colour-coded, just like the real-life post-it notes. Each card lists a
task and who’s in charge of it. Cards can be moved in and out of columns
with a simple drag-and-drop using the mouse.</p>
<p>Besides being really easy to use, Trello also integrates with many third-party
services such as Slack, Twitter, Github, and Survey Monkey. The Trello
board thus gives the team an easy overview of what everyone else is working
on and what’s the progress of each task.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;<a href="https://evernote.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Evernote</a>
</p>
<p>When it comes to taking notes, sometimes it’s easier to record an audio
reminder. Sometimes it’s easier to snap a photo of what you want to remember.
Sometimes a sketch paints a thousand words. And sometimes the best way
is just to type a few words.</p>
<p>Evernote allows note taking in all those forms. It is also able to recognise
text in pictures, meaning it can read and process handwritten notes that
you scan into the app. All your notes are synced across your devices as
well, although the free tier allows just two devices.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;<a href="https://ifttt.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IFTTT</a>
</p>
<p>This automation tool takes care of small, mundane tasks that you’ll otherwise
be wasting minutes on. How does it do so? Well, the clue is in its name
IFTTT, which stands for “if this, then that”.</p>
<p>So you can create custom automations such as “if there’s a new post published
on my WordPress site, then share it on Facebook”. Or “if the weather forecast
says it’s going to rain, text me a reminder to pack an umbrella”. Such
automations can be made either through IFTTT’s web-based service or mobile
app.</p>
<p>Before plunging straight into building a customisation, checking out the
pre-built customisations on the IFTTT website may save you from reinventing
the wheel. Oh, by the way, the pronunciation of IFTTT rhymes with “gift”.</p>
<h3>Staying Focused</h3>
<p>1)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">RescueTime</a>
</p>
<p>This tool does what its name suggests and rescues your time from being
wasted. It does this by automatically tracking the time you spend on different
apps and websites, and then categorising them from “very productive” to
“very distracting”.</p>
<p>The result: A precise dashboard of where the time drains are that you
need to get rid of. The shock factor alone of how those tiny Instagram
breaks add up to hours upon hours might just be the motivation you need
to cut back on social media. RescueTime also comes as an app so you can
track your phone usage to see if you’re being productive or consuming too
many mindless videos.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stayfocusd.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">StayFocusd</a>
</p>
<p>Ok, so you’ve tried tracking your online activity in a bid to kick the
procrastination, but it’s not working.</p>
<p>It’s time to take things up a notch by using the StayFocusd extension.
Block certain sites once you’ve reached a limit – say, 45 minutes on Instagram
– or put those temptations off limits during periods set periods of time.</p>
<p>Yes, if you’re truly determined to waste time, then this is but a speed
bump. You could always pick up your smartphone or open another browser.
But at least you’re blocking the muscle memory of heading to these sites
and giving productivity a fighting chance.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;<a href="https://getpocket.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pocket</a>
</p>
<p>If you’re the type with countless tabs opened on your internet browser
because you just keep stumbling upon another interesting article/tweet/video
that you just don’t have the time for now, then Pocket is for you.</p>
<p>Pocket enables you to save these content for later and you can even download
content for offline consumption. That way, you can keep the distracting
content for later, save in the knowledge that you can get back to it once
you’ve finished your tasks at hand. And if the content lived up to your
expectations? Share it to another user’s Pocket!</p>
<h3>Tech is for everyone</h3>
<p>We sometimes think that working with tech must entail a steep learning
curve and picture multiple screens of code, inscrutable to all but the
most technical people. In reality, mass-market tools that come with easy-to-use,
point-and-click interfaces are now readily available for everyday users.</p>
<p>We’re now living in the boom times of tech, so even if the tools above
are somehow not to your liking, it’s highly likely there’s a similar product
from a competitor that may be better suited to your needs.</p>
<p>So go forth and be productive!</p>
