<p>If we want to talk about instant messaging, we have got to mention Blackberry.
Once so popular and addictive that it was nicknamed the Crackberry, Blackberry&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/blackberry-discontinue-service-classic" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pulled the plug</a>&nbsp;on its smartphones in January 2022.</p>
<p>The devices with physical qwerty keyboards were once the staple of white-collar
professionals and even former US president Barack Obama couldn‚Äôt <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/05/22/technology/security/nsa-obama-blackberry/index.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">put his down</a>.
And the Blackberry Messenger (BBM) ‚Äì similar to today‚Äôs iMessage ‚Äì service
ruled the roost in corporate boardrooms.</p>
<p>BBM, as the first instant messenger for mobile phones, was then deemed
superior to the delayed and expensive SMS service. Yet SMS was seen as
a revolutionary change from voice calls at one point in time.</p>
<p>And instant messaging itself has seen various shifts in how we communicate:
from plain texts to winks, voice messages to stickers. We take a look at
how instant messaging has evolved across the years.</p>

<h3>Before messaging came voice calls</h3>
<p>Remember the time when phones were just for voice calls? The first mobile
phone call was made in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/the-first-mobile-phone-call-was-made-40-years-ago-today/274611/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1973</a>,
heralding a new wave of communication. Such a momentous occasion was unfortunately
not marked by momentous words, with the conversation reportedly being mostly
pleasantries and checking whether the sound quality was good.</p>
<h3>Short Message Service, or SMS</h3>
<p>Reading text on your phone did not become a thing until almost two decades
later. In 1992, the first SMS was sent and once again, it was a banal&nbsp;
<a href="https://qz.com/33151/the-first-text-message-was-sent-20-years-ago/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Äù</a>.</p>
<p>The use of SMS grew strongly over the next twenty years, with millennials
becoming adept at tapping out messages on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_keypad" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3 X 4 numeric keyboard</a>.</p>
<p>In Singapore, SMS peaked in popularity in&nbsp;<a href="https://tnp.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/writing-wall-sms-banks-govt-groups-moving-soft-tokens" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2011</a>,
before seeing a steady decline as smartphones became increasingly adopted.</p>
<h3>Advent of instant messaging (IM)</h3>
<p>Older millennials are the first to use the internet before adulthood and
will no doubt fondly remember the first publicly available instant messenger
‚Äì&nbsp;<a href="https://history-computer.com/irc-guide/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Internet Relay Chat</a>,
better known by the initials IRC. Created in 1988, it spread globally by
1989, with real-time online conversations ‚Äì a major innovation for its
time ‚Äì taking place in so-called ‚Äúchat rooms‚Äù.</p>
<p>Other popular instant messaging programmes hit the market over the next
decade, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inc.com/tom-popomaronis/remember-icq-the-chat-pioneer-turned-20-this-year-and-lessons-learned-for-2017.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ICQ</a>&nbsp;in
1996 (which is still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icq.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">alive</a>!),&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.inc.com/tom-popomaronis/remember-icq-the-chat-pioneer-turned-20-this-year-and-lessons-learned-for-2017.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Yahoo Messenger</a>&nbsp;in 1998, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2373-msn-messenger/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MSN Messenger</a>&nbsp;in
1999.</p>
<p>Emojis were also first introduced in&nbsp;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/emoji-shigetaka-kurita-standards-manual/index.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1999</a>,
enabling people to communicate online beyond simply using text. The first
emojis fit into a 12 by 12 pixel grid and were a Japanese invention. The
word emoji itself is derived from the Japanese characters Áµµ (‚Äúe:, picture),
Êñá (‚Äúmo‚Äù, write) and Â≠ó (‚Äúji‚Äù, character).</p>
<h3>BBM ‚Äì IM hits the mobile phone</h3>
<p>Mobile phones truly became an instant messaging vehicle when BBM was introduced
to Blackberry devices in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18646429/blackberry-messenger-ending-group-chats-read-receipts-rim-apple-android-imessage" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2005</a>.
Although texting had already been ongoing for years, BBM had several advantages,
such as not being limited to 160 characters per message, having ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù
and ‚Äúread‚Äù receipts, and group chats.</p>
<p>This laid the foundation for the mobile instant messaging experience that
we are all familiar with today.</p>
<h3>Social networks get into IMs</h3>
<p>The second half of the 2000s was when social media started taking off
as a phenomenon. Over the years, platforms such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/myspace-officially-launches-instant-messaging-service/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MySpace</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c1975e8a-c372-11e0-b163-00144feabdc0" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook</a>&nbsp;launched their own messaging services, giving users
even more choices to instantly get in touch with their contacts.</p>
<p>While some would die off, others became increasingly sophisticated, with
the ability to attach photos and videos.</p>
<h3>Chat apps dominate</h3>
<p>Today, the vast majority of texting happens over chat apps. Which you
use probably depends on which service is the most popular in your country.
In Thailand, it‚Äôll be Line. In China, WeChat is what people are using.
In Singapore, WhatsApp rules.</p>
<p>Whatapps was launched in 2009, just as many users were switching over
to smartphones and discovering that, by adopting WhatsApp, they were no
longer limited by the number of free SMSes bundled by their telco. It attained
over 400 million users across the world by 2014 and was acquired by Facebook.</p>
<p>To keep its popularity, WhatsApp also steadily introduced new features
such as voice messages in 2013.</p>
<p>Another IM app that has grown in popularity in recent years is Telegram.
Although it has been in existence since 2013, it gained new prominence
in January 2021 when WhatsApp&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/whatsapp-users-idCNL4N2JJ2JC" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a>&nbsp;its
terms of service to parent company Facebook and other subsidiaries to collect
user data, including phone numbers and locations.</p>
<p>Many users were spooked and flocked to Telegram, with the app&nbsp;
<a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">announcing</a>&nbsp;that it gained 25 million new users within three days.</p>
<p>But Telegram is not just a WhatsApp replacement. Over the years, it has
offered new ways of instant messaging, such as Stickers,&nbsp;<a href="https://telegram.org/blog/gifs" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GIFs</a>,
and&nbsp;<a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-messages-and-telescope" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">video messages</a>.</p>
<h3>Not just for pleasure but also for business</h3>
<p>IM is currently an accepted way of life not just in the personal realm
but in the business space as well. Witness how Slack has taken over as
the main communication tool in many companies. Lots of firms have WhatsApp
and Facebook Messenger business accounts to communicate with customers.</p>
<p>E-commerce apps such as Shopee and Lazada have their in-built IM tool
for shoppers to talk to sellers.</p>
<p>Perhaps some day, another communication method will rise up and overtake
IM‚Äôs dominance the same way SMS has dropped in relevance. But right now,
it‚Äôs a world of IM and we‚Äôve never been chatting more.</p>
