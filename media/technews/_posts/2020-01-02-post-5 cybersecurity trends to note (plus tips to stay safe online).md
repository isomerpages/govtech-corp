<p>When Singapore rolled out its Digital Government Blueprint in June 2018,
building reliable, secure and resilient systems was earmarked as a key
priority. Aware of the risks from digitalising government systems‚Äîespecially
with the push for cloud-centric services‚Äîthe Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore
and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) have been keeping
a close eye on the global cyber threat landscape and are working with government
agencies to bolster defences and prevent security breaches.</p>
<p>TechNews spoke to Mr Shane Woo, an associate cybersecurity analyst at
GovTech, to learn about some key trends in cybersecurity and highlight
how individuals and organisations can stay safe online.</p>

<h4>1. Cryptojacking</h4>
<p>If 2017 was the year of ransomware‚Äîmalicious software that ‚Äòlocks up‚Äô
victims‚Äô computer files until a ransom is paid, then cryptojacking was
the cyberthreat flavour of the year in 2018, said Mr Woo.</p>
<p>The rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has seen cybercriminals surreptitiously
installing what is known as cryptocurrency mining bots on vulnerable computers.
These bots basically tap on the combined processing power of infected computers
to generate revenue for the hacker. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky,
cybercriminals can earn as much as US$30,000 a month using a single cryptocurrency
mining botnet.</p>
<p>How do you know if you may be a victim? Your device may be slowing down
or heating up, or its battery may be draining faster than usual. To remedy
a cryptojacking situation, try purging your browser extensions, performing
a scan of your device with updated antivirus software and using web filtering
tools to block suspicious pages.</p>
<h4>2. Social engineering</h4>
<p>Even as new cyberattack strategies emerge, others, like social engineering,
persist. A typical social engineering attack goes like this: you receive
an email that appears to be from a legitimate source, perhaps from a company
or an organisation that you‚Äôve interacted with before.</p>
<p>You click on the link, and you‚Äôre redirected to a website requesting personal
information. Only after you‚Äôve keyed in the information do you realise
that the website is not secure (not HTTPS) or has its URL misspelt‚Äîyou‚Äôve
just fallen for a phishing attack and surrendered confidential information
into the hands of an unknown entity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSocial engineering (which includes phishing) has been a consistent trend
in the last few years and remains one of the top threats in many different
countries,‚Äù said Mr Woo, adding that ‚Äúemail is, by large, the most popular
delivery vector globally.‚Äù</p>
<p>Individuals are therefore advised to read messages or emails carefully
before clicking on any links or downloads. Additionally, personal information
should never be divulged without first verifying the identity of the requester.</p>
<h4>3. Vulnerabilities in the cloud</h4>
<p>As individuals and organisations move towards data storage and processing
on the cloud, Mr Woo highlighted that the convenience of the cloud comes
with risks.</p>
<p>For example, cloud computing makes it inexpensive and simple for a company‚Äôs
personnel to provide additional services or software from the cloud service
provider without the approval of the company‚Äôs IT department. This could
inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities to the company‚Äôs IT systems. Mr
Woo also noted that incorrectly configured access controls are a major
cause of cloud breaches globally.</p>
<p>Another risk associated with the cloud is the fact that the hardware and
the infrastructure are under the control of the cloud provider. ‚ÄúAlthough
currently the service providers are doing quite well in enforcing security
and this does not seem to have resulted in any problems, compromise of
the cloud provider or of shared hardware could result in a breach,‚Äù Mr
Woo said.</p>
<p>Therefore, organisations migrating their processes to the cloud will need
to re-evaluate their cybersecurity landscape and put in place systems to
constantly monitor and log information about their cloud-based applications,
services, data and users.</p>
<h4>4. Dirty flash drives</h4>
<p>Data transfers within organisations still often occur via portable storage
media such as USB flash drives. These devices represent a weak link in
the cybersecurity chain, said Mr Woo.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt anything inherent about the USB itself that prevents malware
from being stored on it. So if you‚Äôre using a thumb drive and you plug
it into a machine connected to the internet, suspicious files can be transferred
onto it [and spread to another machine later],‚Äù Mr Woo explained.</p>
<p>He shared that within the Singapore government, detected and blocked malware
was mostly from external hard disk drives or flash drives. Aside from an
outright ban on the use of portable storage media, organisations can consider
issuing personnel with authorised storage devices, setting up secure channels
for file transfers, and educating individuals on file-sharing hygiene.</p>
<h4>5. Poor password practices</h4>
<p>Finally, Mr Woo highlighted that ‚Äúa very common thing that hackers like
to do is to take credentials exposed during previous data breaches and
try to reuse them.‚Äù This is known as credential stuffing and is particularly
dangerous when individuals use the same username and password combinations
for private and official accounts.</p>
<p>Protecting yourself from credential stuffing is simple‚Äîjust use a unique
password for each new account created. While it can be tedious to remember
multiple pairs of usernames and passwords, this problem can be solved easily
with reputable password manager software.</p>
<p>Mr Woo also emphasised the importance of changing passwords periodically.
Quoting tech geek Chris Pirillo, he said, ‚ÄúPasswords are like underwear:
you don‚Äôt let people see it, you should change it very often, and you shouldn‚Äôt
share it with strangers.‚Äù</p>
