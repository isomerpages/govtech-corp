<p>Amidst the oftentimes sombre news about the COVID-19 pandemic are encouraging
reports on how companies are using technology to overcome the unprecedented
disruptions they face. Cloud computing, data analytics and voice-over-IP
technologies are enabling companies to continue operations despite office
closures - conducting virtual business meetings, matching orders to delivery
slots in real-time, serving customers via interactive digital platforms
and keeping office workers in productive employment through telecommuting.
They clearly demonstrate the economic and human benefits of digitalisation
and are spurring others to accelerate the use of technology across their
organisations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, companies should resist the temptation to rush headlong
into acquiring the latest and shiniest pieces of technology. Hasty unplanned
technology acquisitions can turn into an unnecessary drain on a company’s
limited finances and management time. To avoid such costly quagmires, careful
staging of the technology procurement process is essential.</p>
<p>As a first step, it is important for the company to consider what solution
it truly needs for its own business requirements and to select the most
appropriate technology supplier accordingly. Can the identified requirements
be met by commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) products? COTS products
offer hardware and software solutions which are pre-packaged for relatively
fast deployment to meet the standard requirements of most enterprises.
If not, does the company require a blue-sky solution which integrates COTS
products with customised coding and bespoke system architectures? These
considerations help to filter the field of suitable technology suppliers
which the company can approach with an invitation to tender (ITT) or invitation
to quote (ITQ).</p>
<p>The task of preparing the company’s ITT or ITQ is foundational to the
technology procurement process. This should be done by a multi-stakeholder
team comprising procurement personnel as well as managers with in-depth
knowledge of the underlying business and operational needs. In crafting
the desired solution specifications, the team must be mindful not to over-specify
requirements as they could result in significant cost and delivery overruns.
For example, is it really necessary to require state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms for a chatbot intended to answer a finite range of
customer queries? Or can such a chatbot be more efficiently built and operated
with open source scripts like Python or JavaScript? And is the chatbot
so mission critical that it must be hosted on a battery of dedicated servers
with not less than 99.95% uptime? A disciplined methodical approach in
scrutinising technical requirements against actual business needs is paramount
if project costs and delays are to be contained.</p>
<p>In addition to right-sizing its technical requirements, the company should
aim to furnish as much information as feasible to potential suppliers.
The ITT or ITQ should contain details on its business objectives, conditions
of contract, implementation timeframe as well as procedure for suppliers
to seek clarifications. It is frequently helpful to conduct briefing sessions
to share the company’s expectations and to clarify any assumptions or issues
which potential suppliers may have. For example, does the company operate
any existing hardware or software which it intends to retain? If so, does
the new technology solution need to interface with such legacy systems?
These systems may be running on software written in old programming languages
like COBOL, which will require suppliers to source for project personnel
skilled in these arcane computer languages. Such clarifications and information
sharing will enable potential suppliers to craft their offers better to
meet the company’s requirements. This should also limit the risk of mismatched
expectations and reduce the likelihood of potential disputes between the
parties.</p>
<p>Following the issuance of its ITT or ITQ, the company can expect to receive
responses from interested suppliers. Their offers would contain details
of various proposed solutions, associated pricing structures, projected
delivery timelines and information on the suppliers’ personnel responsible
for implementing the solutions.</p>
<p>Aside from evaluating the financial costs and technical capabilities of
these proposed solutions, other areas that the company should review include
the licensing terms, change control, and resourcing mechanisms. The following
are some lines of enquiry that the company may consider pursuing. Does
the software licence limit the number of concurrent users within the company?
Would different licensing conditions and metrics apply if the software
is installed in a virtualised operating environment? What is the change
control process that affects possible project changes? How are the cost
and timeline implications for such change requests assessed? Has the supplier
resourced its proposal with an adequate number of skilled personnel? If
these personnel are subsequently redeployed, what is the mechanism for
ensuring their replacements have similar experience and skills?</p>
<p>A proper evaluation of the financial, legal, technical and project management
aspects of the offers will enable the company to make a well-informed decision
on the most suitable solution and supplier for its requirements. The company’s
selection of the right technology solution and supplier is a critical success
factor. As the technology project moves into the build and delivery stages,
significant levels of cooperation will be expected from both parties. Where
agile software development methodologies are employed, the supplier will
need regular feedback from the company’s business users throughout its
cycle of design, coding and testing activities. In turn, the company will
expect the supplier to fix any coding bugs or user-experience issues in
a timely fashion. These are fair expectations as the company and the supplier
need to work together to achieve the desired results. Having clear project
objectives and cultivating a strong relationship with effective team engagement
will provide a cooperative environment where the procured solution can
be implemented quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>A successful technology procurement will buttress the company’s ability
to ride out the storm and ensure its business is well-positioned to stay
ahead digitally when the crisis is over.</p>
