<p>Did you know that about one in 10 people aged 60 and above in Singapore
suffers from Alzheimer‚Äôs? This disease, which is the most common form of
dementia, affects memory function, thinking ability, and behaviour.</p>
<p>As Singapore‚Äôs population ages, the number of people living with dementia
will rise, with about 53,000 people already living with dementia here in
2020.</p>
<p>Fortunately, technology has been making a difference in care for Alzheimer‚Äôs
patients. With September being World Alzheimer‚Äôs Month, let‚Äôs take a look
at the various initiatives that are having an impact on this front.</p>
<h3>AI-driven digital drawing test to detect dementia</h3>
<p>There will be almost one million seniors in Singapore by 2030, and about
80,000 are projected to have dementia.</p>
<p>Current dementia tests are reactive and given only after complaints about
cognitive ability. They take 30 minutes to complete, depend on literacy
skills, and take trained staff to administer.</p>
<p>GovTech and SGH are conducting a research study on the viability of a
test that gets participants to draw on tablets. The test takes five minutes
to complete, and results are available immediately because drawings are
then scored by AI based on the drawings and the drawing stroke sequence.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs more, no special training is needed to administer the test, so
lay volunteers can be deployed. This enables dementia screening to be done
much more efficiently and scaled to be proactive.</p>
<p>If you are interested in taking part in the test or getting a family member
to try it out, you can sign up&nbsp;<a href="https://form.gov.sg/#!/627cc5dd2177ad00120a2bbb" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>

<h3>VR experience of dementia in Singapore</h3>
<p>One of the biggest struggles that people with dementia face is the lack
of understanding and empathy for those with the disease. After all, most
patients don‚Äôt bear any physical signs of the illness.</p>
<p>An online virtual reality&nbsp;<a href="https://dementia.org.sg/2022/03/30/experience-dementia-in-singapore/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">application</a>&nbsp;offers
users the chance to experience a day in the life of having dementia in
Singapore. You‚Äôll see the world through the eyes of Auntie Lucy ‚Äì who lives
with dementia ‚Äì and discover the anxieties and frustrations she faces at
home. Users will also learn about how the living environment and supportive
relationships can enable her to be independent.</p>
<p>For more practical tips on enhancing a HDB unit so that Alzheimer‚Äôs patients
can better function without help, check out this 360-degree&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudexpo.hiverlab.com/DFHome/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">design guide.</a>&nbsp;You
will be able to explore a typical HDB home and interact with various elements,
such as possible places to install grab bars, ramps, and other useful items.</p>
<p>These tools aim to educate not just family caregivers but also general
members of the public and imbue them with empathy and knowledge about Alzheimer‚Äôs.</p>
<h3>Smart home to ease daily life</h3>
<p>Smart home appliances within a smart home setup may be a luxury for most
of us, but they can really empower those living with dementia to lead independent
lives. Electric stoves, for instance, can have maximum temperatures set
for the burners so that the chances of accidents such as ignited cooking
oil are minimised.</p>
<p>Automatic lights that turn on when they detect movement can also be installed
so as to prevent falls when the home dweller is fumbling about in the dark
for the light switch.</p>
<p>These tools can also ease the work of caregivers. Smart home monitoring
such as sensors or cameras can send out alerts if there has been a prolonged
lack of movement so that caregivers can check in to see if the dementia
patient is doing fine.</p>
<p>A smart refrigerator will also enable caregivers to see what‚Äôs inside
through an app, making it more convenient to keep track of groceries needed
at home. The smart refrigerator can also display notes and reminders that
can be changed easily through the caregiver‚Äôs mobile device.</p>
<h3>Dementia detection through Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
<p>Early treatment of dementia has proven to make a significant difference
in the effectiveness of managing the disease.</p>
<p>So it‚Äôs great news that a few studies have shown promising results in
using artificial intelligence, or AI, to detect possible dementia.</p>
<p>Researchers at Boston University were able to develop an&nbsp;<a href="https://longevity.technology/news/could-new-ai-tool-diagnose-alzheimers-and-dementia-earlier/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AI model</a>&nbsp;that
used recordings of an individual‚Äôs speech to determine if he or she has
dementia.</p>
<p>The machine was first trained with audio recordings from over 1,000 people
with varying cognitive abilities. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
‚Äì the tech enables computers to handle human language and powers stuff
like Siri ‚Äì it gradually became able to not only tell the difference between
healthy individuals and those with dementia but also differentiate between
those with mild cognitive impairment and dementia.</p>
<p>Looking at the data, researchers concluded that when it comes to dementia
detection, the speed and fluency of speech were less important than the
content of what the test subjects were saying.</p>
<p>Such a model can increase the efficiency of screening and also has the
potential of becoming an online tool where people can easily upload speech
recordings for screening, vastly increasing the number of people getting
screened for dementia.</p>
<p>Another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unite.ai/study-shows-how-ai-can-predict-who-will-develop-dementia/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">large scale study</a>&nbsp;of
over 15,000 people in the US found that AI can predict with over 90 per
cent accuracy that people who attended memory clinics will develop dementia
within two years. Again, this finding can aid in the early detection of
Alzheimer‚Äôs and bring about faster, more effective intervention.</p>
<h3>A growing challenge for Singapore</h3>
<p>Life expectancy is rising in Singapore, and while that is good news, it
unfortunately also means that the number of people living with dementia
is expected to rise to 187,000 by 2050.</p>
<p>Various organisations are regularly rolling out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/community/symbols-of-traditional-items-used-to-help-people-with-dementia-navigate-chinatown-mrt-station" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">initiatives</a>&nbsp;to
mitigate this issue, and tech will no doubt play a growing role in helping
those with Alzheimer‚Äôs.</p>
<p>As the disease becomes more prevalent, it‚Äôs increasingly likely that we‚Äôll
personally know someone who has dementia or is a caregiver. Hopefully,
this article will provide you with useful information about this illness.</p>
