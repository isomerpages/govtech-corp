<h3>At the 4th GovTech STACK-X Meetup, two experts showcased some of the practical uses and latest advances in machine learning.</h3>
<p>In simpler times, the word ‚Äòtraining‚Äô applied exclusively to living things‚Äîfor
instance, you could train a dog to perform a trick or a person to excel
at a sport. But nowadays, even machines can be trained to carry out specific
tasks.</p>
<p>For something to be trainable, however, it must first be embedded with
some form of capacity for learning, and this is indeed what computer scientists
have enabled machines to do. This is the field of machine learning, an
exciting and rapidly expanding frontier.</p>
<p>Dr Tok Wee Hyong, Principal Data Science Manager at Microsoft, and Mr
Chong Jia Yi, a distinguished engineer at the Government Technology Agency
of Singapore (GovTech), gave audiences a flavour of the practical uses
of machine learning. They were speaking at the 4th GovTech STACK-X Meetup,
a regular series of talks to engage the tech community.</p>

<h3>Counting on AI</h3>
<p>‚ÄúToday, developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)
are happening at an accelerated pace, but what is really important is that
these are not just innovations in academia. A lot of the advancements are
immediately applicable to real-world problems,‚Äù said Dr Tok.</p>
<p>For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://natick.research.microsoft.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Project Natick</a>&nbsp;at
Microsoft seeks to understand the challenges of deploying subsea data centres
worldwide; it is the world‚Äôs first underwater data centre, and it was designed
with an emphasis on sustainability. Together with the Project Natick team,
Dr Tok and his team of data scientists used deep learning-based object
detection techniques to automate the monitoring and counting of marine
lifeforms and deeply understand the impact of deploying subsea data centres.</p>
<p>Dr Tok‚Äôs team also look at how they can solve some of the world‚Äôs toughest
challenges as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AI for Earth</a>&nbsp;program.
For example, the team worked on training segmentation models to perform
land cover mapping for the whole of the United States.</p>
<p>Today, a large segment of the world‚Äôs population lacks access to trained
radiologists, even when imaging equipment is readily available. His team
investigated various approaches to&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2018/03/07/using-microsoft-ai-to-build-a-lung-disease-prediction-model-using-chest-x-ray-images/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">using deep learning to predict diseases from chest X-ray images</a>,
providing additional inputs to radiologists and helping them make better
decisions. To aid interpretability of the results, his team used Class
Activation Maps (CAM) to understand and explain the prediction results
from the deep learning models,</p>
<h3>Painting a graphic picture</h3>
<p>Speaking of complex problems, creating lifelike simulations of objects
and living things, such as those portrayed in video games or animated movies,
used to be a manual and painstaking process. Now, with the help of machine
learning, animators can achieve their vision of realistic digital characters
with less hassle.</p>
<p>Mr Chong, a distinguished engineer at GovTech, knows very well the potential
of machine learning in graphics. Having worked with Pixar for close to
ten years prior to joining GovTech, he was responsible for developing physics
simulation and animation tools used in popular films such as WALL-E, Brave,
Toy Story 3 and Up.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor instance, I worked on a skin simulation for digital characters which
was used on all the animals of the movie Brave,‚Äù he said, adding that mimicking
how the skin slides across the body during movement is actually a pretty
complicated problem to solve mathematically.</p>
<p>He stated that in recent years, Machine Learning, in particular in the
field of Deep Learning, has enabled the generation of smooth dynamic motion
via trained Neural Networks. Essentially, we can now train machines to
figure out the algorithms/methods to animate or simulate dynamic characters.
Deep Learning methods for computer graphics and animation allow the automatic
generation of complex motions like fluids, skin/flesh/muscle and character
run cycles. This is now an additional tool that visual effects, animation
studios, and game companies use to improve the overall expressiveness of
their characters.</p>
<p>But the holy grail of machine learning for graphics, according to Mr Chong,
is ‚Äú2D RGB to 3D human pose estimation‚Äù. Basically, this means taking a
two-dimensional image (or video) of a person and then correctly identifying
and assigning the positions of the torso and limbs as if they were in three-dimensional
space. Existing machine learning algorithms still have difficulty performing
this task in a robust manner, but Mr Chong thinks that whoever can solve
this problem well ‚Äúwill change the face of the motion capture industry
as we know it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Clearly, the potential of machine learning is still largely untapped.
Novel and useful applications of the technology are still waiting to emerge,
limited only by our imagination.</p>
