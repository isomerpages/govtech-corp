<h3>1. Bak kwa scam</h3>
<p>Bak kwa is a must-have snack during the Lunar New Year season and it‚Äôs
common to see snaking queues to buy the sweet and salty BBQed meat. Many
stores are also sold out well before the arrival of the new year.</p>
<p>In 2021, scammers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20210204_police_advisory_beware_of_scam_involving_sale_of_hock_moon_hiong_bak_kwa" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">capitalised</a>&nbsp;on
the scarcity of bak kwa by posting Facebook advertisements that claimed
to sell ‚ÄúHock Moon Hiong‚Äù bak kwa in Singapore. They used the name of a
real bak kwa distributor in Malaysia to lend credence to the scam, though
the authentic retailer has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-warns-of-bak-kwa-scams-ahead-of-chinese-new-year" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">no physical outlets</a>&nbsp;in
Singapore.</p>
<p>Victims were required to place orders on the social media platform and
make full payment through PayNow or bank transfer. They realised they had
been cheated only after they did not receive their goods and were unable
to contact the seller.</p>
<p>Indeed, many goods such as abalone, are highly popular during the build-up
to the Lunar New Year, and the pressure to secure your share can lead you
to let your guard down.</p>
<p>Do your shopping early so you don‚Äôt have to resort to dubious sources
that may very well turn out to be scams. Remember, if something is priced
ridiculously low when everything else is soaring, it is most likely a scam.</p>
<h3>2. Parcel delivery scam</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs super convenient to buy all your Lunar New Year essentials online,
be it food items, new clothes, or home decorations. With so much stuff
bought through the internet, it‚Äôs hard to keep track of all the deliveries
you‚Äôre expecting. Plus, you‚Äôre probably anxious about your purchases arriving
in time for the new year.</p>
<p>These conditions just might make you fall for the parcel delivery phishing
scam, which scammers have used to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20231215_police_advisory_on_parcel_delivery_phishing_scams" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">steal</a>&nbsp;$560,000
from more than 360 victims in the first 11 months of 2023. In this scam,
victims receive a text message or email telling them that additional payment
or information is required to complete the delivery of their shopping.
The messages are designed to look like they are from logistics companies
such as SingPost and contain a phishing link. When victims click on the
link, they are brought to a spoofed website to key in their personal details
and banking credentials.</p>
<p>This information is then used by the scammers to make unauthorised transactions
through the victims‚Äô bank accounts or credit cards.</p>
<p>Be wary of links sent to you. It‚Äôs better not to click on them and go
to the official app or website yourself to verify the delivery status of
your purchases. Legitimate e-commerce portals will provide up-to-date information
on your deliveries.</p>
<h3>3. Angbao scam</h3>
<p>Angbaos will always be a part of the Lunar New Year, though with e-angbaos
rising in popularity, the physical angbao may one day become a thing of
the past.</p>
<p>But the technology has also made it possible for you to be tricked into
giving away angbaos to total strangers.</p>
<p>This is especially so as Lunar New Year greetings are likely to flood
your phone come midnight of the Lunar New Year. Scammers may use this opportunity
to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/imsavvy/Digital/ward-off-misfortunes-this-cny.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">impersonate friends and relatives</a>&nbsp;to
request for ane-hongbao.</p>
<p>So watch out for messages from unknown numbers and when in doubt, verify
the identity with a video call. While such a scam is not yet prevalent,
sending an e-angbao is instant and irreversible, so it pays to be careful.</p>
<h3>4. Fake promotion scam</h3>
<p>With many merchants riding on the Lunar New Year to offer discounts and
promotions, scammers will also crawl out of the woodwork to ride on the
expectation of such discounts and promotions.</p>
<p>In 2022, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/chinese-new-year-flyer-offering-fairprice-vouchers-not-created-or-endorsed-supermarket-1798886" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">flyer purportedly from NTUC FairPrice</a>&nbsp;was
distributed, offering vouchers for scanning a QR code that led to an online
financial survey. FairPrice later clarified on social media it was not
behind the flyer and made a police report.</p>
<p>Two years ago,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketing-interactive.com/geneco-embroiled-in-social-media-impersonation-scam-for-spoofed-cny-initiative" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">another scam</a>&nbsp;was
carried out by tapping on Geneco‚Äôs Lunar New Year giveaway. After the utilities
company announced it was giving away vouchers, scammers created a fake
Facebook page for Geneco and contacted victims to tell them they had won
the vouchers. The victims were asked to disclose their personal information
and given links to spoofed websites.</p>
<p>Both these cases show how easy it is for scammers to impersonate real
organisations and discount campaigns to phish for information from victims.
Always get information from the official websites and apps of retailers.
When referring to social media accounts, look for the verified check marks
for assurance that you are accessing the official accounts of merchants.</p>
<h3>5. Online travel scam</h3>
<p>While Lunar New Year usually means extended family gatherings, some people
use the break to travel overseas.</p>
<p>If a nice holiday is your idea of an ideal Lunar New Year, then be careful
of online travel booking scams.</p>
<p>With so many aspects of travel arrangements happening online, scammers
have many opportunities as well to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sc.com/sg/stories/how-to-protect-yourself-from-online-travel-booking-scams/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pull a fast one.</a>&nbsp;Fake
travel booking websites offering non-existent air tickets, hotel bookings,
and car rentals. Hotel room rates that look too good to be true. Bogus
e-visa sites. These are just some of the ways that your holiday can go
wrong before it even begins.</p>
<p>As always, take the extra time to verify that the portals you are on are
authentic. Don‚Äôt be taken in by offers of last-minute deals that are expiring.
These create a false sense of urgency and trigger the fear of missing out
so that you‚Äôll throw good sense out the window.</p>
<h3>Don‚Äôt let scammers huat</h3>
<p>Lunar New Year is about prosperity, but make sure you're hanging onto
your money. Don‚Äôt let it be the scammers who huat during this festive season.
Remember, here‚Äôs a summary of things you can do:</p>
<p>Be extremely cautious about sharing sensitive information, especially
your SingPass credentials. Remember, no legitimate service will ask for
your SingPass details via email, message, or phone call.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Download and use the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamshield.org.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield app</a>.
ScamShield filters out scam messages and calls from numbers used in scams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be wary of clicking on links, especially those received in unsolicited
messages or emails. Always verify the authenticity of the website; these
days, scammers can impersonate official websites closely. For government-related
services, look out for those starting with ‚Äò<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/dont-let-the-scammers-huat-this-lunar-new-year#1-bak-kwa-scam" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg</a>‚Äô
‚Äì these are legitimate URLs you can trust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last but not least, report Suspicious Activities: If you encounter or
suspect a scam, report it immediately to the authorities. This helps to
potentially stop the scam and alert others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here‚Äôs to a scam-free year of the dragon for everyone!</p>
