  Sound Blaster to Nets and ThumbDrive, these innovations shape our daily lives!

<h3>While the US and China are the countries usually associated with tech advancement, Singapore, too, has made crucial contributions to tech as we know it today. With National Day just over, let‚Äôs allow ourselves a moment of pride for three made-in-Singapore inventions, some of which might be used every day without even knowing!</h3>

<h3>The sound of music</h3>
<p>Up till the late 1980s, the personal computer was still an ‚Äúall-work-and-no-play‚Äù
machine geared towards business purposes. PC gaming was a niche pursuit
and audio from a computer sounded worse than the beeps and chirps from
R2D2.</p>
<p>Enter Creative Technology, a company founded in 1981 by Sim Wong Hoo fulfil
his dream of bringing high-quality audio to the world of computers. Within
six years, Creative developed a music synthesiser card that sold well in
Asia, its first hit product.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs prime-time debut would&nbsp;<a href="https://sg.creative.com/corporate/milestones?year=1986%20-%201990" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">come in 1989</a>,
when it launched the Sound Blaster at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas.
The Sound Blaster card could not only generate music but also reproduce
human voice and even came with a port for joysticks, a nod to the booming
gaming industry. Creative‚Äôs star turn in Las Vegas caught the eye ‚Äì or
rather, the ear ‚Äì of no less than the King of Pop, as recounted by Sim
in a&nbsp;<a href="https://custompc.raspberrypi.org/articles/the-sound-blaster-story" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2019 interview</a>:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMichael Jackson passed by and was attracted to the only booth that generated
computer audio throughout the entire Comdex show ‚Äì the CreativeBoothh.
I showed him the demo and presented our technology, and he stayed for 30
minutes, even though his minders wanted to usher him away after five minutes.
Obviously he was awed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sound Blaster was a runaway success, setting the standard for computer
audio and spawning a range of progressively sophisticated sound cards.
More than 400 million cards from the Sound Blaster family have been sold,
according to Sim.</p>
<p>Today, It‚Äôs ludicrous to think of a computer without audio, and the Sound
Blaster is the main reason for that. Whenever we use our computers to stream
TV shows on Netflix, listen to music on Spotify, and, of course, play a
vast variety of video games, know that we have a Singaporean tech pioneer
to thank for our daily entertainment.</p>
<h3>No cash? No problem</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Cashless payments in SG and its development, nets" src="/images/technews/SG_Tech_Represent_2.jpg">
</div>
<p><em>Cashless payments have existed in Singapore since 1985 with the introduction of Nets. PHOTO: <a href="https://sg.creative.com/corporate/milestones?year=1986%20-%201990" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UNSPALSH.com</a></em>
</p>
<p>Long before smartphones became ubiquitous (and indeed, an extension of
our hands), Singapore was already making its first step towards a cashless
society. Electronic funds transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS) technology
originated in the US in early 1980s, but Singapore was one of the very
first in the world when it introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/9ea5aea3-d8ab-459c-9fcb-89b19a1ba53e#3" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nets</a>,
or Network for Electronic Transfers.</p>
<p>Trials started in 1985 as a pilot project to enable people to pay for
their purchases using ATM cards instead of cash ‚Äì one of the very first
in Asia and the world!</p>
<p>Following the successful trial, Nets was launched island-wide in 1986
with retailers such as departmental stores, supermarkets, and petrol stations
coming onboard. Spending through Nets hit more than $1 billion by 1993.</p>
<p>Nets, which was established by Singapore‚Äôs leading local banks, would
go on to introduce other services.</p>
<p>For instance, the humble CashCard ‚Äì the world‚Äôs very first electronic
legal tender or cash wallet ‚Äì was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nets.com.sg/about/milestones/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">rolled out in 1996</a>&nbsp;and
became the only payment mode for the country‚Äôs road toll system. It was
the mobile wallet before mobile wallets were actually a thing!</p>
<p>Nets also runs the PayNow peer-to-peer funds transfer service, which allows
users to send and receive money instantly using their mobile or identification
numbers. More than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nets.com.sg/nets-stories/is-singapore-ready-to-go-cashless" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">$370 million</a>&nbsp;was
transferred using PayNow within a year of its launch.</p>
<h3>The Rule of ThumbDrive</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, the only way to transfer large files was to burn data
onto CD-ROM. Let‚Äôs not even talk about the 1.44MB floppy disk. Yes, 1.44
megabytes. You read that right, it's not even enough to store one MP3 song.</p>
<p>That changed at the turn of the century when Trek 2000 International launched
the&nbsp;<a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1071_2010-03-23.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ThumbDrive</a>,
which was so named because it was a thumb-sized data storage device. But
it wasn‚Äôt just the size that made it such a game-changer. It offered plug-and-play
convenience (simply sticking it into a computer‚Äôs USB port, no installation
required), and users could read, create, and drag-and-drop files just as
they would on any computer hard disk. You no longer needed to burn a CD
just to share the digital photos from a family vacation.</p>
<p>An added bonus was its robustness. Relying on Flash memory and operating
without any moving parts, ThumbDrives could survive the occasional drops
far better than other forms of storage.</p>
<p>As prices dropped and storage capacities grew, ThumbDrives quickly became
the default choice to move files between computers. It is perhaps fitting
that this diminutive piece of tech with an outsized impact should come
from our Little Red Dot.</p>
<h3>Innovation ‚Äì a never-ending quest</h3>
<p>In the world of technology, nothing and no one stays cutting edge forever.
Creative entered the war of the portable digital music players in the 2000s
and was eventually surpassed when Apple‚Äôs iPods cornered the market. China
now leads the world in e-payment adoption. And cloud storage services mean
that ThumbDrives are no longer as essential as they were just a couple
of years ago.</p>
<p>But if one can get knocked off one‚Äôs perch, one can surely climb back
on.</p>
<p>Creative Technologies is still trying to define the next wave of digital
audio tech. Last year, it earned rave reviews with the&nbsp;<a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/creative-technology-returns-relevance-sim-wong-hoos-super-x-fi-034800842.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Super X-Fi system</a>,
which aims to make headphones sound better than multi-speaker surround
systems.</p>
<p>Singapore is also making a renewed push on the cashless front, with multiple
companies and systems competing to be the default choice of consumers.</p>
<p>Well, no one knows what the future will bring, but if history has shown
us, one should never write of Singaporeans and their ability to innovate.
This national month of independence, let‚Äôs continue flying the flag high
with tech achievements from our sunny island‚Äô</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
