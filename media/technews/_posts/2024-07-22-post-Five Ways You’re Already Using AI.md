<p>When Google announced in May this year that it was infusing artificial
intelligence into its search engine to generate AI-powered summaries, it
took just a week for embarrassing errors ‚Äî such as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recommending glue</a> as
part of a pizza recipe ‚Äî to cause a furore online. Less than a month later,
the product was quietly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-overviews-rollback.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">scaled back</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI Overviews, as the new feature is known, would have represented one
of the most prominent ways AI is entering our daily lives. Not for nothing
is ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù a common verb now and to see AI-generated text every time we
look for information would have been pretty in-your-face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even with this setback, AI has already inexorably been infused into
many of our interactions with technology. Here are some ways that you are,
perhaps unknowingly, using AI in your everyday habits.&nbsp;</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Search (on non-Google platforms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predictive text in email</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Translation services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic categorisation of your smart device‚Äôs photos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations determined by algorithms</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Search (on non-Google platforms)</h3>
<p>In some ways, Google was trying to play catch up with AI Overviews, as
other platforms have already incorporated AI into their search engines,
including the public sector‚Äôs whole-of-government search tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, Microsoft <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/microsoft-ai-chatgpt-bing.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">added AI to Bing</a> way
back in February 2023, just two months after ChatGPT was released. This
product was later relaunched as Copilot, a search engine that works like
a chatbot, replying with fully formed sentences that are annotated with
web links.</p>
<p>Even the search bar in Meta‚Äôs apps (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and
Messenger) now work with Meta AI. One usually associates search in WhatsApp
with trawling through your texting history, but now you can type questions
like ‚Äúwhat to do in London‚Äù, and Meta AI will generate a response in a
chat thread.</p>
<p>As for the Government, public sector websites can now integrate GovTech's
<a href="https://www.search.gov.sg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SearchSG</a>, a search engine powered by machine learning that enhances
citizens' search experience and discoverability of government information
and services. For example, the tool has a <strong>SmartFinder</strong> function,
a smart widget that replaces the conventional "Control + F" page search,
displaying interactive AI-generated page summaries, FAQs and cross-agency
recommendations along with page search results.</p>
<p>Citizens will also have a bird's eye view of important information via
the <strong>SmartSnippet</strong>, which auto extracts snippets from the
most relevant documents and FAQs on the results page.</p>
<p>To reduce the need for citizens to sift through numerous web results,
SearchSG also has a Large Language Modelling-backed <strong>SmartAnswer</strong> feature
that is able to provide concise and customised responses to search queries,
supported with citations to ensure credibility and accuracy.</p>
<p>It is not just large and established organisations that are revolutionising
search. Search engines that are based <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/technology/perplexity-search-ai-google.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">entirely on AI</a> have
also sprouted, again offering the user experience of search results in
the form of annotated paragraphs. While Google remains the most dominant
search platform by far, its AI Overviews push can be seen as an acknowledgement
that AI-powered search is likelier than not to become a big thing in our
lives.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Predictive text in email</h3>
<p>Emails are an inescapable part of work and personal life, and if you use
Gmail, chances are you‚Äôve seen suggested words and phrases pop up in grey
in front of your cursor. Just as you‚Äôve typed ‚ÄúI hope this email‚Äù, ‚Äúfinds
you well‚Äù appears as suggestions and all you have to do is hit ‚Äútab‚Äù to
use those words.</p>
<p>Google's <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9116836?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Compose</a> function
is powered by machine learning, a technique that enables computers to learn
through examples in an automated manner. It‚Äôs also what powers AI as we
know it today.</p>
<p>Google's Smart Compose has been around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/personaltech/gmail-smart-compose.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">since 2018</a>,
way before AI became such a buzzword. In other words, many of us had already
been using AI before AI became a thing.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Translation services</h3>
<p>Remember the time when Google Translate suddenly became uncannily polished?
Before 2016, outputs from the service were characterised by awkward phrasing,
garbled grammar, and literal word-for-word translations that were dead
giveaways of a machine‚Äôs work.</p>
<p>Then, seemingly overnight, Google Translate became capable of translating
long passages that were not just error-free (or close) but also with a
nimbleness in capturing nuances of the original writing.</p>
<p>What <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a>?
Machine learning had been introduced into Google Translate, taking over
from rules-based programming. So instead of coding a condition that ‚Äúraining
cats and dogs‚Äù refers to heavy rain and not animals falling from the sky,
the computer was simply left to figure it out after being fed thousands
of examples of how ‚Äúraining cats and dogs‚Äù was used in different pieces
of writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Translation services are also embedded in social media nowadays. See a
comment or photo caption in a language other than English? There‚Äôs usually
a ‚Äútranslate‚Äù button you can tap to instantly see the English equivalent.</p>
<p>This form of machine learning, known as natural language processing, is
also what is behind Google's Smart Compose and ChatGPT. Such tools have
proved useful for a myriad of professions and the Government also launched
its own chatbot called <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/productivity-tools/pair/features" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pair Chat</a>,
a secure version of ChatGPT for government officers. Pair has the added
advantage of being built specifically to understand the context of Singapore‚Äôs
Government and provide even more useful responses based on its specialised
knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Automatic categorisation of your smart device‚Äôs photos</h3>
<p>Open the app where your photos and videos are stored on your smart device.
Chances are, you‚Äôll find your photos already automatically categorised
into groups such as art, food, and mountains. For those of you with kids,
baby is another category that‚Äôs sure to pop up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, of course, the people in your images are also automatically identified
and grouped together so that you can easily find photos of yourself, your
spouse, or any particular person who appears enough in your snapshots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such convenience is made possible by computer vision, a form of machine
learning that enables computers to identify elements in images and videos.
Computer vision is also what drives self-driving cars by enabling them
to ‚Äúsee‚Äù road conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Recommendations determined by algorithms</h3>
<p>Whenever you load your favourite streaming service, you see a bunch of
programmes that somehow fit your taste for rom-coms and police procedurals.
Open your preferred e-commerce site, and the latest video game console,
along with all the must-have accessories, are already awaiting you on the
home screen.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you‚Äôre looking for your next career move? Over at the <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture</a> job
portal, jobs that match your experience and professional profile continually
surface while you browse the different positions available.</p>
<p>These recommendations are made possible by algorithms that take in factors
like your past views and purchases, browsing history, and other forms of
digital trails you‚Äôve left behind. The algorithms ‚Äì yes, once again, they
fall under machine learning ‚Äì then find products that are similar to what
you like for recommendation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because these suggestions are constantly changing according to your behaviour,
the system is ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù and able to mould itself to your shifting preferences.</p>
<p>In the case of My Careers Future, its recommendation system is powered
by 10 different AI models to improve job matching.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>AI is already in your life</h3>
<p>As you can see, AI is no longer something that you have to actively seek
out to use. Instead, it‚Äôs already deeply embedded into pieces of technology
that you are likely to use every day. GovTech is also proactively leading
efforts to use AI to improve government digital services and improve the
lives of all who live here.</p>
<p>With Elon Musk‚Äôs AI startup <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-27/musk-s-xai-raises-6-billion-in-sequioa-backed-series-b-funding?embedded-checkout=true" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">raising $6 billion last month</a>,
the AI race is only getting hotter. While no one can say for sure what
the next AI products will look like, it‚Äôs safe to say that AI‚Äôs impact
on our lives, in ways big and small, will get larger.</p>
