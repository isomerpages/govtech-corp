<p>Five years ago, GovTech was tasked to provide infrastructure and support
for the country‚Äôs Smart Nation initiative. With how the agency has grown
and developed over the years, we wanted to have a look at where GovTech
has come from and how far it has come. We spoke to 5 members of the GovTech
team who have been around since the beginning.</p>

</p>
<h3>Q: Can you share your proudest moment/ achievement here at GovTech?</h3>
<p>Eugene Wong, Senior DevOps Engineer: ‚ÄúMy proudest achievements were when
I led the project management of our first-ever centrally managed IT security
audit (AIISA), which involved auditing and improving the IT security of
over 100 agencies, as well as when I played a key role in a major migration
within our GDS (Government Digital Services), which took a year to prepare.</p>
<p>Candice Wee, Deputy Director of People Operations and Systems shared on
her time spent: ‚ÄúBeing a part of the team that successfully implemented
the Workday HR system was extremely fulfilling! The project was important
not only because it demonstrated that GovTech could ‚Äúwalk the talk‚Äù when
it came to adopting a Cloud-First strategy, but that it was also instrumental
in Public Service Transformation, by allowing us to have a holistic view
of the HR practices and processes across Government, improving and standardising
them for greater efficiency, stronger governance, and improved user experience
and engagement.‚Äù</p>
<p>Shubhashini Palanisamy, Senior Manager said: ‚ÄúIt feels great to be a part
of this organisation and to be able to see the impact GovTech has. I feel
proudest just by contributing to ensure that the necessary policy and governance
is in place, and I look forward to how GovTech can continue to harness
the power of technology to improve the lives of Singaporeans!‚Äù</p>
<h3>Q: From your perspective, how has GovTech changed or grown over the last 5 years?</h3>
<p>Dawn Ang, Executive Application Infrastructure Manager, recalled her experience
with GovTech over the past five years: ‚ÄúGovTech has accelerated the adoption
of digitalisation, and placed stronger emphasis on Cloud adoption and the
importance of cyber security and awareness. As an employer, GovTech has
also becoming much more employee-centric, choosing to focus on building
staff competency and values!‚Äù</p>
<p>Chew Wei Zhang, Infrastructure Engineer echoes Dawn‚Äôs views that the organisation
has a stronger focus on building in-house capabilities, ‚ÄúThroughout the
years, I have witnessed the transformation from a focus on project management
to more engineering and technical competencies. We have also truly embraced
our values of Agile, Bold and Collaborative - where everyone is comfortable
with contributing to ideas and willing to adapt to new technologies.‚Äù</p>
<p>Candice adds, ‚ÄúGovTechies have been collaborating across teams more than
ever, and the pace at which we work has accelerated, fueled by our conviction
to fulfil this role that we have been entrusted, especially in the past
year or so supporting the Government‚Äôs response to COVID-19.‚Äù Identifying
the case type</p>
<h3>Q: How do you feel about being able to witness these changes?</h3>
<p>Candice further shared, ‚ÄúI feel humbled and gratified to have been able
to work with capable, and passionate individuals who continue to push themselves
hard every day for our belief that the work we do is for a bigger and greater
purpose ‚Äì to make a difference to the nation and the lives of Singaporeans.‚Äù</p>
<p>Eugene enthusiastically remarked that, ‚ÄúIt feels like we have entered
the Golden Age of innovation in GovTech right now, where we are coming
up with digital-first solutions and leading the change across the public
sector, as well as collaborating with the industry.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Q: Would you like to share a birthday message for GovTech/ fellow GovTechies as we turn 5 in October?</h3>
<p>Chew Wei Zhang: ‚ÄúI am thankful for the opportunities I‚Äôve been given as
they have allowed me to grow and improve myself to be an asset to my division
and to GovTech. I would like to say to GovTech Happy 5th Birthday and many
more years to come!‚Äù</p>
<p>Dawn added, ‚ÄúTo my fellow GovTechies, it has been a challenging but nourishing
journey for all of us. Looking forward to many more years of progress,
and let‚Äôs succeed together in GovTech!‚Äù</p>
<p>To GovTech and all GovTechies, it has not been easy, but continue to keep
up the good work. Stay Safe and Stay Strong and, we‚Äôll see you all next
year for number 6.</p>
