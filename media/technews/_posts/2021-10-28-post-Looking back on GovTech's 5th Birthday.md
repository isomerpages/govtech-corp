## Q: Can you share your proudest moment/ achievement here at GovTech? 

Eugene Wong, Senior DevOps Engineer: “My proudest achievements were when I led the project management of our first-ever centrally managed IT security audit (AIISA), which involved auditing and improving the IT security  of over 100 agencies, as well as when I played a key role in a major migration within our GDS (Government Digital Services), which took a year to prepare.

Candice Wee, Deputy Director of People Operations and Systems shared on her time spent: “Being a part of the team that successfully implemented the Workday HR system was extremely fulfilling! The project was important not only because it demonstrated that GovTech could “walk the talk” when it came to adopting a Cloud-First strategy, but that it was also instrumental in Public Service Transformation, by allowing us to have a holistic view of the HR practices and processes across Government, improving and standardising them for greater efficiency, stronger governance, and improved user experience and engagement.”

Shubhashini Palanisamy, Senior Manager said: “It feels great to be a part of this organisation and to be able to see the impact GovTech has. I feel proudest just by contributing to ensure that the necessary policy and governance is in place, and I look forward to how GovTech can continue to harness the power of technology to improve the lives of Singaporeans!”



## Q: From your perspective, how has GovTech changed or grown over the last 5 years?

Dawn Ang, Executive Application Infrastructure Manager, recalled her experience with GovTech over the past five years: “GovTech has accelerated the adoption of digitalisation, and placed stronger emphasis on Cloud adoption and the importance of cyber security and awareness. As an employer, GovTech has also becoming much more employee-centric, choosing to focus on building staff competency and values!”

Chew Wei Zhang, Infrastructure Engineer echoes Dawn’s views that the organisation has a stronger focus on building in-house capabilities, “Throughout the years, I have witnessed the transformation from a focus on project management to more engineering and technical competencies. We have also truly embraced our values of Agile, Bold and Collaborative - where everyone is comfortable with contributing to ideas and willing to adapt to new technologies.”

Candice adds, “GovTechies have been collaborating across teams more than ever, and the pace at which we work has accelerated, fueled by our conviction to fulfill this role that we have been entrusted, especially in the past year or so supporting the Government’s response to COVID-19.”

## Q: How do you feel about being able to witness these changes?

Candice further shared, “I feel humbled and gratified to have been able to work with capable, and passionate individuals who continue to push themselves hard every day for our belief that the work we do is for a bigger and greater purpose – to make a difference to the nation and the lives of Singaporeans.”

Eugene enthusiastically remarked that, “It feels like we have entered the Golden Age of innovation in GovTech right now, where we are coming up with digital-first solutions and leading the change across the public sector, as well as collaborating with the industry.”

## Q: Would you like to share a birthday message for GovTech/ fellow GovTechies as we turn 5 in October?

Chew Wei Zhang: “I am thankful for the opportunities I’ve been given as they have allowed me to grow and improve myself to be an asset to my division and to GovTech. I would like to say to GovTech Happy 5th Birthday and many more years to come!”

Dawn added, “To my fellow GovTechies, it has been a challenging but nourishing journey for all of us. Looking forward to many more years of progress, and let’s succeed together in GovTech!” 

To GovTech and all GovTechies, it has not been easy, but continue to keep up the good work. Stay Safe and Stay Strong and, we’ll see you all next year for number 6.
