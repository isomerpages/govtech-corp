</p>
<p>The accelerating adoption and deployment of technologies like cloud computing,
data analytics and machine learning are rapidly transforming the finance
industry. Financial technology (fintech) is generating numerous opportunities
for young tech startups and established industry stalwarts to offer innovative
services in various areas, such as retail investment, general insurance,
digital payments and fund transfers.</p>
<p>As an international finance hub, Singapore continues to be among the top
three destinations for fintech investments within the Asia-Pacific. It
was recently reported that fintech investments in Singapore crossed S$1
billion during the first nine months of 2019 – a 69% increase from the
same period in 2018.</p>
<p>With over 600 startups operating here, Singapore’s expanding fintech sector
is also expected to create an additional 1000 jobs per year. However, such
hyper-growth coupled with the increasing sophistication of the underlying
transactions, and the number and diversity of parties involved, also increases
the possibility for disputes to arise.</p>
<p>Some possible areas for fintech disputes include data usage, intellectual
property (IP) ownership, technology licensing, self-executing or smart
contracts. Parties to such disputes may be based in multiple jurisdictions
and may include financial institutions like banks, credit card issuers,
insurance companies as well as technology service operators such as digital
platform and software providers.</p>
<p>The subject matter involved in fintech disputes may often be specific,
which makes legal and technical expertise essential for resolving such
disputes. The issues in fintech disputes also tend to involve commercially
valuable information and trade secrets.</p>
<p>In addition, given the relatively compressed lifecycles of fintech products,
avoiding costly and lengthy public litigation is of prime interest for
disputing parties. These considerations are leading many fintech investors
towards a strategy of using alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms
as a means of resolving disputes and safeguarding the value of their business
relationships as well as financial investments.</p>
<h3>Advantages of mediation and arbitration</h3>
<p>Mediation and arbitration are the two principal forms of ADR. Mediation
is an informal process where parties request the mediator to assist them
in settling their dispute. The mediator facilitates the settlement process
by helping the parties identify their interests, narrow the issues, and
work towards a negotiated agreement to resolve the dispute. In contrast
to mediation, arbitration is a more formal process where parties submit
their dispute to one or more arbitrators who would render an arbitral award
final and binding on the parties.</p>
<p>Mediation and arbitration have certain features which, if well managed,
can result in significant cost and time savings, making them a more affordable
and accessible avenue for resolving fintech disputes. These advantages
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Single procedure: mediation and arbitration allow parties to resolve in
a single forum, thereby avoiding the expense and complexity of multi-jurisdictional
litigation, as well as the risk of inconsistent results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Party autonomy: unlike court-based litigation, the private nature of mediation
and arbitration allows parties to exercise greater control over the dispute
resolution process and outcome. Parties can select the most suitable mediator
or arbitrator, as well as the place and language of the proceedings, to
resolve their disputes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time and cost: mediation and arbitration allow parties to save significant
costs that the parties would otherwise incur in multi-jurisdictional court
proceedings. Mediation and arbitration also provide for shorter timelines
which parties can further adapt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expertise: in mediation and arbitration, parties can select their mediator
or arbitrator and thus can choose a mediator or arbitrator with expertise
and familiarity with the relevant legal, technical or business area, including
fintech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidentiality: except where otherwise required by law, mediation and
arbitration are confidential, allowing parties to keep the proceedings
and any results confidential. Confidential dispute resolution may help
parties to focus on the merits of their dispute without fear of adverse
publicity. This is particularly relevant where commercial reputations and
sensitive information or trade secrets are involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preserving business relationships: where procedures such as mediation
are used, parties are assisted in balancing their interests in pursuing
the dispute against the value of preserving their commercial relationship.
For example, 70% of the mediations administered by the WIPO Arbitration
and Mediation Center (WIPO Center) have resulted in settlement by the parties.
Even in arbitration, some 40% of WIPO cases are settled by the parties
before any formal decision is issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforceability: in arbitration, arbitral awards are binding upon the parties
and enforceable internationally as a consequence of the New York Convention
(United Nations Convention for the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards of 1958), which provides for the recognition of arbitral
awards on par with domestic court judgments and facilitates the enforcement
of awards across borders in signatory states. In mediation, the Singapore
Mediation Convention (aka. United Nations Convention on International Settlement
Agreements Resulting from Mediation adopted by the UN in December 2018
and opened in Singapore for signature by member nations in August 2019)
similarly provides for the cross-border enforcement of mediated settlement
agreements amongst signatory states.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Singapore Mediation Convention continues to boost Singapore’s reputation
as a trusted international hub for commercial dispute resolution. ADR in
Singapore is strongly supported by various global and reputable dispute
resolution institutions such as the WIPO Center, which has had a regional
office in Singapore since 2010. With an international panel of mediators
and arbitrators with expertise in IP and technology, including fintech,
the WIPO Center’s mediation and arbitration rules also address specific
needs in these disputes, such as provisions on confidentiality and technical
evidence. In recent years, the WIPO Center has handled a number of fintech
disputes and one such dispute which was successfully resolved is described
below.</p>
<p><em>A Banking Software Dispute</em>
</p>
<p>A bank and a technology company concluded an agreement on the provision
of data processing services. It was agreed that the technology company
was to be the exclusive provider for the bank’s affiliates in certain countries.
The agreement provided that any dispute would be resolved under the WIPO
Expedited Arbitration Rules and that the sole arbitrator would be selected
from a panel of persons with IT experience.</p>
<p>A few years after the conclusion of their agreement, the technology company
alleged that the bank had violated the agreement by using data processing
services offered by other third parties in the countries covered by the
agreement. When the parties failed to settle the dispute amongst themselves,
WIPO expedited arbitration proceedings were commenced.</p>
<p>Following the filing of the request for arbitration, the parties selected
an arbitrator with expertise in IT and data processing services from a
list of candidates proposed by the WIPO Center. The sole arbitrator held
a private two-day hearing and rendered a final award just three months
after the request for arbitration was filed.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fintech is transforming every segment of the finance industry and bringing
new product innovations to consumers. Aside from investing effort, time,
and resources in growing their business models, fintech investors and operators
would be well advised to consider having appropriate dispute resolution
strategies in place to manage and resolve disputes that may readily arise
from their complex activities effectively. With its distinctive features,
ADR provides the means for the effective resolution of fintech disputes.</p>
