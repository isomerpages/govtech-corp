<p>It all comes down to simple economics: when the demand for talent is high
and supply is low, people with the right skills can command top dollar.</p>
<p>In fact, according to survey results published by employment website Glassdoor,
the shortage of tech talent is so dire that even an intern at Facebook
can command US$8,000 per month.</p>
<p>For countries seeking to transform the way the government provides services,
the need for tech talent is felt even more acutely.</p>
<p>Not only does the government need to compete with the high starting salaries
offered by sexy startups, it also needs to shed its image as rule-bound
and slow to move.</p>
<p>The talent issue was a major concern at the second Digital Government
Exchange (DGX), a two-day closed-door dialogue between government Chief
Information Officers (CIOs) and public sector leaders around the world.</p>
<p>Held from 2-4 May 2017 at Singapore’s Asian Civilisations Museum, DGX
2017 was organized by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO)
and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech).</p>
<p>Head of Singapore's Civil Service, Mr Peter Ong, delivered the opening
address at DGX 2017. He also announced the launch of the API exchange (APEX),
a centralised data sharing platform for government agencies developed by
GovTech and the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</p>
<p>Mr Ong said: "A network of data “pipes and gates”, APEX lets agencies
share data through secure application programming interfaces or APIs, while
centrally monitoring and managing the security of these exchanges."</p>
<h3>Buy, rent, or grow</h3>
<p>Speakers on the first day of DGX shared their thoughts on getting the
right talent to create and deliver digital government services.</p>
<p>Drawing from his experience as the Chief Technology Officer of the United
Kingdom from 2012 to 2016, Mr Liam Maxwell said that governments have three
main options when it comes to acquiring tech talent: buy, rent or grow.</p>
<p>Governments can ‘buy’ talent by hiring skilled professionals from industry.
In other cases, they could ‘rent’ expertise by bringing in IT contractors.
But for true transformation from within, the UK government has opted to
‘grow’ a percentage of its tech talent by training existing staff.</p>
<p>“In an organisation of 280,000, we’ve got about 30,000 civil servants
working on digital and data preparedness projects. Of those, 39 percent
are long-term civil servants who’ve elected to take part in the process
of digital transformation,” said Mr Maxwell, who was appointed the UK’s
first National Technology Advisor in 2016.</p>
<p>Potential future leaders of the civil service are sent on deep immersion
courses at places like Silicon Valley to give them an understanding of
the possibilities that technology enables, Mr Maxwell said.</p>
<p>Frontline staff, in the meantime, train to improve their service capabilities
at academies run by the UK’s Government Digital Services.</p>
<h3>Not for forever</h3>
<p>More importantly, Mr Maxwell noted, the government needed to change its
mindset that a civil service job was for life. While the strategy in the
past may have been for every staff to stay on in the government with the
eventual goal of becoming the CIO, this approach simply does not work for
today’s tech talent.</p>
<p>“That way of thinking was the most off-putting thing for people we wanted
to recruit, because people want to work in a dynamic environment, where
being in the government is just part of their journey,” Mr Maxwell said.</p>
<p>“We found that the pay had to be reasonable, but we didn’t have to pay
top dollar. What was important was making sure that we accommodated people
and that they felt valued,” he said. “But the most important thing was
to give them a sense of mission — people join us because they want to make
a difference.”</p>
<p>Agreeing, Mr Lars Frelle-Petersen, Director General at the Danish Agency
for Digitisation, added that their recruitment strategy has been to assure
candidates that a job with the government is not necessarily for life,
but good for their careers in the short term.</p>
<p>For example, the scale of government projects can be an attractive reason
to join, he said.</p>
<p>“If they want to play with big toys they should come to the public sector,
because that’s where the biggest toys are. What we do is try to sell the
larger projects like our digital signature project, which is the biggest
IT project in Denmark at the moment,” said Mr Frelle-Petersen.</p>
<h3>Multiple paths to success</h3>
<p>Unlike the UK, however, Denmark has opted to tap into the capabilities
of the private sector rather than focus on developing tech talent in-house.</p>
<p>“We felt that we should not be building tech competencies ourselves but
forming partnerships with the private sector,” said Mr Frelle-Petersen.
“Other kinds of businesses like ICT companies and banks face similar tasks
and similar problems.”</p>
<p>“It’s interesting how both the UK and Denmark have managed to achieve
good government digitisation outcomes despite your differing approaches
to the same problems,” said Ms Jacqueline Poh, Chief Executive of GovTech.</p>
<p>Singapore has taken yet another path, she said, by offering Singaporeans
working in Silicon Valley a chance to use their skills to serve the country
under the Smart Nation Fellowship.</p>
<p>Apart from plans to train 10,000 civil servants in digital capabilities
over the next four years, the Smart Nation Fellowship is a scheme that
allows top data scientists, technologists and engineers from academia and
industry in Singapore and overseas to contribute to Singapore over a period
of three to six months — without having to join the government full-time.</p>
<p>When we launched the programme a year or so ago, we received over 280
applications over a three month period.” she shared. "It’s been a great
programme to give the Fellows a good flavour of working on technology solutions
for the public, and hopefully inspire them to return to Singapore to contribute
in their own way.”</p>
