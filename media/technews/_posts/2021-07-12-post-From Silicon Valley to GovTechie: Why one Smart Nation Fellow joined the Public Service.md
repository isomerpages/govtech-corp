<p>Tech is usually thought of as gizmos, gadgets, machines, and computers.
But really, it is the human talent that makes the biggest difference and
gives tech its focus on making our lives better.</p>

<p>GovTech recognises the vast pool of tech talent in the private sector,
which is why the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/careers/smart-nation-fellowship-programme/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation Fellowship Programme</a>&nbsp;was
introduced in 2016, seeking to attract established data scientists, engineers,
software developers, technologists, designers and applied researchers to
take three to six months - or on a part-time basis - to collaborate with
us to co-create digital or engineering solutions that will make an impact
on people‚Äôs lives.</p>
<p>One such Smart Nation Fellow, polyglot software engineer Wang Zhen, joined
the programme in Oct 2020. With more than a decade of experience in the
US tech scene (at Google, a startup, and a venture capitalist firm), GovTech
appointed him to work on improving the internal tech infrastructure in
the public sector.</p>
<p>Six months later, Wang Zhen decided that GovTech was more than a stint
to him and accepted the position of Distinguished Engineer to continue
his career in the public sector. We caught up with him to find out more
about what he‚Äôs up to in GovTech and why he decided to extend his commitment
to the organisation.</p>
<h3>How did you end up joining the Smart Nation Fellowship? Was there any hesitation in moving from the private sector to the public sector?</h3>
<p>My wife had to relocate to Singapore last year, so naturally, I started
looking for opportunities here. And then, on an ex-Googler mailing list,
I came across a call for help on several GovTech projects. I reached out
and learned about the Smart Nation Fellowship Programme.</p>
<p>I was in Singapore more than a decade ago and was running a software business.
The smooth process of obtaining the necessary applications to work here
left me with a positive impression of Singapore government services, providing
the nudge to join GovTech years later. And since the fellowship was a short-term
commitment, it was easy to say yes.</p>
<h3>Can you highlight some areas of your work now?</h3>
<p>I‚Äôm currently designing systems around GovTech‚Äôs API strategy to facilitate
data sharing between government agencies and the private sector.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also advising on new digital products‚Äô architectures and talent acquisition
programmes.</p>
<h3>What is the biggest difference between working in the private sector and public sector?</h3>
<p>Return on investment and results are easily quantifiable in the private
sector; it‚Äôs a more nuanced topic in the public sector because the government
is not a revenue-driven entity. We need to use other measures like time-to-market,
satisfaction level surveys, and user engagement to gauge performance.</p>
<h3>How does working in Singapore compare with other countries that you've worked in?</h3>
<p>The Silicon Valley tech scene is all about ‚Äúmoving fast and breaking things‚Äù
and failure is pretty destigmatised. My sense so far is that Singapore‚Äôs
workplace culture seems more risk-averse, which is, of course, not a bad
thing per se.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs notable that a&nbsp;<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ASEAN_Youth_Survey_2019_Report.pdf" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2019</a>&nbsp;survey
of ASEAN youth by the World Economic Forum found that Singaporean youth
recorded the lowest desire to become an entrepreneur among ASEAN peers,
even though Singapore is super business-friendly (low corporate tax, first-class
infrastructure, mature legal system, government funding etc.).</p>
<p>If I were pushed for an explanation for Singaporeans‚Äô risk-aversion that
the WEF report didn‚Äôt offer, I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs a rational choice in a wealthy
society with a stable (but not booming) economy -- when it‚Äôs easy to attain
a comfortable life, it becomes hard to risk losing the status quo and falling
behind peers. The ‚Äòkiasu‚Äô tradition would only aggravate the situation.</p>
<p>That said, I believe we‚Äôre on the cusp of a cultural shift as Singapore
strengthens its position as a magnet of talent and capital. The meteoric
rise of local unicorn companies and an influx of international tech giants
will inspire Singaporeans to take on more risks to boost the economy.</p>
<h3>What has surprised you the most since joining GovTech?</h3>
<p>GovTech‚Äôs openness to public cloud services and quick adoption of cloud-native
technologies has been a pleasant eye-opener. Kudos to the organisation‚Äôs
leadership for recognising the value of cloud and embracing the paradigm
shift. The Open Government Products (OGP) team, in particular, has been
a driving force behind public cloud adoption. The speed of adoption is
perhaps also owed to most engineers‚Äô love of shiny new tech that automates
DevOps drudgery, ha!</p>
<h3>What's your favourite tech that you‚Äôve come across in Singapore so far?</h3>
<p>It has to be SingPass ‚Äì for being an identity system that is becoming
a ‚Äúsuper app‚Äù for countless digital services.</p>
<h3>Was there a moment when you knew you wanted to convert into a full-time position at GovTech?</h3>
<p>I received offers with higher compensation from the private sector but
after considering them, I concluded that the work I was doing at GovTech
was more meaningful. Friendly colleagues and a healthy culture also contributed
to my decision to stay at GovTech.</p>
<h3>What is your dream tech project? It can be anything! Flying car, teleportation device, you name it.</h3>
<p>I would go for the simplest AI model with self-consciousness.</p>
<h3>Oh dear. In many movies, self-conscious AI turns out not so good for humanity! What do you have to say about that?</h3>
<p>I suspect that self-conscious humans may pose a bigger threat to humanity
than AI does. To be on the safe side, my aspiration is not to build a superhuman
Skynet system but the simplest model with a trace of self-consciousness.
What could possibly go wrong?</p>
