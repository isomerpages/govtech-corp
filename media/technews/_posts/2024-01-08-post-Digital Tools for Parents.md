<p>Time flies! In the blink of an eye, your little tot that you cradled with
just one arm has just entered Primary 1 and survived the first week of
school!</p>
<p>As exciting as this development is, it’s also undoubtedly a stressful
moment, with a whole new schedule and environment to adapt to. It’s no
wonder parents often feel the pressure to do as much as possible to get
their kids through this transitory phase.</p>
<p>But have no fear, for tech is here to lend a helping hand once again.
We’re here to guide you along with this list of important apps and portals
that will smooth the transition for you and your child.</p>
<h3>Parents Gateway</h3>
<p>School is often a flurry of announcements, consent forms, and various
other bits of information you have to keep track of. With the&nbsp;<a href="https://pg.moe.edu.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parents Gateway</a>&nbsp;app,
you have a single platform to juggle all of these.</p>
<p>Some of the app features include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Signing consent forms for school activities (no more anxiety over kids
missing out on excursions because of forgotten consent forms!). Enable
push notifications so that you’re alerted once new consent forms are sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Booking slots for parent-teacher meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updating the school about your child’s travel plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessing parenting resources to better support your child’s education
journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do approach your child’s school to update his or her particulars in the
MOE School Records System if you have issues accessing the app.</p>
<h3>Student Learning Space</h3>
<p>When the pandemic hit, schools and students had to quickly adapt to learning
from home through online lessons. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/student-learning-space" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Student Learning Space</a>&nbsp;is
a crucial part of learning from home. It is an online learning portal where
students can access resources and tools that are aligned with the Ministry
of Education’s curriculum. Students can carry out both self-directed and
collaborative learning, making it an essential tool for e-learning days.</p>
<p>As learning needs evolve rapidly, materials on the portal are continually
improved in line with suggestions and feedback from teachers and students.
The portal adopts an agile framework so that it can quickly adapt to new
demands.</p>
<h3>LifeSG</h3>
<p>Yes, we know that life even before Primary 1 starts can be complicated.
What with the balloting, the school-home distances, the phases, and all
other crucial information.</p>
<p>Well, remember the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.life.gov.sg/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=ACCSSAlwaysOn&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAtOmsBhCnARIsAGPa5ybwCQA3BfXZbFw1FC18ruO7zdnHS_Nl_XzGhkQG_5EuVyjv-c_1TW8aApIrEALw_wcB" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LifeSG</a>&nbsp;app
and portal, where you registered your child’s birth? It’s not called LifeSG
for nothing as it truly has something for every stage of life. Head to
this handy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.life.gov.sg/guides/p1-registration" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">guide</a>&nbsp;to
get all you need to know about confirming your kid’s place in a primary
school.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are also articles about adjusting to life in primary
school, such as using recess money as a way to inculcate good financial
habits and using play activities to build interactive skills with other
children.</p>
<h3>E-payment accounts</h3>
<p>Speaking of budgeting, setting up an e-payment account for your child
is a good idea. It enables you to;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Transfer pocket money into the e-wallet digitally (no more forgetting
your child’s recess money)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track their spending in real-time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set savings goals that can be tracked over time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some services can even be used outside of school. For example, the&nbsp;

<h3>HealthHub</h3>
<p>Hands up if you remember taking your height and weight, getting immunisation
jabs, and getting dental checks in primary school, all the while recording
every measurement in your trusty health booklet.</p>
<p>Today, with the HealthHub app and portal, all your child’s health records
are at your fingertips so you know when your kid is due for immunisations
or that all-important dental appointment.</p>

as they embark on their educational journey.</p>
<h3>Keep calm and have fun</h3>
<p>Amid all the hustle and bustle, it’s easy to lose sight of one thing –
school is supposed to be fun for your little one.</p>
<p>So hopefully these tech tips take some of that burden off your shoulders
and you’re able to smile as you look as your kid walks through the school
gates. Your child’s spirits will also be lifted when they see you’re happy!</p>
