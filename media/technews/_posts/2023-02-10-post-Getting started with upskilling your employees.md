<p>As we navigate the digital age, keeping our skills up to date has become
more important than ever, with the World Economic Forum’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020/in-full/infographics-e4e69e4de7" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Future of Jobs Report 2020</a>&nbsp;estimating
that half of the global workforce will need to undergo upskilling, as companies
acknowledge that 44 per cent of the skills employees require to perform
effectively will change by 2025, making career upskilling necessary to
keep up with the changing demands of employees’ roles</p>
<p>Whether you’re a business owner or a manager in your organisation, understanding
the benefits of upskilling and how it affects your workplace is key to
future-proofing your company. Consistent training brings immense value
to your team.</p>
<p><em>Editor's note: While you might think this article is only for business owners or managers, think again! Most of the resources in this article also apply to anyone who wants to upskill to stay relevant. So read on!</em>
</p>
<h3>The benefits of career upskilling</h3>
<p>Perhaps you’re looking for ways to increase efficiency in the workplace
or target specific skill gaps your team is facing. Adopting a strategic
approach of upskilling – where employees learn new skills – can help address
this by giving employees an avenue to pick up current trends and new developments
in your industry. This can help to encourage your team members to adopt
a problem-solving mindset and avoid career stagnation.</p>
<p>For instance, encouraging your team to familiarise themselves with courses
on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Meta Blueprint</a>&nbsp;can
give them a more robust understanding of advertising platforms and digital
tools by equipping them with knowledge on how to perform functions such
as running Facebook Ads and optimising digital marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Engaging with upskilling initiatives enables employees to find more growth
in their roles, as your team can get a better perspective of their learning
and professional development goals for work and career advancement.</p>
<p>Upskilling can also help to boost morale: sending your team for upskilling
courses is a sign that you’re taking an active interest in their future,
increasing motivation in the workplace, which can raise productivity, lower
attrition rates, and improve job satisfaction.</p>
<p>According to a study conducted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/only-43-of-employees-surveyed-in-singapore-are-committed-to-staying-with-their-current-employer" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Randstand</a>,
91 per cent of the respondents surveyed in Singapore indicated an interest
in learning and development opportunities in the workplace, with 73 per
cent highlighting the importance of training and development.</p>
<h3>Getting started with upskilling your team</h3>
<p>To assess if upskilling is suitable for your employees, consider coming
up with a Personal Development Plan which provides a structured approach
to career upskilling, encourages employees to take ownership over their
own learning and professional growth, and helps you and your employees
to focus on learning content and developing the most appropriate skills.</p>
