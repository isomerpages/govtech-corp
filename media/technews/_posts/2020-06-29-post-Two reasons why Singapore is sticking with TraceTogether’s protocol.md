<h3>Although alternatives exist, here‚Äôs why the BlueTrace-powered TraceTogether is still preferred for digital contact tracing in Singapore.</h3>

<p>On 20 March 2020, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) of Singapore
released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a>, which uses
Bluetooth technology to alert users if they have been in contact with COVID-19
patients. The app was built to augment existing contact tracing efforts
so that authorities can quickly identify and quarantine close contacts
of COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Since its launch, TraceTogether, which uses the BlueTrace protocol, has
amassed more than two million users‚Äîroughly one in every three people living
in Singapore. However, for the app to have any substantial impact on contact
tracing efforts, experts believe that TraceTogether has to be downloaded
by a bigger proportion of the Singapore population.</p>
<p>One issue affecting TraceTogether‚Äôs efficacy is the fact that it does
not work well on Apple‚Äôs iOS operating system. TraceTogether has to be
kept running in the foreground for it to work most effectively, going against
user behaviour and draining battery life. To get around this problem, tech
giants Apple and Google have recently come together to launch Exposure
Notification (EN), a protocol that can run on both iOS and Android systems.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEach protocol has their own strengths. Both try to achieve the same thing,
but they both have different limitations,‚Äù observed Mr Harish Pillay, Chief
Technology Architect at open-source software provider, Red Hat.</p>
<p>In the first article of this two-part series, we lay down the reasons
why TraceTogether is better suited for Singapore‚Äôs needs.</p>
<h3>Catering to the local context</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs important to note that TraceTogether was designed specifically to
support the Ministry of Health (MOH)‚Äôs response to a public health crisis
‚Äì to intervene and quickly control the spread of the coronavirus. ‚Äú[The
app] provides contact tracers with additional information to allow them
to locate infected contacts more quickly, reducing the spread of the disease
and giving the population greater freedom to move, work and socialise than
would otherwise be possible,‚Äù noted Mr Roland Turner, Chief Privacy Officer
of relationship analytics provider TrustSphere.</p>
<p>Once a user is confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, the user is able
to upload the TraceTogether Bluetooth data. From there, MOH contact tracers
can then decrypt the list of close contacts and quickly issue quarantine
orders. To protect user data, all IDs are encrypted‚Äîwith only MOH retaining
exclusive access to the identification key.</p>
<p>However, some have raised questions about why the Government chose not
to use the EN Protocol since it would lead to higher adoption among iOS
users, and higher adoption would mean better contact tracing. In a&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Vivian.Balakrishnan.Sg/posts/10156889801466207" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>&nbsp;on 15 June, the Minister in charge of the Smart
Nation initiative, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, said that while ‚Äúit is a good
and innovative system, however, we decided that it would be less effective
in the local context.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Pinpointing the source of infection</h3>
<p>Why is this so? First, EN ultimately relies on users being responsible
by monitoring their own symptoms and uploading their data to the cloud
if they come down with COVID-19. Second, EN was designed to withhold certain
information from public health authorities like the MOH. For example, in
a situation where three infected persons, A, B and C, come into close contact
with three others, X, Y and Z, EN would notify X, Y and Z that they have
potentially been exposed but would not be able to tell if the exposure
was linked to either A, B or C.</p>
<p>So, while EN allows MOH to know who the potential close contacts of the
infected person are, contact tracers will have no way of identifying how,
when and who infected the person in the first place. Without this information,
MOH‚Äôs contact tracers cannot accurately identify the chain of transmission,
pinpoint the exact source of infection, and verify which close contacts
were indeed exposed to COVID-19. ‚ÄúThe cost of this limitation is greater
disease propagation because there‚Äôs no expert contact tracer in the loop,‚Äù
said Mr Turner.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt seems COVID-19 is a more complicated disease than EN was designed
to handle,‚Äù added open-source activist Dr Andrew ‚ÄúBunnie‚Äù Huang. ‚ÄúIn particular,
EN cannot determine the cause of infections. Asymptomatic carriers may
receive numerous notifications that they‚Äôve been exposed to COVID-19, when
in fact, they were the ones who exposed others to the virus.‚Äù Echoing Dr
Huang‚Äôs statement, firmware developer Mr Sean ‚Äúxobs‚Äù Cross concluded, ‚ÄúThe
Exposure Notification protocol is insufficient to aid in contact tracing.‚Äù</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dr Huang noted that TraceTogether‚Äôs BlueTrace protocol
has the potential to reveal the cause of infections or causality‚Äîbut only
if there are enough participants in the network. Therefore, increasing
the accessibility of TraceTogether is a top priority.</p>
<h3>TraceTogether‚Äôs accessibility</h3>
<p>However, given that approximately one out of every five Singaporeans still
does not own a smartphone, there is a need for TraceTogether to be more
than an app to achieve greater coverage. ‚ÄúNot everyone can afford a smartphone,
and older smartphone models or operating system versions do not run the
BlueTrace or EN protocol well. In order to extend effective protection
to as many people as possible, we had to consider [hardware] tokens that
would be simpler, more effective and more convenient than phones,‚Äù noted
Minister Balakrishnan.</p>
<p>A new portable device, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/media-releases/2020-06-16-tracetogether-token-media-statement" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TraceTogether Token</a>,
will help address some of the challenges faced by the mobile app, such
as the need for maximum effectiveness and battery drain.</p>
<p>Such an option, however, wouldn‚Äôt have been possible with EN, which is
limited to the iOS and Android operating systems. As a home-grown solution
designed to meet the country‚Äôs needs, TraceTogether and the underlying
BlueTrace protocol are an example of how tech can be harnessed to support
a very human endeavour‚Äîthe specialised and professional work of our contact
tracers. Watch out for the second part of this series, where we‚Äôll be sharing
ongoing efforts to improve TraceTogether by engaging with the wider community.</p>
