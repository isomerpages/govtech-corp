<p>When Mr Bertrand Lee returned to Singapore from Hong Kong, he joined a
company that developed chatbots, which are computer programs that simulate
human conversations and act as virtual assistants. While the value of these
chatbots became quickly apparent to Lee, he also realised that the chatbots
had the potential to be so much more.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt can be a frustrating experience having to wait in line or be on hold
for 10-15 minutes before reaching customer service to get the job done,‚Äù
Lee said. The alternative to a friendly human being would be an online-based
service, but it cannot respond the same way a service personnel can, he
noted.</p>
<p>Chatbots tread a fine line between cold efficiency and the human touch,
Lee said. ‚ÄúI believe that chatbots will make a significant impact in the
lives of many Singaporeans, by improving the way we engage with government
services.‚Äù</p>
<p>This motivation to harness technology to make a difference is what ultimately
drove Lee to join the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/careers/smart-nation-fellowship-programme/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech)‚Äôs Smart Nation Fellowship Programme</a>.
In this interview, Lee shares his experience as a Smart Nation Fellow,
as well as his views on the future of chatbots for the delivery of government
services.</p>
<h3>Getting into talks with GovTech</h3>
<p>Before Lee moved to Hong Kong, he spent 13 years in the United States
working for technology giant Microsoft and a series of startups. One of
his first forays into the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP)‚Äîa
field of artificial intelligence (AI) that studies the interactions between
computers and humans using human languages‚Äîwas to build a conversational
AI assistant in cars that could make calls or give directions based on
voice commands.</p>
<p>Lee‚Äôs expertise in conversational AI and chatbots later came into play
when he was searching for a consulting role in Singapore. He was introduced
to the Smart Nation Fellowship Programme at GovTech, where he met the team
developing the government chatbot platform.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat motivated me to join GovTech was the chance to work on something
that I knew could impact the lives of all my fellow Singaporeans,‚Äù Lee
said. Aside from giving back to Singapore, he was also drawn to the programme‚Äôs
flexibility. The Smart Nation Fellowship Programme, which connects established
professionals with GovTech for three to six months, could accommodate Lee
as a part-time consultant working three days a week. Industry professionals
can even join as Technical Mentors to guide GovTech‚Äôs project teams.</p>
<h3>Speaking of chatbots</h3>
<p>After joining GovTech, Lee became a member of the team that developed
the government chatbot&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/ask-jamie/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AskJamie</a>,
which is programmed to respond to questions that range from tax queries
to licence renewals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChatbots could potentially be the most scalable and effective way to
improve how Singaporeans transact with the government,‚Äù said Lee. Not only
are chatbots able to process and retrieve information faster than any customer
service professional, they can also simulate human interactions and make
the experience less impersonal. ‚ÄúChatbots could be that happy medium between
interactivity and scalability,‚Äù he quipped.</p>
<p>For chatbots to be effective, however, they need to predict user intent
better and be more personable, Lee said. ‚ÄúFirst-generation chatbots do
not predict user intent very well‚Äîthey often get confused or fail to understand
what the user is saying,‚Äù he explained. Furthermore, the chatbots cannot
pick up on details such as date and time to retrieve a more relevant answer.</p>
<p>But recent advances in big data and computing power could make these goals
possible, he said. The team at GovTech is developing the Virtual Intelligent
Citizen Assistant (VICA), a platform that lets them build even better chatbots.
‚ÄúOne of VICA‚Äôs goals is to make our chatbots engine-agnostic, which means
that the chatbots can leverage the latest NLP technology to achieve better
performance,‚Äù he said.</p>
<h3>A ‚Äòsuper‚Äô chatbot in the making</h3>
<p>Building a ‚Äòsuper‚Äô chatbot is the Holy Grail for the team behind VICA,
Lee said. By integrating analytics and chatbot data, such as utterances
and user intents, across all government agencies, they aim to develop a
centralised ‚Äòsuper‚Äô chatbot for the entire Singapore government.</p>
<p>Not only will a whole-of-government chatbot boost efficiency, but it will
likely enhance the user experience across the entire service journey, from
returning personalised responses to web integration among agencies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUsing chatbots to streamline government services can bring about very
obvious improvements to the end-user experience,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúThe whole
idea is that there are so many government agencies. With a chatbot like
this, all the users need to do is to go onto a single chatbot for anything
they need.‚Äù</p>
<p>Like Alexa, Google or Siri, the Singapore Government could one day have
their very own virtual assistant. Such a chatbot would enable citizens
to transact with the government seamlessly, without end-users ever becoming
privy to the mundane, administrative processes that keep government agencies
running.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúImagine a time where you could throw any government-related request to
this virtual assistant‚Äîthere is so much more to the future of chatbots.‚Äù</p>
<p></p>
