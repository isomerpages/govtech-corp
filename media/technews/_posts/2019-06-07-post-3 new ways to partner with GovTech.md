<h3>Procurement procedures typically set out rigid specifications and timelines for industry partners to fulfil. GovTech is introducing a new procurement framework to increase the flexibility of collaboration with partners.</h3>
<p>A Government technology procurement process typically goes like this:
an agency raises a tech need, goes through a process to source for the
right solution and awards to industry partners that are selected based
on agreed terms. These partners are required to work based on an outcome-defined
and timeline-based framework.</p>
<p>In fast-moving and experimental areas, the lack of flexibility once the
project requirements have been set can cause solutions developed by the
vendor to be quickly overtaken by newer approaches or, worse, be deemed
irrelevant to their use case. Projects based on the waterfall model and
full stack requirements‚Äîas opposed to the agile development methodology‚Äîmay
be challenging for smaller companies to value-add.</p>
<p>The Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) has realised the
need to streamline its information and communication technology (ICT) contracts.
During the Smart Nation &amp; Digital Government Industry Briefing 2019,
Ms Mah Yu Ling, Director of Procurement at GovTech, shared three new partnership
models that GovTech will be using in upcoming industry collaborations.
She also highlighted opportunities for industry players to work with the
government to create value for citizens and businesses.</p>
<h3>From outsourcing to co-developing</h3>
<p>Outsourcing projects to the industry has been the modus operandi for GovTech
to expand its product development capabilities. These partnerships have
traditionally been established through contracts where specifications are
spelt out from the start, and partners are expected to develop solutions
independently. However, this may not be optimal when exact methodologies
are not known early on or when ready-made solutions are not available in
the market.</p>
<p>GovTech is now looking to co-develop technologies with industry partners
by working together directly in trials to develop bespoke solutions to
the problem statements. ‚ÄúWhen partners meet the performance mark, they
can continue to co-develop more projects with us and perhaps even take
over the running of the systems,‚Äù said Ms Mah. She emphasised that GovTech
welcomes partners of different sizes and areas of expertise and hopes to
extend collaborations into other fields of emerging technology.</p>
<h3>Dynamic contracts</h3>
<p>While past contracts had only one point of entry, more companies will
stand to gain in the new procurement model of dynamic contracting, where
new suppliers can be introduced throughout the contract period via a supplementary
invitation. For companies that have missed the call for ideas earlier,
these changes will be reflected in new bulk tenders during the upcoming
financial year, said Ms Mah.</p>
<p>The collaboration will also be more long-term to allow sufficient runway
for new partners to prove their capabilities to service the agencies. ‚ÄúHaving
heard feedback that our contracts lockout partners when they miss the bulk
tender, we hope that the closer collaboration and flexibility for rapid
changes will provide more opportunities for companies to join our panel
of suppliers,‚Äù said Ms Mah.</p>
<h3>Integrated and inclusive call for solutions</h3>
<p>Promising ideas can come from crowdsourcing platforms like hackathons,
but a separate procurement process to implement those ideas adds a layer
of complexity that might just quell their potential. To refine this workflow,
Ms Mah shared about an outcome-based call for solutions in which proposals
are shortlisted based on preliminary criteria, and selected partners will
be allowed to refine their proposals as more details are released. The
new proposals are then evaluated for the final awarding of the different
stages of the project.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs the ideas move through different stages of development, we can find
out if solutions do not actually address the initial problem, in a single
procurement exercise. This allows for innovation through trials and experimentation,
preventing technologies from turning obsolete and fail fast quickly when
the outcomes are less idle,‚Äù said Ms Mah.</p>
<p>She also stressed that GovTech will be making collaboration opportunities
accessible to companies regardless of size. Other procurement opportunities
are done through the government e-procurement portal GeBIZ, where companies
had to first meet financial requirements for certain tenders. The Call
for Solutions negates those criteria as it will be on Info-communications
Media Development Authority‚Äôs open innovation platform, lowering the barrier
of entry for smaller companies.</p>
