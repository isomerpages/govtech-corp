  to today. Explore roles like cloud engineers and UX designers shaping the tech
  industry!

<p>NGL (Not gonna lie, try to keep up), the early 2010s were quite a crazy
time to be alive. Believe it or not, iPhones didn’t come with four cameras.
Memes used the font “impact”. For a while, some of us believed that the
world was going to end in 2012. (Ashton Kutcher, we’re looking at you.)
Spoiler alert: It did not.</p>
<p>Of course, the jobs people worked in then? They were very different. Because
of how fast technologies such as big data, cloud computing and even social
media have sprouted, we enjoy career opportunities today that the early-2010s
Singaporeans could only dream of. Let’s have a look at some of them.</p>

<h3>Drone Pilot</h3>
<p>Okay, we’re kinda cheating with the first one.</p>
<p>If you wanna be pedantic about it, the Air Force was already hiring for
UAV pilots in 2011.</p>
<p>However, we’d argue that drone operators – particularly those who’d use
drones for non-military purposes - were definitely not mainstream.</p>
<p>By now, you might have seen this meme – in just 10 years, both the cameraman
and the helicopter pilot (assuming they only fly for filming purposes)
were made redundant.</p>

<p>While you might have gotten used to the bird’s eye view that drones provide,
it’s easy to forget that they’re only a recent invention. It was only in
2014 that drones were legalised in the United States for filming purposes.
Singapore passed its very own Unmanned Aircraft Bill back in 2015.</p>
<p>Today in Singapore, drones are used for anything ranging from aerial photography
to police surveillance, island maintenance and building inspections. Delivery
folks are generally still safe from drones, but trials are ongoing.</p>
<p>Fun fact: The first iteration of DJI’s now ubiquitous and wildly popular
Phantom drone appeared in 2013.</p>
<h3>DevOps Engineer</h3>
<p>‘DevSecOps’ might sound like an intimidating phrase, but if you break
it down, it actually means Development, Security and Operations engineer.
Less scary now, ain’t it? Put simply, the folks in DevOps (and DevSecOps)
are tech generalists who do everything from software development to operations
and cybersecurity. Which, if you think about it, is an extremely wide range
of roles.</p>
<p>While DevOps seems like the natural thing to do, it wasn’t always this
way. Not too long ago, the tech world practised a ‘waterfall philosophy’,
which also applied in the manufacturing and construction industries. The
term ‘waterfall’ was used because the workflow was like this: Conception
-&gt; Initiation -&gt; Analysis -&gt; Design -&gt; Construction -&gt; Testing
-&gt; Deployment and maintenance</p>
<p>This is often known as a linear workflow model – which flows downwards,
step by step. Hence the name ‘Waterfall’. However, as people would soon
realise, just because something works well in some industries, doesn’t
mean it would work well in others.</p>
<p>The waterfall approach simply wasn’t flexible enough for the fast-moving
tech industry, where everything needed to be fluid. As a result, Agile
philosophy was created, and DevOps Engineers were the people who could
make this happen.</p>
<p>To put it simply, DevOps brings operations teams into development so that
continuous integration and delivery is possible – which is at the core
of the Agile philosophy!</p>
<h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
<p>Not too long ago, developers were split into two broad camps.</p>
<p>Front-end vs back-end.</p>
<p>You can think of front-end development as the client side of the two,
heavily involved with presentations. Indeed, front-end web development
involves converting data to a graphical interface through the use of languages
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and/or other apps.</p>

</p>
<p>Back-end developers, on the other hand, deal with the behind-the-scenes;
every back end of a website involves a server, an application, and a database.</p>
<p>Of course, at some point over the last 10 years, the demands of the job
started to increase, and the two camps started converging their skill sets
to get what you call a ‘full stack developer.’</p>
<p>As you probably guessed, if developers were a meal, full stack developers
are kinda like a five-star buffet – expecting to offer variety and versatility
in their skill sets in both disciplines.</p>
<p>It’s little wonder why they’ve become one of the most sought-after talents
in recent history.</p>
<h3>UI/UX Designer</h3>
<p>Do you remember website design from 10 years ago? Here, let me jog your
memory.</p>

<p>See how terrible it looks? In the past, websites were created with little
or no UI/UX principles in mind. All that changed when smartphones hit the
scene in the 2010s. You could argue that the need for mobile websites and
apps gave rise to the need for intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces.</p>
<p>If you go back even further, the UI/UX term was first coined in 1993 by
the cognitive psychologist and designer Don Norman when he worked at Apple.</p>
<p>These days, UI and UX are entire disciplines on their own and are integral
parts of any tech company. In the highly competitive tech sector, ease
of use and convenience, UI/UX plays a huge role in producing a finished
product that allows customers to interact with businesses easily.</p>
<p>With that said, UI and UX roles are often confused, though there are slight
differences.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>User interface (UI) refers to how a website, app or any digital media
looks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User experience (UX) is about how easily a user can interact with the
program. For example, making websites easy to navigate and interact with
other platforms like social media.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cloud Infrastructure Engineer</h3>
<p>Aeons ago, in the 2000s, long before Google Drive and Amazon Web Services,
companies stored their data on physical computers called data centres.
These servers took up plenty of room, were expensive, crashed regularly,
and became obsolete very quickly.</p>
<p>These days, cloud computing has changed all that. Companies can effectively
rent their data centres from cloud companies who maintain those computers
– and, in the process, lower costs via achieving economies of scale.</p>
<p>Look, cloud computing might sound like a great idea today, but when it
first came out, there was massive resistance to it. Think about it: companies
spending millions and billions of dollars on their own data centres, only
to find out there’s a cheaper and more convenient solution out there? That’s
the perfect case of the sunk cost fallacy.</p>
<p>Either way, we know how history played out – in the 2010s, cloud computing
eventually overcame the naysayers. Cloud computing professionals are now
amongst the hottest talents in Singapore, and just about everyone is hiring
them.</p>
<p>Today, Cloud Infrastructure Engineers lead, architect and develop cloud
and infrastructure solutions that have integration to various on-premise
or SaaS (Software as a service) solutions.</p>
<h3>We don’t know what we don’t know</h3>
<p>Before you laugh at the sceptics who didn’t quite see the paradigm shifts
in job roles, it’s important to realise that we one day might be in their
shoes. In the same way, they couldn’t predict the jobs of today in the
2010s… we can’t help but wonder what will be the hot jobs of the 2030s
– given how technology continues to develop at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>The best thing we can do? Keep our skills updated, stay abreast of the
latest developments, and do a career check-up often.</p>
<p>Here’s to hoping content writers are still needed in the 2030s.</p>
