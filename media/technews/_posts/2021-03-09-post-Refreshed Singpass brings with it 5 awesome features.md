</p>
<p>Of the 4 million residents on Singpass, more than 2.5 million users are
on the Singpass app, and over 90% of them use the app at least once a month.
The Singpass app is also one of the most downloaded apps in Singapore in
2020 and has tripled its user base in the past year. If you’re a responsible
citizen, you’d know the app from all the times you used it for your SafeEntry
check-ins&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20210104-release-of-2020-singapore-cambridge-gce-o-level-examination-results-and-2021-joint-admissions-exercise" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">(and flexing your ‘O’ level results)</a>.</p>
<p>This month though, everyone’s favourite government app has undergone a
brand refresh. Besides the obvious logo change, the team has been working
on making the app even more feature-packed and useful.</p>
<p>Here are the five new features that will most certainly make your life
better.</p>
<h3>Digital signing of contracts</h3>
<p>Find physically signing papers a chore? So do we.</p>
<p>Print a document, sign it, and then source an envelope to mail it off
at the post office, only to have your signature rejected since you can’t
remember which signature you used previously! – we’ve known people who’ve
procrastinated on important tasks because of this!</p>
<p>Well, Singapore residents can now use Singpass to digitally sign documents,
remotely authorise transactions, retrieve their personal information and
conveniently access more services across sectors – ranging from banking
and insurance, to healthcare and charities. These are all done on one trusty
Singpass app without the use of passwords!</p>
<p>How will the digitalising of everyday transactions help? Well, apart from
saving you trips to the post office, the streamlined processes will also
result in quicker approvals for applications!</p>
<p>Ah! I know what you’re thinking about – will digital signatures and transactions
truly be safe? Well, read on to find out.</p>
<h3>Face Verification as a 2FA mode</h3>
<p>The new Singpass features even more authentication methods to make digital
transactions fuss-free for everyone.</p>
<p>Users with smartphones can use their Singpass app to verify their identity
using their fingerprint, face or passcode when accessing services.</p>
<p>As for users without smartphones, you can still authenticate easily by
using a face scan matched against the government’s biometric database when
accessing services on a web or mobile browser using a camera-enabled device
(e.g. computer with web camera or mobile phone with a front-facing camera).
Of course, SMS Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) remains available.</p>
<p>Self-help kiosks at selected government agencies also support Face Verification
for logins to government digital services. Face Verification is used as
an additional layer of authentication to ascertain that the user is physically
present during a transaction.</p>
<h3>Digital IC</h3>
<p>Are you a scatterbrain who lost your IC multiple times? Oof, those $300
replacement fees certainly must have hurt. Thanks to Singpass, misplacing
your IC might soon be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>From September 2020, you can carry your IC together within your smartphone
using the Singpass app! It can be used as an alternative method of identity
verification for certain purposes, such as scanning your Digital IC barcode
at kiosks located in libraries and polyclinics.</p>
<p>(That said, your physical IC is still needed for certain transactions)</p>
<h3>Singpass Myinfo</h3>
<p>You’d already know how Myinfo speeds things up for you, auto-filling all
those pesky fields on online application forms. This is the result of agencies
and businesses tapping on the Myinfo API to make application faster and
way less tedious.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Singpass application programming interfaces (API), businesses
big and small can tap on a variety of Singpass features to enhance customer
experiences and improve business efficiency.</p>
<p>Myinfo also powers your profile in your Singpass app, where you now have
all your important information on hand. Rest assured, it’s still as secure
as authentication is required each time you view your profile.</p>
<p>If you ask us, that’s a win – faster and more efficient digital services
mean that you get to spend more time doing the stuff you love!</p>
<h3>More accessible Government services</h3>
<p>To ensure Singpass services are easy to use for everyone, key transactional
pages on the Singpass website and app will be available in Singapore’s
four official languages by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who are overloaded with information watching those
budget briefings, you can now check out the benefits you’re entitled to
on your Singpass app. How easy!</p>
