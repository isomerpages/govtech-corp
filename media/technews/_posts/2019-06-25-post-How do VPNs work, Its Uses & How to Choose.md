<p>The shift to remote work accelerated digital transformation but also presented
cybercriminals with opportunities to target less secure home networks.
The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 saw a surge in malicious
online activity, with over 2,000 pandemic-related domain names registered
in just three months. Singapore itself experienced phishing scams exploiting
public concern.</p>
<p>When accessing company information online, your data's journey can be
vulnerable to interception. To mitigate these risks and protect your online
communication, this article will explain how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
work and how you use them, addressing questions like why do I need a VPN
and is it necessary.</p>
<h3>What is a VPN?</h3>
<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) establishes what is essentially a secure,
encrypted connection for your internet traffic. When you connect via a
VPN, all data transmitted from your device is first encoded and then routed
through a dedicated VPN server, shielding it from unauthorised access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both your incoming and outgoing online communications are channelled through
this secure server, rendering them concealed from your Internet Service
Provider (ISP) and network administrators. The primary use of a VPN is
to ensure that your online activities remain private, safeguarding them
from potential eavesdropping by malicious actors, the websites you visit,
and even your ISP.</p>
<h4>How do VPNs work?</h4>

<p>Spend 10 seconds on this diagram, and you will know how a VPN works!</p>
<p>A VPN creates a secure, encrypted “tunnel” between your device and the
internet. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Connecting to a VPN server:</strong> Your device first establishes
a connection to a VPN server, which is maintained by the VPN provider.
This server acts as an intermediary point for all your online traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encryption:</strong> Once connected, all data transmitted between
your device and the VPN server is encrypted. This process scrambles your
data, making it unreadable to anyone who might be trying to intercept it
along the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Masking of IP address:</strong> The VPN server replaces your device’s
actual IP address with its own. This makes it appear as if your internet
activity is originating from the VPN server's location, effectively hiding
your identity and location from websites and online services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why do I need a VPN &amp; is it necessary?</h3>
<p>For individuals working remotely or frequently using public Wi-Fi in places
like airports and cafes, a VPN offers a layer of security. In these environments,
your internet connection becomes a potential target for cyber threats,
with risks ranging from eavesdropping to data interception.</p>
<p>A VPN addresses this by creating a secure, encrypted tunnel for your online
activity usage, shielding your communications and masking your IP address,
thus providing essential protection in vulnerable digital spaces.</p>
<h4>Understanding the risks of not using a VPN</h4>
<p>Without the security provided by a VPN, your internet traffic is inherently
exposed, leaving you vulnerable to various online threats. Your data transmissions
can be intercepted by malicious actors, and your online activities can
be tracked by websites, advertisers, and even your Internet Service Provider.
This increases the potential for data theft, identity theft, and unauthorised
access to your sensitive personal and professional information.</p>
<h3>What is VPN used for: Key benefits</h3>
<p>A VPN offers several key benefits that enhance online security and privacy.</p>
<h4>Secure your data &amp; privacy</h4>
<p>By masking your IP address, a VPN helps protect your identity and browsing
habits from websites, advertisers, and potential hackers, enhancing your
online privacy.</p>
<h4>Secure data transmission</h4>
<p>VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, safeguarding sensitive information
such as passwords, emails, and financial transactions from cyber threats
during transmission.</p>
<h4>Access to restricted content</h4>
<p>By connecting to servers in different locations, VPNs allow you to bypass
geo-restrictions and access content available in other regions.</p>
<h4>Safe use of public Wi-Fi</h4>
<p>When connected to public Wi-Fi networks, VPNs encrypt your internet connection,
protecting your data from potential interception. While a VPN masks your
public IP address from apps and websites, using split tunnelling might
not fully conceal your location. This masking of your IP address prevents
snooping on your online activity.</p>
<h4>Protection against cyberattacks and malicious websites</h4>
<p>While not a direct antivirus, a VPN can offer a degree of protection by
encrypting your connection, making it harder for some types of cyberattacks,
like those on public Wi-Fi, to succeed. Additionally, some VPN services
may offer features that warn against or block known malicious websites.</p>
<h3>When do you need a VPN: Use cases</h3>
<p>VPN usage proves particularly useful in various online scenarios to enhance
security, privacy, and access.</p>
<h4>Enhancing security with remote work</h4>
<p>When working from home or accessing your organisation's digital resources
remotely, a VPN establishes a secure and encrypted connection to the company's
internal network. This ensures that sensitive corporate data remains protected
from potential interception as it travels over the internet.</p>
<h4>Travelling abroad</h4>
<p>While overseas, you might encounter restrictions on accessing services
or content that are typically available in Singapore. VPN usage allows
you to connect to servers located in Singapore, effectively bypassing these
geo-restrictions and enabling access to your familiar online services and
content.</p>
<h4>Online shopping and banking</h4>
<p>Engaging in online transactions, such as shopping or banking, involves
transmitting sensitive financial information. A VPN encrypts your internet
traffic, adding an extra layer of security to protect your passwords, account
details, and transaction data from potential cyber threats.</p>
<h3>Importance of choosing a secure VPN</h3>
<p>Choosing a trustworthy VPN is crucial for effective online protection.
Prioritise reputable providers over free, less reliable options. Here's
how to verify a secure VPN:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong encryption:</strong> Ensure the VPN uses robust encryption
like AES-256. Check their website for encryption details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No-logs privacy policy:</strong> Verify a clear policy stating
they do not log your online activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency &amp; audits:</strong> Look for published transparency
reports and independent security audit reports on the provider's website
and via cybersecurity review sites like <a href="https://www.security.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Security.org</u></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kill switch &amp; DNS leak protection:</strong> Confirm the VPN
offers a kill switch to prevent data leaks if the connection drops, and
DNS leak protection to maintain anonymity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SG legal compliance:</strong> Ensure the provider complies with
data protection laws in Singapore; review their terms and privacy policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to choose the right VPN provider: 4 key considerations</h3>
<p>Selecting the appropriate VPN provider requires careful consideration
of your specific usage and the provider's reliability. While numerous online
reviews exist, focusing on these key aspects will guide your decision:</p>
<h4>1. Think about your use case</h4>
<p>Your individual requirements and usage will significantly influence the
type of VPN needed. Frequent travellers should prioritise robust security
and worldwide server coverage. Families might need VPNs supporting multiple
simultaneous connections. For streaming and large data transfers, reliable
connections and unlimited bandwidth are essential. Define your desired
features before evaluating providers.</p>
<h4>2. Data privacy and security</h4>
<p>As all your internet activity will be routed through the VPN provider's
servers, their data logging policies are critical. Review their Terms of
Service for details on data logging. For security, check their encryption
protocols; modern protocols like OpenVPN are preferable to outdated options
like PPTP. Reputable providers often publish security audit reports from
independent firms for added assurance.</p>
<h4>3. Keep trade-offs in mind</h4>
<p>VPN providers with extensive global server networks can generally offer
faster data transmission speeds, though this often comes with a higher
subscription cost. Plus, stronger security measures might slightly reduce
connection speed. Some providers offer adjustable encryption levels, allowing
you to balance security and speed according to your needs.</p>
<h4>4. Read reviews and check trustworthiness</h4>
<p>Similar to online shopping, reviewing VPN providers can offer insights
into their reliability and customer satisfaction. Consult reputable websites
that publish rankings of top VPN providers and cross-reference these reviews.
Furthermore, consider whether the provider offers 24-hour customer service,
which can be crucial for resolving setup or connection issues.</p>
<h3>Common risks and mistakes to avoid during VPN usage</h3>
<p>VPN usage can greatly improve your online security and privacy, but certain
oversights and choices can undermine its effectiveness. Awareness of these
common pitfalls is crucial to ensure you are truly protected.</p>
<h4>1. Choosing unreliable or free VPN provider</h4>
<p>Opting for a free or unverified VPN service can introduce significant
risks. Such providers may have weak security measures, log your online
activity and sell it to third parties, or even bundle malware with their
applications. Entrusting your data to an unreliable VPN can be more detrimental
than not using one at all.</p>
<h4>2. Failing to disconnect when not in use</h4>
<p>While a VPN provides protection when active, leaving it connected unnecessarily
might not always be optimal. It can potentially slow down your internet
speed for activities where its security benefits are not essential. Keeping
a persistent connection might, in some rare cases, present unforeseen vulnerabilities
if the VPN service itself experiences a breach, too.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Using VPNs with weak encryption or no kill switch</h4>
<p>Not all VPNs offer the same level of security. Using a VPN with weak encryption
protocols can still leave your data vulnerable to determined cyber threats.
Also, the absence of a kill switch feature is a risk. If your VPN connection
drops unexpectedly, your internet traffic will revert to your default connection,
potentially exposing your data without your knowledge.</p>
<h3>Maintain your online security</h3>
<p>While a VPN is valuable for improving your online security, it is crucial
to recognise that it forms part of a broader strategy for digital safety.
Think of it as one important step in a comprehensive approach to protecting
your online life.</p>
<p>To truly secure your digital presence, consider implementing a range of
best practices. Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible
adds a second layer of defence against unauthorised access. Employing a
reputable password manager to generate and securely store strong, unique
passwords for all your online accounts is equally vital.</p>
<p>Regularly updating your devices and applications ensures that known security
vulnerabilities are addressed. Lastly, remaining vigilant against phishing
attempts and securing your home or business Wi-Fi network are essential
measures.</p>
<p>By adopting these habits alongside VPN usage, individuals and businesses
can strengthen their online security posture. For more detailed guidance
on safeguarding your digital life, we encourage you to explore resources
