<p>The shift to remote work accelerated digital transformation but also presented
cybercriminals with opportunities to target less secure home networks.
The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 saw a surge in malicious
online activity, with over 2,000 pandemic-related domain names registered
in just three months. Singapore itself experienced phishing scams exploiting
public concern.</p>
<p>When accessing company information online, your data's journey can be
vulnerable to interception. To mitigate these risks and protect your online
communication, this article will explain how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
work and how you use them, addressing questions like why do I need a VPN
and is it necessary.</p>
<h3>What is a VPN?</h3>
<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) establishes what is essentially a secure,
encrypted connection for your internet traffic. When you connect via a
VPN, all data transmitted from your device is first encoded and then routed
through a dedicated VPN server, shielding it from unauthorised access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both your incoming and outgoing online communications are channelled through
this secure server, rendering them concealed from your Internet Service
Provider (ISP) and network administrators. The primary use of a VPN is
to ensure that your online activities remain private, safeguarding them
from potential eavesdropping by malicious actors, the websites you visit,
and even your ISP.</p>
<h4>How do VPNs work?</h4>

<p>Spend 10 seconds on this diagram, and you will know how a VPN works!</p>
<p>A VPN creates a secure, encrypted “tunnel” between your device and the
internet. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Connecting to a VPN server:</strong> Your device first establishes
a connection to a VPN server, which is maintained by the VPN provider.
This server acts as an intermediary point for all your online traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encryption:</strong> Once connected, all data transmitted between
your device and the VPN server is encrypted. This process scrambles your
data, making it unreadable to anyone who might be trying to intercept it
along the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Masking of IP address:</strong> The VPN server replaces your device’s
actual IP address with its own. This makes it appear as if your internet
activity is originating from the VPN server's location, effectively hiding
your identity and location from websites and online services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
