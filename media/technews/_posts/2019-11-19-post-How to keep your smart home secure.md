<h3>With smart home devices becoming mainstream, here are some key security vulnerabilities to pay attention to, alongside tips for keeping your smart home â€˜hacker-freeâ€™.</h3>
<p>Everything from our phones to our watches is getting the prefix â€˜smartâ€™
these days, so why should our homes be any different? A key goal of embedding
â€˜intelligenceâ€™ into things and spaces is convenience, so imagine being
able to toggle a light switch using your smartphone, or activating the
air conditioning using just your voice. With the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled
switches and sensors communicating with a connected home assistant, you
could do all these and more from the comfort of your couch.</p>
<p>Tempting as it may be to set up a smart home, keep in mind that increased
connectivity comes with its own risksâ€”in particular, higher exposure to
cybersecurity threats. The prospects of having your â€˜smart light bulbsâ€™
locked down by ransomware are very real, and they could result in you having
to spend the night navigating around your own home by candlelight! Here
are some ways hackers could give â€˜home invasionâ€™ a whole new meaning.</p>
<h3>The â€˜headâ€™ of the house</h3>
<p>If you are using IoT-enabled devices in your smart home, the odds are
high that you have a smart home hub for configuring and controlling them.
Being the brains of the entire system, the smart home hub is a valuable
target for malicious actors since it gives them the ability to take over
practically every other gadget in the house.</p>
<p>For example, two security researchers exploited three vulnerabilities
in a smart home hub developed by a Croatian company, tricking the device
into thinking they were the homeowners. They gained the highest level of
access to the homeâ€™s command centre and used their illegitimately obtained
privileges to open a door by releasing the smart digital lock on it.</p>
<h3>The chink in the armour</h3>
<p>Even if you are confident that your smart home hub is secure, it does
not necessarily mean that every IoT device linked to it shares the same
level of protection against cyberattacks. Often, hackers search for the
weakest link in the chain of smart home devices, and once theyâ€™ve found
it, they use it as a foothold to disrupt other networked items.</p>
<p>Research by Hewlett Packard has shown that 70 per cent of consumer IoT
devices have insecure web interfaces. This means that they have poor session
management and weak default credentials, which are essentially a welcome
mat for hackers to infiltrate home networks.</p>
<h3>Walls have ears, and hedges have eyes</h3>
<p>Although smart devices are designed to be quiet and unobtrusive, the network
traffic that they transmit and receive can be a treasure trove of insight
into our personal lifestyles and habits. Even though traffic passing through
these devices is usually encrypted, a hacker could take advantage of various
security loopholes in the transmission protocols to decrypt the network
packets and gain access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, IoT devices typically collect at least one piece of personal
information and store it on board the device or sync it with a cloud server.
Cybercriminals may steal this information and use it to attempt to breach
other systems in your smart home.</p>
<p>Worrying as these security risks may be, your dream of creating a smart
home need not be shelved indefinitely. Our GovTech cybersecurity specialist,
Goh Jing Loon, shares three concrete measures you can take to keep cybercriminals
outside the gate.</p>

<h4>1. A secure boot ensures you start on the right foot</h4>
<p>Hackers may modify the firmware of your smart home devices so that when
the device boots up, the malicious code gets executed instead of or alongside
the operating system. This could result in device failure or handover control
of the device to the malicious actor.</p>
<p>Therefore, when purchasing a smart home device, check if it has a smart
boot function that you can enable. This ensures that the device checks
the boot code and only allows trusted code embedded in the device to run.</p>
<h4>2. Move with the times and update</h4>
<p>If you are hoping to get the most bang for your buck, then you would want
to use your smart home devices for as long as possible. However, beware
of outdated security protocols, which could be exploited by hackers.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should purchase devices that can receive security patches.
User behaviour also mattersâ€”be sure to check for security updates regularly
and install them promptly.</p>
<h4>3. Brand names do matter</h4>
<p>There is a range of smart home devices on the market, and those from well-established
brands may cost more. This premium pricing does bring some peace of mind
since large and reputable tech companies are more likely to actively monitor
security vulnerabilities and anticipate new ones.</p>
<p>Having said that, some degree of due diligence is needed on the part of
the consumerâ€”one should perform a market survey and look out for brands
that are trustworthy and reliable in rolling out security updates in a
timely manner.</p>
