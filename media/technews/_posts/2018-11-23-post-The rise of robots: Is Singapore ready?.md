<p>TL:DR: Singapore is second only to South Korea in terms of installation
of industrial robots. Speakers at the Singapore International Robo Expo
2018 highlighted three trends in robotics technologies that businesses
can leverage on. They also highlighted the importance of 5G networks for
larger-scale multi-robot deployments.</p>
<hr>
<p>Authors of science fiction enjoy extolling robots or painting them as
bringers of dystopia. Nonetheless, viewed as a tool of industry, robots
represent tireless workers, subservient and impervious to danger. It comes
as no surprise, then, that countries around the world are embracing automata.
Singapore is no different.</p>
<p>“In Asia, Singapore is regionally competitive. We have seen a very healthy
start-up ecosystem with a lot of support from the government and the tertiary
education system,” said Mr Su Jian Lye, principal analyst at consultancy
firm ABI Research, speaking at a symposium at the Singapore International
Robo Expo on 2 November 2018.</p>
<p>Titled ‘The Robotics Landscape in Singapore and Beyond’, the session also
included Professor Wang Dan Wei, president of the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers Robotics and Automation Society (Singapore Chapter),
and Mr Jim Lim, global director of Huawei International, as speakers.</p>

<h3>Robots, at your service</h3>
<p>Acknowledging the potential of automation, the Singapore government has
pushed hard for robotics, particularly in the healthcare and construction
industry. Singapore is second only to South Korea in terms of its installation
of industrial robots, with 488 robots per 10,000 employees, according to
an International Federation of Robotics report.</p>
<p>To maximise the return on investment in robotics, however, Mr Su advised
the public and private sector to capitalize on three main trends: autonomous
mobile robots, robots-as-a-service business models and cognitive robotics.</p>
<p>He added that the government and trade associations need to develop a
deep understanding of autonomous mobile robots and learn how best to use
them to augment workforce capabilities. At the same time, employees must
be trained to work alongside robots or retrained to take on tasks that
cannot be automated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to help robotics technologies propagate across industries,
Mr Su recommended the “robotics-as-a-service” business model.</p>
<p>“The industry has been focusing on the sales of robots for a very long
time. Instead, businesses should look at acquiring robots as a service,”
he said, noting that robots have been ‘rented out’ as companions of the
elderly in their homes, or as customer service officers at hotels.</p>
<h3>The best is yet to be</h3>
<p>But there is still room for improvement in robotics technologies, especially
in the enhancement of their cognitive functions. The previous generation
of robots is capable of performing repetitive tasks, but the coming generation
must be able to understand the environment and make decisions—this is where
artificial intelligence comes into play, said Mr Su.</p>
<p>Professor Wang agreed, highlighting that Nanyang Technological University,
Singapore, has partnered with ST Engineering to empower robots to function
in unknown and unstructured environments, such as public spaces where human
traffic may be unpredictable.</p>
<p>As one of the principal investigators of the collaboration, Professor
Wang explained that much of the work involves developing fundamental algorithms
for navigation, localization and data acquisition. The lab is also exploring
the use of fleets of robots that act in a coordinated fashion to accomplish
assigned tasks. This can be achieved with algorithms for detection and
tracking, as well as formation control.</p>
<p>Getting robots to coordinate their activities poses another problem—they
must be able to communicate with one another. The speakers noted that this
problem may soon be solved with the advent of 5G networks.</p>
<p>“5G connections can deliver three key capabilities: enhanced mobile broadband
for high-quality and reliable data transfers, massive machine-type communications
to cater for more robots, and ultra-stable low-latency communication to
carry out real-time control,” said Mr Lim.</p>
<p>Will Skynet from the Terminator series develop from this confluence of
technologies? Only time will tell, but until then, it appears that a great
deal more research and development on robotics is necessary.</p>
