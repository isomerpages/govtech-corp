</p>
<p>Picture this: In the near future, borders will finally open again for
leisure travel. Upon arrival in the country where you‚Äôve booked a beach
holiday, the immigration officer pulls the records of your Covid-19 swab
test that you did in Singapore a day ago.</p>
<p>After noting the negative result, he checks another digital document indicating
you‚Äôre vaccinated. It takes just a few moments to ascertain that everything
is in order, and you sail through customs and head towards the sun and
sand!</p>
<p>Fantasies about vacations aside, such seamless verification of digital
documents is already a reality, thanks not only to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthcerts.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">technology</a>&nbsp;developed
by GovTech, but also the collaboration with private sector firms in putting
the technology into as many hands as possible.</p>
<p>Indeed, the public and private sectors are often discussed as separate
and even opposing forces where never the twain shall meet. In reality,
though, both sides regularly work together through public-private partnerships,
bringing their respective strengths to the table to achieve success in
a way that neither can do on its own.</p>
<h3>Confirm Plus Chop</h3>
<p>We use documents in our everyday lives as a seal of authenticity ‚Äì be
it a legal contract, an O-Level certificate, or a doctor‚Äôs MC. As such,
documents are useful only when;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>They can be verified and therefore trusted (your employer can ring up
the National University of Singapore (NUS) to check if you really graduated
from there)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are officially recognised by a large number of people (which is why
a NUS degree is worth much more than a degree you issue to yourself, for
example)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A revocation in place, if ever applicable, is made known explicitly (if
a degree is no longer valid due to unethical actions that transpired)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openattestation.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenAttestation (OA)</a>&nbsp;‚Äì
an open-source framework made by GovTech that can endorse and verify documents
using the blockchain, the same technology that powers cryptocurrency. Documents
issued through this framework are tamper-proof and are already used for
educational and vocational certificates (through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.opencerts.io/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCerts</a>&nbsp;product)
and maritime trade documents (through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TradeTrust</a>&nbsp;product),
says Barry Lim, a Delivery Manager with GovTech.</p>
<p>More recently, GovTech has also embarked on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthcerts.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HealthCerts</a>&nbsp;initiative,
which will authenticate pre-departure Covid test results and ensure the
safe resumption of international travel.</p>
<p>This tech solves the ‚Äúverifiable and trustworthy‚Äù aspect of the equation.
However, enough people need to use the OpenAttestation framework before
its potential can be realised. In the case of TradeTrust and HealthCerts,
the adoption must spread beyond Singapore. This is where private firms
‚Äì through public-private partnerships ‚Äì step in to drive the ‚Äúrecognised
by a large number of people‚Äù factor.</p>
<h3>Achieving Synergy</h3>
<p>Because OpenAttestation is open source, the private sector can incorporate
the tech into its products, driving usage outside the public sector.</p>
<p>For instance, GovTech and the Ministry of Health jointly released standards
and schema for digital documentation of pre-travel Covid test results through
HealthCerts.</p>
<p>Qualified private organisations then engaged medical facilities in and
outside Singapore to get them to start using HealthCerts too. The private
entities also reached out to airlines and immigration authorities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe common framework and open-source components avoid the need for private
organisations to reinvent the wheel, therefore achieving faster time to
market,‚Äù says Barry.</p>
<p>Indeed, private companies such as Accredify, AOKpass, and <a href="https://www.healthcerts.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trybe.ID</a> were
able to operate agilely beyond the shores of Singapore to amplify the reach
of HealthCerts. As a result, it now operates in nine countries and is used
by 420 medical facilities.</p>
<p>Another cross-border example is TradeTrust, which meets the criteria for
electronic trade documents stipulated by international trade law. This
frees up private firms from having to worry about compliance, allowing
them to focus on customising their apps to their clients‚Äô needs, differentiating
them from their competitors.</p>
<p>Open source helps to create a marketplace and transcend geographical boundaries
to fit the local context. We have also seen how some of these private entities,
such as <a href="https://www.healthcerts.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trybe.ID</a>,
customise users‚Äô needs using OA, such as the issuance of micro-credentials,
academic certificates or health certificates. Their contributions to the
OpenAttestation source code repository have also been incorporated during
the development of HealthCerts.</p>
<h3>Overcoming differences</h3>
<p>Of course, there are inevitable teething issues when organisations with
differing motivations come together. After all, the public sector is guided
by public policy, while private entities are profit-driven. This can lead
to different prioritisation of product roadmaps and extra effort must be
put in to understand the perspective of each side for smoother coordination.</p>
<p>Still, Barry feels that the benefits of public-private partnerships far
outweigh the downsides. Both parties share the belief in the potential
of technology to make lives better. That, he believes, is the secret sauce
that makes such collaborations work.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA common understanding on the benefits that can be brought about by the
tech in question will increase its adoption by correctly addressing the
user‚Äôs pain points‚Äù, he adds. Indeed, such efforts in place fosters innovation
and competitiveness. This approach to public-private partnership ensures
that we are not simply approaching the problem in a demand-and-supply manner
but rather working together to promote progressive solutions to a complex
situation.</p>
