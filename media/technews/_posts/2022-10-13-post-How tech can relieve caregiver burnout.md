<p>Being a caregiver can feel not only like a full<em>-</em>time job, but
even all-consuming of one’s life. There are daily commitments as another
person’s wellbeing depends on you; not to mention the emergencies to respond
to. Many caregivers are looking after their loved ones, so it is both physically
and emotionally demanding to see a person you’re close to in poor health.</p>

</p>
<p>Indeed, an August 2022&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/community/more-support-for-caregivers-after-major-study-finds-help-boosts-their-quality-of-life" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Straits Times article</a>&nbsp;reported
that over half of caregivers who took part in a survey said they were “burdened”
and “barely coping”.</p>
<p>As tech becomes increasingly important in society, it is also fortunately
providing some much needed support for caregivers. Here are five ways that
tech is relieving burnout among those caring for someone else.</p>
<h3>Dementia Friends app</h3>
<p>Sometimes, we just need to talk to and get together with others who are
in a similar situation and truly understand what we’re going through.</p>
<p>The Dementia Friends&nbsp;<a href="https://dementiafriendly.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">app</a>&nbsp;connects
caregivers of people with dementia. There are regular&nbsp;<a href="https://dementiafriendly.sg/Event" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">events</a>&nbsp;for
caregivers to share resources, provide support, and just lend a listening
ear. They can also turn to the app to submit a case if a loved one with
dementia is missing. The app’s 12,000 users will see the open cases and
can submit the location of recent sightings if they think they’ve spotted
the missing person.</p>
<p>There are also “safe-return” points where members of the public can take
lost people with dementia.</p>
<h3>Healthhub</h3>
<p>The Healthhub site provides a platform of resources for caregiving support
to learn more about costs and findings,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/costs-and-financing/22/caregivers-training-grant-ctg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">grants</a>,
find support&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/support-groups-and-others/3/caregiver_support_groups" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">groups</a>&nbsp;and
get caregiving tips. There are also resources on caregiver&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/support-groups-and-others/11/caregiver-training" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">training</a>&nbsp;and
self-care](<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/community/more-support-for-caregivers-after-major-study-finds-help-boosts-their-quality-of-life" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/support-groups-and-others/11/caregiver-training</a>).</p>
<p>There are also a host of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">e-services</a>&nbsp;where
caregivers can retrieve the health records of their loved ones, enabling
them to cut red tape when dealing with administrative matters.</p>
<p>They can also request for medication refills for repeat prescriptions
by logging in through Singpass and have the medicine delivered. This saves
the caregivers periodic trips to the clinic or hospital and saves them
precious time to catch a breather.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/community/more-support-for-caregivers-after-major-study-finds-help-boosts-their-quality-of-life" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mindline.sg</a>&nbsp;is
a site that provides tools and tips to manage your health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>One of the options you can choose is “I need caregiving support”. You’ll
be directed to various resources such as mindfulness exercises you can
do to feel better.</p>
<p>There is also an AI chatbot that performs different functions. For instance,
it can simply provide a listening ear should you have no one to talk to.
Or you can help you organise the tasks you have for the day and come up
with a plan for you.</p>
<h3>Telehealth/telemedicine</h3>
<p>One silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is discovering digital ways
to carry on with our day-to-day lives</p>
<p>Seeing a doctor was one of the tasks that seemed to be possible only in
person. But&nbsp;<a href="https://thehomeground.asia/destinations/singapore/the-impact-of-technology-on-caregiving-in-singapore/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">telehealth</a>,
or telemedicine, has risen in popularity in recent years. Through video
calls, the healthcare professional can assess the condition of the patient
and prescribe the necessary medicine and treatment.</p>
<p>Patients can get medical help from the comfort of their own homes and
save precious time and money that would otherwise be spent commuting to
and fro the medical facility. This also means the caregivers hopefully
have more time and resources for some self-care</p>
<h3>Rehabilitation robots</h3>
<p>For patients who have suffered conditions like stroke, brain and spinal
cord injuries, rehabilitation is key to them regaining control over their
bodies. Caregivers have to regularly assist patients in performing exercises,
tying them to a schedule and requiring significant physical exertion on
their parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ttsh.com.sg/About-TTSH/TTSH-News/Pages/Tan-Tock-Seng-Hospital-to-Bring-Innovative-Robotic-Rehabilitation-Closer-to-Patients.aspx" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Hospitals</a>&nbsp;in
Singapore have been using rehabilitative robots to aid patients in their
recovery and regain motor functions.</p>
<p>For instance, H-Man – a first-of-its-kind portal artificial intelligence
robot – helps stroke patients go through therapy for their upper limbs.
It has training exercises in the form of video games to engage the user
in improving their arm and hand strength and dexterity. It can also evaluate
patients’ performance and send feedback to therapists wirelessly.</p>
<p>There are also robots that assist patients in walking. Patients using
the Lokomat are strapped into a specially designed treadmill that can support
varying amounts of their body weight. This enables patients to intensify
their walking practice, going up to 1,000 steps within 30 minutes instead
of 100 steps in a conventional therapy session. Another advanced device
is the Ekso, a wearable exoskeleton. It uses programmable electric motors
to assist the legs to walk in a normal gait. Patients on Ekso can walk
longer distances with the help of just one therapist instead of several.</p>
<h3>Caregivers need self-care</h3>
<p>With Singapore’s rapidly ageing population, the number of people requiring
care will increase, meaning more people will be under pressure as caregivers.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, caregivers need their me-time and pay attention
for some self-care. Hopefully, as technology progresses, greater amounts
of load can be taken off them and be handled by machines and software instead.</p>
<p>It’s the least they deserve.</p>
