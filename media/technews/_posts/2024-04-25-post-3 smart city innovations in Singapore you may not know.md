<p>You‚Äôve probably heard of Singapore‚Äôs Smart Nation goal, but do you know
that the country was ranked as the smartest Asian city and seventh-smartest
in the world last year in the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-is-top-asian-city-in-smart-city-index-ranks-7th-worldwide" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Smart City Index</u></a>?
Indeed, the Republic has consistently made the top 10 in the index since
2019.</p>
<p>This recognition comes from tireless work from all aspects of the government
and close collaboration with the private sector. Here, we‚Äôre highlighting
three smart city innovations that you may not have heard of but nonetheless
put the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù in Smart Nation.</p>
<h3>1. Punggol Digital District</h3>
<p>Set to be launched progressively from 2024, the <a href="/media/technews/building-an-operating-system-for-punggol-digital-district/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Punggol Digital District</u></a> will
infuse technology into the way people live, work, and play within its 50
hectares.</p>
<p>For starters, facial recognition technology will be used for everything
from workplace access to unlocking bicycles at bike kiosks to paying for
purchases.</p>
<p>The new Singapore Institute of Technology‚Äôs campus will also be located
in Punggol, featuring fully connected buildings powered by the Internet
of Things and connected to a Multi-Energy Micro-Grid, which eliminates
carbon emissions equivalent to removing 2,000 vehicles from the roads.</p>
<p>Other features include car plate recognition technology so that parking
lots can be reserved through an app and smart lamp posts that detect the
proximity of people and dim and brighten accordingly.</p>
<p>All these are made possible by the <a href="/products-and-services/for-businesses/smart-city-tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Open Digital Platform</u></a>,
a smart city operating system that integrates various district management
operations onto a single platform. Using the platform, estate managers
can control the cooling system, pneumatic waste conveyance, autonomous
goods delivery, and security systems.</p>
<h3>2. Sensei Care Kit</h3>
<p>Singapore‚Äôs ageing population is a significant challenge that‚Äôs often
in the headlines, but less often discussed is the impact on caregivers
as an increasing number of elderly people need care.</p>
<p>The Sensei Care Kit aims to help caregivers by connecting various devices
measuring health metrics such as weight and blood pressure, thereby enabling
frictionless and comprehensive health monitoring of seniors at home.</p>
<p>Caregivers can even remotely monitor seniors‚Äô health, improving the odds
of early detection of issues that require closer attention. More frequent
health assessments also empower caregivers and the elderly with data to
make informed decisions.</p>
<h3>3. Personal Alert Button</h3>
<p>Another innovation that plays a significant role in managing Singapore‚Äôs
ageing population is the <a href="/products-and-services/for-citizens/smart-city-tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Personal Alert Button</u></a>.</p>
<p>The wireless device ‚Äì a simple box with a button ‚Äì can be placed anywhere
in a senior‚Äôs home. Upon activation, it will send a distress signal to
either a <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medical-and-care-facilities/8/senior_activity_centre" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Senior Activity Centre (SAC)</u></a> or
<a href="https://www.singhealth.com.sg/rhs/live-well/CareLine/about-us" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>CareLine</u>
</a>, a 24-hour telecare service provided by Changi General Hospital. The
PAB‚Äôs 4G technology enables communication with distressed seniors. A 10-second
recording can also be made by the senior to explain the situation.</p>
<p>From 2020 to 2023, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/alert-button-was-a-lifeline-for-67-year-old-who-fell-in-middle-of-night" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>around 800 seniors received</u></a> emergency
medical assistance through the alert system. As of mid-2023, the PAB has
been installed in about 8,600 units in 52 rental blocks, benefitting 10,000
seniors. The system will be expanded to all seniors aged 60 and above living
in public rental housing, helping about 27,000 more seniors living in about
170 rental blocks.</p>
<h3>Smart Nation is a home for all</h3>
<p>Above all, a Smart Nation is about using tech to improve the lives of
everyday Singaporeans.</p>
<p>The featured innovations benefit a myriad of residents, be it, seniors
who want to stay active and live independently, fitness enthusiasts looking
to take their physical training to the next level, or workers and students
who want to work and learn in a world-class tech environment, a <a href="/our-capabilities/smart-city-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>smart city</u></a> should
rightfully benefit everyone.</p>
<p>After all, Singapore is not just a city, it‚Äôs our home.</p>
