<p>The good news - everyone is onto agile development these days.</p>
<p>The bad news - many are onto agile development without knowing what it
fully entails or how to get the best out of it.</p>
<p>One of my biggest bugbears is the myth of delivering a faster, cheaper
and better outcome with agile development, and here is why.</p>
<h3>Origins of agile development</h3>
<p>The agile manifesto is well-known within the agile community. Many practices
in agile development are heavily influenced by ‚Äúlean manufacturing‚Äù.</p>
<p>Both methods adhere to a similar philosophy of waste reduction. However,
the two differ in execution primarily because ‚Äúlean manufacturing‚Äù produces
physical goods while ‚Äúagile development‚Äù produces digital products and
services.</p>
<p>By reducing waste, lean manufacturing produces higher-quality goods at
a lower cost. This begs the question, ‚ÄúIs agile development faster, cheaper
and delivers better outcomes through waste reduction?‚Äù</p>

<h3>The myth of faster, cheaper and better outcome</h3>
<p>Yes. It is. But, it is also easy to do agile development without waste
reduction.</p>
<p>This happens when the delivery team or agile project leader is inexperienced.
If this is the case, you should consider reading <a href="https://hackernoon.com/softwares-seven-deadly-wastes-8a88360d7027" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this</a> and
sending them for proper training.</p>
<p>In most situations, stakeholders or product owners don‚Äôt really understand
the implications of agile development. They believe that agile development
is something for the delivery team to adopt and execute, while they can
remain as status quo. Unfortunately, nothing can be further from the truth.</p>
<p>For agile development to be effective, stakeholders and product owners
have to reduce wastage by changing their behaviours and providing a conducive
environment for the delivery team. Otherwise, teams should stick with traditional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">waterfall development</a>.</p>
<p>Here are seven types of wastage teams should eliminate to maximise the
potential of agile development.</p>
<h3>Seven types of wastage teams need to eliminate in agile development</h3>
<h4>Wastage 1: Partially completed work (aka work-in-progress, WIP)</h4>
<p>WIP refers to detailed documentation, wire-frames and plans that are yet
to be implemented as codes. Until they have been implemented, these are
classified as WIP. WIP worsens task switching, waiting time and the possibility
of rework. Unfortunately, human craves certainty and planning gives assurance.
Some stakeholders and product owners require more assurance than others.
WIP is an unavoidable evil, so strive to keep it low. The amount of waste
you can reduce depends on the risk appetite of your stakeholders.</p>
<h4>Wastage 2: Over processing</h4>
<p>Do not spend too much time on refining proxies such as plans, documentation
and wire-frames. Unfortunately, when organisations are structured as functional
groups, functional specialists tend to over process because they are appraised
by their ability to do so. Planners are evaluated by their detailed and
exhaustive plans, business analysts are measured by the thoroughness of
their requirement documentation, and designers are‚Ä¶ you get the idea.</p>
<p>The agile delivery team will not be able to eliminate this systemic waste.
It requires organisational restructuring by the senior management to align
rewards and incentives throughout the organisation. Mission or task focused
teams should be prioritised over function-centric teams.</p>
<h4>Wastage 3: Task switching</h4>
<p>Another unintended consequence of having functional groups is the tendency
to assign each functional specialist to multiple projects.</p>
<p>Digital delivery activities are highly abstract and require creativity.
Switching across tasks incur waste due to context-switching. It costs about
15 minutes to interrupt and resume a task.</p>
<p>Another common reason for task switching is meetings. If you must have
meetings, always move them to the beginning or end of the day to minimise
waste to the entire team.</p>
<h4>Wastage 4: Waiting time</h4>
<p>Waiting time can be disproportionately high when teams are distributed
across different time-zones or physical locations.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where a team needs the product owner to clarify user
stories and validate their work only when it‚Äôs fully completed. This impedes
the team‚Äôs ability to get quick feedback from the product owner during
reviews. No or slow feedback leads to little or no improvements. This,
in turn, leads to persistent defects and repeated reworks.</p>
<h4>Wastage 5: Defects (rework)</h4>
<p>Defects lead to more defects. The longer it takes to detect defects, the
more wastage will be incurred on reworking and rectifying the defects.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a possible solution: shorten the feedback loop and rectify it early.
Daily stand-up meetings, sprint reviews and retrospective sessions are
the best avenues to obtain feedback, rectify defects and drive improvements.
Unfortunately, these sessions are often underutilised. An agile team requires
a safe environment to share critical and constructive feedback. The product
owner must participate to co-create this safe space.</p>
<h4>Wastage 6: Hand-offs</h4>
<p>Every time a deliverable or a project is handed off across roles, wastage
happens. Tacit knowledge is often lost in the process of handing off. This
leads to more delays and defects. It is foolish to incur the ‚Äúhanding off‚Äù
cost in favour of higher utilisation of people.</p>
<h4>Wastage 7: Overproduction</h4>
<p>Overproduction or developing features that are not needed by the users
is the final type of wastage. The best way to prevent overproduction is
to build the smallest possible feature or product (MVP) and validate it
before building a bigger and better version.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, overproduction often happens because of <a href="https://medium.com/producthood/the-arrogance-of-building-a-perfect-product-25c4dd26ab41" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">product arrogance</a>.
Product owners and other stakeholders are often overly certain of their
ideas and hypotheses and choose to skip the MVP to invest in a full-blown
product.</p>
<p>Of all the wastage, overproduction is the worst because it exacerbates
all other forms of wastage.</p>
<p>Agile development makes these wastages visible so that product owners
and stakeholders can eliminate them. Otherwise, it is just another fancy
idea that produces more noise than substance.</p>
