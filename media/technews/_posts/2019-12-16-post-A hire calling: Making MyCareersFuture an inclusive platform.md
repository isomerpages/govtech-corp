<h3>Persons with disabilities may have difficulty navigating the <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a> portal to find employment. Mr Dickson Tan, software engineer at GovTech, is helping to change that.</h3>
<p>Gone are the days when job hunting involved flipping through the classified
ads in the newspapers. In the internet age, employers have moved their
talent search online to gain access to a bigger, global pool of candidates,
and employees have more choices when scouting for positions posted on job
portals.</p>
<p>One such portal is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a>&nbsp;platform,
developed by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), which
serves as a digital one-stop repository and resource centre for hirers
and job seekers. From creating job alerts to ranking job applicants by
suitability, both sides of the recruitment fence stand to gain from the
new features of the government-hosted job-matching site.</p>
<p>However, simply moving hiring processes online is not enough‚Äîthe inclusivity
of job portals ought to be taken into consideration as well. For example,
people with partial or total loss of vision will have difficulty navigating
an online job portal. GovTech thus recognises that greater effort needs
to be put into augmenting the very fabric of a web page to make it fully
accessible to all individuals.</p>
<h3>Key improvements in accessibility</h3>
<p>One of the ways to navigate a web page is to mouse over icons and click
on them. This still requires one to watch where the cursor goes, an interface
that could be difficult for someone with vision loss. For others with limited
upper limb mobility, the fine motor control required to use a mouse may
also impede web page access.</p>
<p>To solve these problems, the <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a> team at GovTech
endeavoured to make every corner of the job portal accessible by keyboard.
‚ÄúAll our search filters, including the trees for selecting government support
schemes and location filters, are now completely operable via the keyboard‚Äîthey
can be reached via tab navigation. The arrow keys move through options,
and the spacebar toggles selection,‚Äù said Mr Dickson Tan, a software engineer
at GovTech.</p>
<p>In addition, the user account menu that previously only appeared when
a mouse cursor was hovering over it can now be called up at the stroke
of a key. Various instances of links or buttons that could only be activated
via the computer mouse are now keyboard operable too, Mr Tan quipped, adding
that it was just as important to make sure that everything displayed on
the page was compatible with screen readers - a form of assitive technology
to help people with visual impairement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor example, we‚Äôve fixed the skills input function. Before we patched
it, screen readers did not read the skills correctly and were difficult
to select or deselect,‚Äù Mr Tan explained.</p>

<h3>Championing ability and inclusiveness</h3>
<p>These accessibility tools implemented by Mr Tan came from a deeply personal
place‚Äîhe is legally blind and has experienced first-hand some of the difficulties
in job hunting, be it online or offline. Notably, the enhanced keyboard-based
user interface benefits not only those who are visually impaired or who
have limited dexterity but is also useful for ‚Äúanyone who is eating with
their ‚Äòmouse hand‚Äô while on a computer.‚Äù In other words, accessibility
options tend to serve a wider group than their originally intended audience,
which is why Mr Tan is motivated to do what he does.</p>
<p>During a sharing session at The Enabling Village located in Redhill, Singapore,
Mr Tan spoke about how certain employment practices can discriminate against
persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the tech sector, it‚Äôs pretty common for employers to conduct an online
pre-interview test to screen for technical competency,‚Äù he said. However,
some of the tests may include screenshots of programming language. As a
result, screen readers would not be able to read out the code to him, putting
him at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>To ensure a more level playing field for job applicants, employers can
avoid the use of such screenshots in tests, and if the test is to be conducted
at the organisation itself, test terminals ought to have open-source screen
reader software installed.</p>
<p>Accommodations at the workplace can also facilitate productivity and seamless
cooperation between people with visual impairment and their colleagues.
Illustrating this point, Mr Tan highlighted that GovTech had enabled a
screen reader tool that allows two people to edit code from two different
workstations at the same time. This makes collaboration more convenient
for him since he can rely on his workstation‚Äôs screen reader to quickly
understand what his colleague is doing rather than have his colleague constantly
verbalise code changes to him.</p>
<p>Hence, with better accessibility on job portals, the right hiring practices,
appropriate workplace accommodations and inclusive organisational culture,
employers can attract diverse talents to fill their ranks, Mr Tan concluded.</p>
