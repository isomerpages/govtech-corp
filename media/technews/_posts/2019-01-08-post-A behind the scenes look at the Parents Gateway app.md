<p>TL:DR: Officially launched on 2 January 2019, the Parents Gateway mobile
app serves as a one-stop platform for schools and parents to connect online.
The idea of a centralised digital service was conceptualised by Mr Melvyn
Song, executive application consultant at GovTech. Learn more about his
journey to bring Parents Gateway from dream to reality.</p>
<hr>
<p>Children aren‚Äôt the only ones who feel excited about a new school semester;
their parents arguably experience equal anxiety each time the school bells
signal the end of the term break.</p>
<p>From keeping track of a range of academic and extracurricular activities
to granting consent for school excursions, walking the journey alongside
a school-going kid is certainly exciting.</p>
<p>Whereas in the past, phone calls, forms and face-to-face meetings served
as the main channels of communication between teachers and parents, digitalisation
is empowering schools to engage parents more effectively, while cutting
down on administrative gridlock on teachers.</p>
<p>Embodying these ideals of digital transformation in education is the Parents
Gateway, which serves as a one-stop platform for schools to connect with
parents on key administrative matters.</p>
<p>Co-developed with the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Parents Gateway
app is driven by Mr Melvyn Song, executive application consultant at the
Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech).</p>
<p>He gestated the idea of the app and brought it from ambition to reality.
TechNews spoke to Mr Song about the labour of love that resulted in a platform
that will eventually serve 600,000 parents and 33,000 teachers across Singapore.</p>
<h3>Phase 1: From personal pain points to a prototype</h3>
<p>Being a father of three himself, Mr Song is no stranger to the difficulties
faced by working adults with school-going children. But what motivated
him to create Parents Gateway was the numerous paper documents and forms
he kept receiving from his children‚Äôs teachers when they were younger.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere were so many [documents] that I started to misplace some of them!
At times, I even found some of these forms magnetised on my fridge (usually
past their due dates),‚Äù he said with a laugh.</p>
<p>He was quick to see the value of having a centralised portal for parents
and schools to interact digitally. It will reduce or remove the need for
paper-based correspondence. Eagerly, he began working on prototypes, coding
in various functions that he felt would be useful for teachers and parents.</p>
<p>Within a fortnight, a rudimentary version of Parents Gateway was ready‚Äîone
that would allow schools to send notifications to parents online and let
parents grant permission for their child to take part in certain school
activities.</p>

<h3>Phase 2: Refining the solution</h3>
<p>‚ÄúTowards the end of 2016 there began a push towards digitalisation within
the government agencies, including MOE,‚Äù Mr Song noted, adding that schools
at the time were also starting to focus on streamlining processes and freeing
up more time for educators to focus on teaching and learning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe started iterating prototypes and wireframes to help various stakeholders
appreciate the vision of Parents Gateway. With the support of the management
[at MOE] and the Digital Services Accelerator Programme, the stars were
aligned.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mr Song went on to build a team that would help realise the vision for
Parents Gateway. In addition to software developers and business analysts,
the team was augmented with MOE education officers who formed an integral
part of the project.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThey [MOE officers] have the relevant experience and knowledge of processes
in schools, so we were able to bounce ideas off them quickly, then design
the application based on their recommendations. This helped to cut down
the number of rounds of iterations which otherwise would require more time
interacting with schools,‚Äù he explained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team also did extensive research, consulting over 1,200 teachers and
at least 2,000 parents to understand their needs. ‚ÄúWhen we build a feature
or change something in Parents Gateway, it impacts more than 300 schools
and 600,000 parents, so we need to take a practical and conscious approach.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Phase 3: Making incremental advances with feedback</h3>
<p>By January 2018, Mr Song‚Äôs team was ready to field test a viable version
of Parents Gateway. Ten schools were enrolled during the alpha phase which
ended in October 2018.</p>
<p>Mr Song hopes that Parents Gateway can help to reduce administrative workload
by at least 30 minutes per teacher per week, and that parents can have
a positive experience using the app.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIdeally, the app will help to reduce the angst around administrative
paperwork for both parents and teachers. This is only the beginning. Depending
on the feedback we receive, we will implement more features frequently
to meet other needs,‚Äù he added.</p>
<p>Going forward, the team plans to use Parents Gateway to share information
and resources to provide greater support for parents when their children
are choosing schools or preparing for exams.</p>

<h3>Personal Development</h3>
<p>Like a proud parent, Mr Song gets emotional whenever he sees parents using
the app in malls or at hawker centres.</p>
<p>This project has also benefited Mr Song‚Äôs personal development and he
is grateful for the support and opportunities given to lead and drive it.</p>
<p>He had to adjust his leadership style and mindset from relying on outcome-based
management to one that looks at team optimisation. Managing multiple stakeholders
and appreciating diversity is also part and parcel of his job now.</p>
<p>In the new year, Mr Song hopes to see more public officers taking ownership
of what they care for and start to ‚Äúthink bigger, fail faster, and learn
quicker‚Äù to create better digital services for Singapore.</p>
