<h2>Exclusive Feature on Lillian Shieh: Keynote Speaker at STACK 2024</h2>
<p>One of eight established keynote speakers at <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/communities/events/conferences/stack-developer-conference-2024/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STACK Developer Conference 2024</a>,
Lillian has a wealth of experience in user research, design, and product
strategy. In addition to being the Senior Director and Head of Design in
Asia Pacific previously at Johnson &amp; Johnson, she was also awarded
the prestigious <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/careers/opportunities-for-professionals/smart-nation-fellowship-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation Fellowship</a> at
GovTech.</p>
<p>As the new Head of Design at GovTech, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lillianshieh/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lillian</a> will work on
improving GovTech’s product development process and <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">digital products</a> for
citizens, businesses and public officers.</p>
<p>In this exclusive article, Lillian will share some of her valuable thoughts
and opinions in response to the questions about her career experiences,
and expertise in the design field.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<h3>As a design researcher, product strategist, and UX designer, you have extensive experience and knowledge in the field of design and UX. Could you share about how you got into this industry and why you enjoy working in this field?</h3>
<p>I worked as a design researcher for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Lab" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">E-Lab</a>, a consultancy that
pioneered social science methods for product development. UX entered the
picture because E-Lab was acquired by a digital consultancy to do “Experience
Modelling.” As part of XMod, I discovered that some of the most interesting
product challenges are designing experiences for high-trust domains like
banking, travel, and government.</p>
<p><em>[Note: E-Lab was renamed as XMod when E-Lab was acquired by <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Publicis Sapient</a></em>—<em>a technology consulting firm</em>—<em>in 1999.]</em>

<h3>What are some common misconceptions about UX designers that you have come across in your line of work/past experiences?</h3>
<p>A common misconception about Design is that it’s only a delivery function
for visuals. Good design operates at the systems level and is integral
to HOW something works well.</p>
<p>Why is design thinking important for innovation in an organisation?</p>
<p><strong>Business analysis</strong> and <strong>strategy</strong> are not
foolproof, because their starting point is often based on incorrect assumptions
about people’s needs.&nbsp; <strong>Design Thinking</strong> provides a framework
for developing insight and identifying important problems to be solved.</p>
