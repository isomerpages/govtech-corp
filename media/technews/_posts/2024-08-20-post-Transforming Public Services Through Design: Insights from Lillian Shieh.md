<h2>Exclusive feature on Lillian Shieh: Keynote speaker at STACK 2024</h2>
<p>One of eight established keynote speakers at <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/communities/events/conferences/stack-developer-conference-2024/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STACK Developer Conference 2024</a>,
Lillian has a wealth of experience in user research, design, and product
strategy. In addition to being the Senior Director and Head of Design in
Asia Pacific previously at Johnson &amp; Johnson, she was also awarded
the prestigious <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/careers/opportunities-for-professionals/smart-nation-fellowship-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation Fellowship</a> at
GovTech.</p>
<p>As the new Head of Design at GovTech, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lillianshieh/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lillian</a> will work on
improving GovTech’s product development process and <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">digital products</a> for
citizens, businesses and public officers.</p>
<p>In this exclusive article, Lillian will share some of her valuable thoughts
and opinions in response to the questions about her career experiences,
and expertise in the design field.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<h3>As a design researcher, product strategist, and UX designer, you have extensive experience and knowledge in the field of design and UX. Could you share about how you got into this industry and why you enjoy working in this field?</h3>
<p>I worked as a design researcher for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Lab" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">E-Lab</a>, a consultancy that
pioneered social science methods for product development. UX entered the
picture because E-Lab was acquired by a digital consultancy to do “Experience
Modelling.” As part of XMod, I discovered that some of the most interesting
product challenges are designing experiences for high-trust domains like
banking, travel, and government.</p>
<p><em>[Note: E-Lab was renamed as XMod when E-Lab was acquired by <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Publicis Sapient </a></em>— <em>a technology consulting firm </em>— <em>in 1999.]</em>
</p>
<h3>What are some of your proudest achievements in your design career?</h3>

<h3>What are some common misconceptions about UX designers that you have come across in your line of work/past experiences?</h3>
<p>A common misconception about Design is that it’s only a delivery function
for visuals. Good design operates at the systems level and is integral
to HOW something works well.</p>
<h3>Why is design thinking important for innovation in an organisation?</h3>
<p><strong>Business analysis</strong> and <strong>strategy</strong> are not
foolproof, because their starting point is often based on incorrect assumptions
about people’s needs.&nbsp;<strong>Design Thinking</strong> provides a framework
for developing insight and identifying important problems to be solved.</p>
<h3>Based on your experience, what are some important tips for good UX design in mobile applications/e-services?</h3>
<p>Counterintuitively, when developing mobile apps, product teams should
invest time appropriately. Mobile apps can be harder to build than websites
because they must target problems more accurately. The most successful
apps are designed with a balance of <strong>simplicity, clarity, and functionality</strong>.
A great designer understands that within any app there are hundreds of
potential features and routes, but makes thoughtful choices to build user
flows that are <strong>most effective</strong> and <strong>naturally intuitive</strong>.</p>
<h3>Any advice on best practices when testing with users?</h3>
<p>Scope properly for testing (and user research) and know that this will
save downstream time and effort.</p>
<h3>With advancements in Generative AI, how do you see this fast-growing technology impacting UX designers and how can they better prepare themselves for the future of design?</h3>
<p>Like many other professions, we will rebuild our workflows to incorporate
AI where it makes work more efficient. Designers will focus on understanding
people and context to build product strategy and complex solutions comprising
people, ideas, processes and systems.</p>
<p>To strengthen their strategic capabilities, designers will become experts
in systems thinking while also deepening their education in the technology
of the solutions they build, and the language and priorities of their domain,
e.g. healthcare, business, government, etc.</p>
<h3>What inspires you? / What does a good day at work for you look like?</h3>
<p>What do I love? Working with open-minded, curious people, who are kind,
professional, and driven by purpose to solve big problems.</p>
<p>What I enjoy at work includes questioning and examining problems from
first principles, as well as diverging to experiment with ideas, then converging
to shape those ideas into great work that delivers impact.</p>
<h3>As the newly onboarded Head of Design at GovTech, what are some things you are excited to start working on?</h3>
<p>A few of the questions and problems I’m excited to tackle:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How does design work in GovTech’s product development process?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we ensure that design is set up for success, including investing
in the growth of our designers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Design work together with Technology and Product Management to
ensure quality and impact of government digital services? How do we build
healthy team collaboration at scale?&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we partner with agencies to ensure that services are deeply user-centric,
while integrating best practices for building usable, accessible, government
digital services?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Lillian’s keynote address at STACK 2024 will cover insights into how government
services can be improved, how impactful biases are developed in digital
services, and the importance of digital maturity on changing priorities
of government digital services.</p>
