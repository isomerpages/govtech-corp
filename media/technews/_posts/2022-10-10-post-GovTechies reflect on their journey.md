<p>It‚Äôs GovTech‚Äôs 6th birthday! In the past six years, there have been countless
projects that have touched different facets of society. These initiatives
were only made possible by our extraordinary GovTechies who embody our
ABC values ‚Äì Agile, Bold, Collaborative.</p>
<p>To mark the milestone of our sixth birthday, we spoke to some GovTechies
on the impact of their work and what keeps them going.</p>

<h3>Why did you become part of the A11Y (a term for accessibility ‚Äì there are 11 letters between ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúy‚Äù in the word) movement?</h3>
<p>Kim: I‚Äôve always had this inclination to use my strengths and skills for
public good. Throughout my career, I was constantly pulled towards work
or personal projects within the inclusion space and as I picked up tech
along the way, working in digital accessibility felt like a natural progression.
We spend at least eight hours of our day working, so ensuring that these
hours go towards purposeful and fulfilling causes is important to me.</p>
<p>Royce: I‚Äôve always wanted to contribute to society and have volunteered
with the Singapore Association for the Deaf (SADEAF) and the Make-A-Wish
Foundation since my university days. However, my volunteer work was always
on an ad-hoc basis. When this A11Y opportunity came up, it caught my attention.
I can finally apply my technical knowledge to contribute to causes close
to my heart.</p>
<h3>What do you enjoy about your work at GovTech?</h3>
<p>Kim: It has to be the people and the learning culture. My team members
are very encouraging about my appetite for growth and support me by providing
learning opportunities as well as advising me on other avenues for upskilling
such as mentorship programmes and The Digital Academy.</p>
<p>Royce: Definitely, the job satisfaction comes from working on meaningful
projects. I wake up every day looking forward to spending a great day at
work instead of counting down to the weekend. We are also in the best position
to implement positive change to help citizens through technology. What
are some tips you have for anyone who wants to be more inclusive in their
everyday life?</p>
<p>Kim: Make an effort to be around people from the community. Volunteer,
engage in conversations, have an open mind and don‚Äôt be afraid to unlearn
some behaviours. The main gap that I‚Äôm hoping to reduce here is the lived
experience, and you can‚Äôt fully understand that without practising empathy.</p>
<p>Royce: See the person, not the disability. You can do so by engaging with
the PwD community through volunteering. This helps to develop empathy and
you will also get to appreciate the accessibility features around you.</p>

</div>
<h3>What are three traits that you think are necessary to do your job well?</h3>
<p>Firstly, empathy. We have to walk in others‚Äô shoes to understand their
pain points and think of workarounds to improve the situation. Secondly,
tactical agility. We have to be creative when drafting contract requirements
to achieve better pricing and efficiency during contract management.</p>
<p>Thirdly, resilience. Project teams are usually not familiar with procurement
rules and processes. We must have the resilience to manage difficult situations
and complete each procurement with a positive experience for all. What
motivates you to go above and beyond at your job?</p>
<p>I am motivated by the trust and support received from project teams and
hope to turn each procurement exercise into a happy experience. Over time,
I have also benefited from improved competence and knowledge beyond my
role. Why do you think it‚Äôs important for GovTechies to help one another
and be team players?</p>
<p>As a public agency, many of our projects require cross-division or agency
collaboration. Project success can only be achieved when the different
stakeholders come together, leverage on our respective strengths to solve
problems and move towards a common goal.</p>

<h3>Why is GovTech‚Äôs Digtal4Good (D4G) a meaningful project?</h3>
<p>Digital4Good builds people‚Äôs confidence in the digital society so that
everyone can benefit from digitisation. The programme also inspires GovTechies
to volunteer and make direct contributions to society.</p>
<p>Is there a particular moment that stands out for you during the past D4Gs?</p>
<p>In a recent session at the Digital Learning Circle workshop, a senior
citizen was so delighted to discover that she could use Google Translator
to read the food label in the language she is comfortable with. Now, grocery
shopping is so much more enjoyable for her.</p>
<h3>What keeps you so passionate about D4G?</h3>
<p>Leading a team of GovTech volunteers has boosted my leadership skills
and got me closer to the community. We can better understand their pain
points and know how we can help them so that nobody is left behind in our
digital society.</p>

</div>
<h3>What keeps you motivated to push your limits?</h3>
<p>In the information security space, continual upskilling is necessary to
keep up with rapid changes in technology. Malicious actors are abusing
new vulnerabilities and entire classes of exploits around the clock, so
falling behind can lead to a critical business impact on our operations
and data leaks.</p>
<h3>What are you currently learning or planning to learn next?</h3>
<p>I am currently learning cloud infrastructure and service exploitation.
I am also keeping an eye on emerging technologies like blockchain security.</p>
<h3>How has GovTech supported your journey?</h3>
<p>My leaders constantly challenge me to push my boundaries by sharing new
materials, writeups, and courses. They also imparted skills that are not
easily acquired from the internet. I am grateful for the support!</p>

</div>
<h3>Why were you drawn to this cause?</h3>
<p>Sowmya: I have been in meeting rooms where I was the only woman. Gender
balance brings positive changes to what we talk about and how we talk,
and I have experienced that first-hand. I want to add my voice to this
cause!</p>
<p>Liyana: Being part of the WiG ERG came naturally to me as I have been
an advocate for women-in-tech issues outside of work. I am inspired to
use my position well at GovTech to create a safe space for women to explore
careers in tech and enable them to design what success looks like for themselves.</p>
<h3>How has the WiG ERG been advocating and educating GovTechies on the importance of gender balance?</h3>
<p>We do it through a mix of community and educational events.</p>
<p>One of our bigger initiatives is the Girls in Tech Summer Mentorship Programme.
Due to the enthusiastic response last year from university students, we
expanded the programme to students from junior colleges and polytechnics.
We were heartened to see that our pool of participants grew, which shows
that more GovTechies are supportive of our cause and that more young women
are encouraged to explore a STEM career.</p>
<h3>What achievements of WiG ERG are you proud of?</h3>
<p>When we were recognised in the 2021 GovTech Impact Awards. It‚Äôs encouraging
to know that our colleagues in GovTech are receptive to our efforts to
drive active conversations around being more gender inclusive and neutral
in the organisation, which will ultimately influence the wider tech industry.</p>
