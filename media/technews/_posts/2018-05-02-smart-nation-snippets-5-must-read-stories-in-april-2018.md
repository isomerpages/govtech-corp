A self-aware Smart Nation recognises that it can’t achieve its aims unilaterally. In Singapore, grants and platforms enable companies, research institutions and government agencies to work together, sharing challenges and technologies to speed up and scale innovative solutions. The country is indeed adding to its array of citizen services, with a new online legal help centre that augments the support needy litigants receive. 

At the same time, corporate leaders in Singapore and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific still lag behind in digital readiness, says a new report from human resources firm Korn Ferry. To adapt to a digital future, business leaders must display traits such as curiosity and risk-taking to a greater degree, the report found. Read about these issues and more in this month’s Smart Nation Snippets.

### **Are Asia-Pacific leaders still lagging in digital readiness?**

To succeed in the digital realm, CEOs and other leaders must be more comfortable with ambiguity and display more curiosity, confidence and adaptability, the report said.
