<p>Are you someone who always has opinions on the latest trending news and
topics? Or are you the type of diner who leaves an online review after
visiting a restaurant? Do you often leave tips and recommendations on travel
sites after an overseas trip?</p>
<p>If you love benefitting and contributing to the wisdom of the crowd or
sharing your views about government policies, then you‚Äôll love CrowdTaskSG
‚Äì a newly launched crowdsourcing web portal to tap the collective intelligence
of Singaporeans.</p>
<h3>What‚Äôs CrowdTaskSG?</h3>
<p>On CrowdTaskSG, you‚Äôll find various opportunities to share your opinions
and feedback with government agencies.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You can participate in different tasks, such as surveys on topics related
to government policies and national identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might even find tasks to test out prototype products, such as new
government websites to give your feedback about areas of improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform is a one-stop shop, consolidating tasks from the whole of
government and allowing interested people to easily access them.</p>
<p>All Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents aged 18 years and above
are able to access the portal with their Singpass account.</p>
<h3>How can I benefit from this?</h3>
<p>Apart from having your opinions heard, the process itself is designed
to be fun.</p>
<p>We aim to be as entertaining as your favourite online games. You can earn
virtual Coins when you complete tasks on CrowdTaskSG and exchange them
for incentives in the real world ‚Äì vouchers, for instance.</p>

<h3>It‚Äôs all about co-creation</h3>
<p>Recognising that Singaporeans are ultimately the end-users of government
services, the agencies have been involving the public early in the workflow
of product or policy creation so that their input is taken into account
from the start. Citizens are really co-creators!</p>
<p>The current landscape of crowdsourcing may be perceived as fragmented,
making it difficult for Singaporeans to get an overview of all the opportunities
out there while agencies have a hard time finding the right target participants.</p>
<p>CrowdTaskSG solves the issues on both sides, with all government crowdsourcing
tasks on one site.</p>
<p>Agencies can also make use of the targeted assignment feature to reach
their target demographic. For example, they can easily screen for older
volunteers if they want to test how user-friendly a product is for elderly
users.</p>
<p>The CrowdTaskSG team is also looking to include more variety of tasks,
including polls and A/B testing, and is reaching out to the various agencies
to hear how the platform can better support their crowdsourcing efforts.</p>
<h3>You can be a contributor too</h3>
<p>GovTech is all about improving the lives of everyone through technology.
The fundamental mindset shift powering CrowdTaskSG is that Singaporeans
are not just beneficiaries, but can be significant contributors as well.</p>
<p>So, join us as we leverage citizens‚Äô expertise to solve problems. Who
knows, your input and insight might just end up being the killer feature
of the government‚Äôs next digital product.</p>
