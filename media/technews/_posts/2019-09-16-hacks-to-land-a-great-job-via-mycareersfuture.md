Everybody wants to land their dream job and build a career in the profession of their choice. To help matchmake citizens with their ideal roles in companies, Workforce Singapore, in collaboration with the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), has launched MyCareersFuture.sg —a one-stop portal for job hunting, hiring, career advice and industry insights

We spoke to two GovTechies from the MyCareersFuture.sg team, Barry Lim and Yvonne Chia who worked on the portal and found insider tips for jobseekers looking to increase their visibility on MyCareersFuture.sg. For employers, read on to find out how you can use the portal to find that elusive but exceptional candidate to fill a position.

### **For jobseekers**

**1. Add skills to improve your job search**
 
While educational qualifications are important in the modern economy, companies are placing greater emphasis on skills when evaluating whether a candidate is suitable for a particular position. Typically, an organisation inputs to the MyCareersFuture.sg portal a list of skills that it deems valuable to its operations. An algorithm on MyCareersFuture.sg will then scour the applicant database for individuals who have indicated the relevant skills. It goes without saying, then, that you ought to flaunt your skills when creating your profile on MyCareersFuture.sg.
 
Here’s how:
 - Start a search on MyCareersFuture.sg
 - Click on the ‘Add Skills’ button
 - Identify skills that you have, and click to add
 - Login with SingPass to save the skills to your profile

The more thorough you are in highlighting your capabilities, the more job opportunities can possibly be made available to you. However, also take note that the skills you add are appropriate to the kinds of jobs you are applying for as the algorithm will sort candidates based on how well they match the job.
 
**2. Create job alerts to get notified of relevant jobs**
 
Once you’ve created your profile, you’re all set to start job hunting! Simply start by searching for your desired job. Alternatively, you can explore jobs that are popular or in demand.

Timing matters in a job search, and sometimes your ideal position just isn’t available yet. Fret not—the MyCareersFuture.sg portal allows you to create a job alert based on your search term and filters.
 
Here’s how:

This means that you will be automatically notified if there are new job postings that match your preferences. The database of job postings is refreshed daily, so the moment a good match is found, you can pounce on the opportunity and send in your application.
 
**3. Use government support filters for an added boost**
 
Maybe you’ve been looking for a job for six months or more. Or perhaps you’re looking to explore a new field but have no prior experience in it. Good news, we are here to help increase your chances of landing your next job.
 
Here’s what you need to do:
 - Click on ‘Search jobs with government support’ on the main page.

Browse through job postings eligible for government support. For example, if you see ‘Government support for individuals between jobs’ next to the job posting, it means that the government will provide wage subsidies to companies for hiring experienced individuals under the Career Support Programme.

### **For employers**

### **1. Use the ‘Top Matches’ checkbox**
 
Let’s face it—hiring managers are flooded with job applications every day, not all of which are relevant to the position being advertised. MyCareersFuture.sg can help you cut through the noise with its ‘Top Matches’ function. With just a click of a button, you’ll be able to quickly view the top matches as assessed by the platform’s two job matching partners—WCC and JobKred. For even better results, employers should include in their job postings the skills they expect their prospective hires to have. This helps close the loop with the skills information volunteered by jobseekers while raising the visibility of the job posting.

### **2. Rank applicants by suitability**
 
Instead of sorting candidates based on the date they submitted their applications, employers can now categorise candidates according to their suitability to job postings on MyCareersFuture.sg. An algorithm automatically sieves through candidate profiles for their skills, work experience and education and ranks candidates to facilitate the hiring decision. 
 
### **3. Discover hidden talents**
 
Sometimes, experienced and competent individuals may not be actively looking for a career transition, but they remain open to job offers and opportunities. Companies that are looking to hire opportunistically or urgently can view suggested talents who have been assessed to be a good fit based on how closely they matched the job.
