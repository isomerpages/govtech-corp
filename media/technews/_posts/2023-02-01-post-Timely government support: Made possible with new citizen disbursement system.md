</p>
<p>In recent months, you might have heard of or even benefited from the many
Government support schemes being rolled out. These include the GST Voucher,
the Assurance Package and various Special Payments, which ultimately help
Singaporeans cope with daily living and are an important part of our social
security system.</p>
<p>As the implementing agency of these government schemes, the Central Provident
Fund Board (CPFB) has been called on more frequently to provide timely
and accurate support to citizens. To this end, CPFB joined forces with
GovTech to modernise its IT system, developing a new Citizen Disbursement
IT System (‚ÄúCDIT‚Äù), which flexibly caters to varying scheme criteria and
grant disbursement amounts. GovTech provided expertise and support in design,
engineering and agile practices, which helped CPFB with the harmonisation
of existing business processes to enhance the speed of grant disbursement
to citizens. Phase 1 of the system was rolled out to support the 2022 GST
Voucher, Cost of Living Special Payment and Assurance Package 2023, disbursing
a total of $3.1 billion in grants to up to 2.9 million individuals over
five schemes.</p>
<h3>What does the Citizen Disbursement IT System do?</h3>
<p>The CDIT consolidates common microservices needed for most schemes through
a common code base and architecture, which is designed to be reusable,
scalable and user-configurable with less IT involvement. Imagine the CDIT
as a new drink vending machine that can churn out your favourite drink
at the push of a button within seconds, as opposed to having to make your
way to your chosen stall, queue to order and wait while the vendor prepares
the order.</p>
<p>Tseng Wei Haur, a product owner at CPFB, shared that, as a system built
on cloud-based microservices, CDIT can tap on tools such as Amazon Web
Services‚Äô Data Migration Service (DMS), which might not be easily available
on traditional on-premise systems. This enables close to real-time data
replication between microservices which, as there is no need to coordinate
file transfer scheduling and lower dependency risk compared to API calls.
He added: ‚ÄúThis provides the project teams with a wider suite of ready
options in designing systems, allowing for more suitable methods and greater
effectiveness.‚Äù</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the CDIT‚Äôs user-configurability will be extended to other
microservices to provide more seamless end-to-end solutions. For instance,
business users can have the flexibility to configure the sequence of payment
services along PayNow-NRIC, GIRO, and GovCash, enabling greater flexibility
in scheme implementation.</p>
<h3>What are the main benefits that the public will enjoy?</h3>
<p>With the new system, government schemes can be implemented faster, ensuring
uniform and consistent service to Singaporeans in a timely fashion. The
team estimates that the time taken for scheme deployment will be reduced
by almost three months compared to the past.</p>
<p>One major reason for the accelerated scheme setup is the CDIT‚Äôs user-configurable
means testing engine, the first of its kind within the Singapore government.
This empowers non-IT users to self-configure schemes and their criteria
and parameters on an intuitive user interface with minimal effort, as code
isn‚Äôt involved.</p>
<p>This is supported by a comprehensive data repository with up-to-date data
from Whole-of-Government Single Source of Truth (SSOTs) and Trusted Centres
(TC) to facilitate faster turnaround. The CDIT also automates case handling
for straightforward appeals and, more importantly, re-runs of scheme means-testing
and pre-empting appeals even before they come in.</p>
<p>Additionally, the reusability of the CDIT brings different schemes into
a single platform, harmonising scheme implementation. This means that for
every appeal that comes in, the system automatically looks across different
schemes, reassesses eligibility, computes delta amounts, and pays the eligible
citizen in one go. For citizens, this ensures a uniform service experience
that is streamlined with minimal gaps. For example, when there is a change
in one‚Äôs housing type, automatic reassessment will be applied across all
applicable schemes via the CDIT once the updated data is captured in the
common data repository.</p>
<p>The team is also working on speeding up the notification infrastructure
so that people can receive scheme updates quickly from trusted digital
channels, an important consideration with the prevalence of scams and information
circulation from dubious sources.</p>
<h3>Main challenges and key lessons</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in developing the CDIT was that it was a
new system with no comparables to take cues from. The project team had
to be the first movers in many areas and navigate uncharted territories.</p>
<p>CPFB scrum master Steven Ooi said the initial stages were difficult as
it was hard to measure if the project was going well. He shared: ‚ÄúTransformation
is not an easy journey. It always starts from within, and results may not
be noticeable at the onset. However, when it strikes you one day that things
are progressing well and the team is growing stronger, it is indeed validating
and rewarding.‚Äù</p>
<p>Another big challenge was the periodic need to reprioritise development
plans to support citizens through the pandemic and challenging macroeconomic
environment. As such, the project members learned to build usable, minimum-viable
products while keeping the end goal of providing Singaporeans with progressive
benefits in mind. ‚ÄúThink big, start small, and act fast,‚Äù as the team summarised
aptly. The team explored innovative solutions to work around recurrent
issues along the development process, such as Python scripts to consolidate
daily reports, reconcile records, and generate test accounts automatically.</p>
<p>The ongoing CDIT project requires close and strong collaboration between
the two government agencies. GovTech software engineer Chia Wei Kang noted
that both agencies collaborated well together to overcome obstacles. ‚ÄúThe
camaraderie between the colleagues from both CPFB and GovTech made this
learning journey fun and memorable. The journey has only just begun, and
I look forward to creating and building on new digital projects,‚Äù he said.</p>
<h3>A system that stands the test of time</h3>
<p>The demand for government social transfers will continue to evolve with
changing circumstances. With the CDIT in place and more plans to future-proof
the system, the unspoken need for the infrastructure to support such schemes
will remain robust and handle changes without major overhauls.</p>
<p>While such work is little known to the public, it ultimately supports
outcomes that are very visible and impactful to most Singaporeans.</p>
<p>GovTech UX designer Wu Ting Ting shared that her most memorable moment
from working on this project was the successful payment of the GST Voucher
in August 2022.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen my family and friends happily informed me that they received the
grant in their bank account, it reassured me that the work done with my
scrum team is meaningful and impactful. This also helps to motivate me
to continue improving the user experience for our business users so that
our platform can benefit more fellow Singaporeans.‚Äù</p>
