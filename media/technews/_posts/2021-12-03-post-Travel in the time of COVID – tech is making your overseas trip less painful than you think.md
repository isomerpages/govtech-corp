concerns may be holding some back from dusting off their passports.</p>
<p>If this describes the dilemma you are facing about whether to organise

<h3>Vaccine certification and authentication digitalised</h3>
<p>Many of you are no doubt familiar with the Google Pay app that enables
cashless payments, but did you know that your&nbsp;vaccination certificate&nbsp;can
also be stored there? This feature is all the more important since a lot
of travel now depends on whether one is vaccinated and clear of Covid before
travel. Proof of vaccination and pre-departure results need to be tamper-proof,
convenient to present, and easily authenticated.</p>
<p>The tech powering the digital vaccination certificates is&nbsp;HealthCerts,
a digital open standard for test results and vaccination certification.
The system ensures that tamper-proof e-documents can be shared with travel
authorities. The open eco-system means private companies and public entities
can easily opt-in.</p>
<p>HealthCert providers give issuance services to clinics and labs. So far,
there are 14 providers that are connected to over 700 institutions which
have a presence in around 30 places, such as Canada, France, Hong Kong,
and Indonesia.</p>
<h3>Contactless boarding procedure</h3>
<p>The pandemic has made us think twice about what we touch, so the boarding
process has been revamped to minimise contact with surfaces and others.</p>
<p>For starters, online and mobile check-in is increasingly replacing the
need to queue at counters. The Singapore Airlines (SIA) app can even generate
a&nbsp;digital boarding pass&nbsp;that enables passengers to proceed through
the airport.</p>
<p>Passengers can also use the app to declare the number of baggage and auto-print
their baggage tags at the airport.</p>
<p>Even if there is a need to use check-in kiosks, there are now 160 newly
installed ones with proximity touch screens that can track finger movements
using infrared sensors. Users can thus use the kiosks through gestures
instead of touching the screen.</p>
<p>As for immigration clearance, facial and iris recognition is replacing
fingerprint scanning as the primary biometric identifier at Changi Airport.
Be sure to check if your&nbsp;facial and iris biometric information&nbsp;has
been enrolled with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority!</p>
<h3>Mobile app for in-flight entertainment and reading</h3>
<p>A big part of the pleasure of flying is no doubt the in-flight entertainment
system (movies, games, music!) and the magazines stuffed into the seat
pocket, where you can pick up nuggets of information about the place you‚Äôre
headed to.</p>
<p>The aviation industry has been moving towards incorporating passengers‚Äô
mobile devices into the inflight entertainment system in recent years,
but the pandemic has accelerated this trend.</p>
<p>Passengers on selected SIA aircraft can operate the inflight entertainment
system using the SIA app on their mobile devices, eliminating the need
to touch the aircraft‚Äôs touchscreens.</p>
<p>And though inflight magazines have been removed, passengers have access
to an even wider selection of reading material now on the SIA app, with
titles like National Geographic, Conde Nast Traveller, and Harvard Business
Review available in SIA‚Äôs e-library.</p>
<h3>One-stop map for travel regulations</h3>
<p>If your choice of destination is heavily dependent on the travel regulations
in place for that country, check out this map by the International Air
Transport Association. You can click on any country, and the latest list
of travel regulations or restrictions will be displayed. The&nbsp;map is
also colour-coded&nbsp;in terms of the restrictiveness of the rules in
place for each country.</p>
<p>Not quite spinning a globe and heading off to the place where your finger
lands, but close enough in our time of pandemic.</p>
<p>Do double-check the regulations with other sources, as we have learnt
by now that the pandemic situation changes quickly.</p>
<h3>The world is still your oyster</h3>
<p>With the right attitude and digital tools, travelling during these times
can still be pulled off and enjoyable!</p>
<p>And when you‚Äôre back from your adventure, you will not only have tales
and photos to share but Covid travel hacks as well.</p>
<p>Bon voyage!</p>
