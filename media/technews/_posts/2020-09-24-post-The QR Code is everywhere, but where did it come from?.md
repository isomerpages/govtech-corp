<h3>We know the drill by now: before entering any shop/restaurant/building, whip out your smartphone, look for the SafeEntry QR code, scan it, enter your personal particulars, and finally tap 'check-in'.</h3>

<p>Short on time? Check out this 90-second video for the QR Code origin story!</p>
<p>You’ve probably scanned more QR codes in the last few months than you
did in your entire life. They’ve saved us from filling up endless paper
forms on clipboards, so let’s take a moment to learn more about these black-and-white
heroes.</p>
<h3>So just what exactly is a QR code?</h3>
<p>When you use the self-checkout counter at a supermarket, you scan the
barcodes of your purchases. The barcode contains data about the item it’s
attached to, so the electronic cashier immediately knows you’re buying
a bag of Kettle salt &amp; fresh ground pepper potato chips the moment
you scan it.</p>
<p>Well, the QR – which stands for “quick response” – code is basically a
barcode on steroids. While the barcode holds information horizontally,
the QR code does so both horizontally and vertically. This enables the
QR code to hold over a hundred times more information.</p>
<h3>How did it come about?</h3>
<p>In the early 1990s, barcode scanning was becoming increasingly laborious.
Each barcode could hold just 20 characters of data, so it often took multiple
barcodes on a box to convey what was inside. When a Japanese engineer by
the name of Hara Masahiro – who made barcode scanners for a living – learnt
of the problem, he set about solving it.</p>
<p>Together with his team, Hara developed a two-dimensional barcode in the
shape of a square, tackling the issue of limited data capacity. However,
when these new barcodes were printed with other forms of text next to them,
scanning machines could not pick them up. This rendered the square barcodes
impractical.</p>
<p>This impasse was overcome one day when Hara, looking out of the subway
window on the way to work, noticed that skyscrapers stood out distinctively
from the rest of the landscape. He began searching for ways to distinguish
the square barcodes from text.</p>
<p>Finally, he landed on the solution of embedding three small squares (with
a specific ratio of black-to-white areas) at the corners of the new barcode,
enabling scanners to recognise it instantaneously.</p>

<p>QR Codes are anchored by squares in the corner. Now you know what they
are for!</p>
<h3>Dealing with imperfections</h3>
<p>Another issue that Hara mulled over was whether the new barcode could
still be read if it was obscured by smudges or otherwise damaged.</p>
<p>Again, he gleaned inspiration from his surroundings, this time while playing
Go (the Japanese board game, not Pokemon Go) during lunch. Although players
were supposed to place their pieces at the intersections of the grid board,
he noticed that you could still figure out where a piece was supposed to
be even if its placement was slightly off. This gave him confidence that
barcode scanners could similarly understand imperfect square barcodes.</p>
<p>Indeed, QR codes today are known for their robustness and can be scanned
even when part of it is missing or covered. Brands sometimes make use of
this feature by placing their logo in a QR code to drum up some brand recognition
without compromising functionality.</p>
<h3>Wowing the crowd</h3>
<p>In 1994, Hara was finally ready to roll out his brainchild. As Hara worked
for a subsidiary of a car components manufacturer, he demonstrated its
use at an automobile trade meeting, winning over representatives from several
firms.</p>
<p>Japan’s car companies quickly adopted them after the successful showcase,
a strong vote of confidence in this new invention.</p>
<h3>From obscurity to ubiquity</h3>
<p>The QR code might have just remained a workhorse for product cataloguing
if it had not been for another invention: mobile devices with cameras.
As people soon became inseparable from their smartphones, everyone always
had a QR code scanner at their fingertips wherever they went.</p>
<p>That said, its rise to mainstream adoption&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-curious-comeback-of-the-dreaded-qr-code/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">wasn’t easy</a>.
As recent as the 2010s, you needed to download a variety of apps to scan
various codes. Very frustrating and not exactly what we’d call good user
experience.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, QR codes were just ahead of their time. It took awhile
for smartphones to catch up, but these days, you no longer need a separate
app to scan QR codes. For instance, iPhones with iOS 11 (launched in 2017)
or later can read QR codes using just the standard camera app.</p>
<p>Nowadays, QR codes are used for a myriad of purposes, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Advertising (connecting consumers to a brand’s website or discounts)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E-payments (particularly deep penetration in China, thanks to WeChat)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joining WiFi networks without having to enter passwords</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing more information about exhibits at museums.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few companies have even added QR codes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2011/04/seattle-company-quiring-monuments-adds.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gravestones</a>&nbsp;to
let people know more about the deceased!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, the QR code enables SafeEntry in Singapore right now.
The system is vital in ensuring that contact tracers can do their jobs
even as Singapore progressively reopens and people-to-people interactions
inevitably increase.</p>
<p>So when you’re out and about, whip out your smartphone and do your part.</p>
