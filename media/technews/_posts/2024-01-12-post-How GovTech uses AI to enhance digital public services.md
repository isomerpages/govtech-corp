<p>Artificial Intelligence is already changing the way we work and play,
and the impact will only get larger as the technology evolves rapidly.</p>
<p>Here at GovTech, we too are integrating AI into our services to leverage
its promise, and also introducing the technology to various branches of
the government as well.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how AI is already improving the lives of Singaporeans,
as well as what potential it has in the near future!</p>
<h3>The impact of “old AI”</h3>
<p>The recent buzz has been all about generative AI in the form of text and
image generators such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. But GovTech has already been
successfully deploying AI even before this current stage of the technology.
For instance, the One Service Chatbot has been in operation since&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives/urban-living/oneservice-chatbot/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2021</a>, enabling residents to report municipal issues such as neighbourhood
cleanliness and facility breakdowns via a chatbot on WhatsApp and Telegram.</p>
<p>It handles some 30,000 cases a month, automating the extraction of case
details, predicting the category of cases, and automatically routing the
cases to relevant government agencies. The tool has saved about 2,000 man
hours, speeding up case resolution by up to two working days.</p>
<p>Another area where AI is already having an impact is in identifying cases
of dementia, where the longstanding practice of diagnosing the condition
involves getting a specialist referral to a trained psychologist who administers
a 30 minute test.</p>
<p>This process is being replaced by a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives/health/project-pensieve/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">drawing app</a>&nbsp;that
is being trialled with 1,000 seniors. The app challenges users to draw
certain shapes or objects. The drawings are then evaluated by AI to determine
the likelihood of dementia. Best of all, the test does not need to be administered
by medical professionals.</p>
<p>As for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">My Careers Future</a>&nbsp;job
portal, it incorporates a recommendation system (very much the same way
Netflix suggests your next binge fix based on what you’ve watched) that
uses 10 different AI models to improve job matching and help plan your
next career move.</p>
<h3>The promise of generative AI</h3>
<p>With generative AI taking the world by storm, GovTech is exploring ways
to integrate this groundbreaking technology into its services.</p>
<p>For example, the team is working with ChatGPT4’s new ability to evaluate
not just text but also photos. If the One Service Chatbot is&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/V4mF6UeZUGA?feature=shared&amp;t=110" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">enhanced with this function</a>,
users can simply submit a picture of an HDB corridor cluttered with stuff,
and the chatbot will automatically generate a case for clutter posing a
fire hazard and health concerns.</p>
<p>Generative AI’s ability to create video content in different languages
is also a boon for multilingual Singapore, as there is the potential to
create instructional videos in multiple languages using&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/V4mF6UeZUGA?feature=shared&amp;t=245" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AI-powered translation</a>&nbsp;and
voice generation.</p>
<p>AI can also take on the role of career coaching for people who are in
the initial stages of pondering their next career move. An accountant who
is considering a career switch to data science could enter the following
prompt: “I am an accountant who wants to work in tech. My friends suggested
the role of a data scientist. Is it a good career move?”</p>
<p>The chatbot can&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/V4mF6UeZUGA?feature=shared&amp;t=454" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">reply within seconds</a>&nbsp;about
the common and different skills between an accountant and a data scientist,
compare pay scales, and recommend training courses with links to the Skills
Future webpage. Tweaks can also be made to dial up the empathy in such
career coaching bots.</p>
<h3>How GovTech can move fast</h3>
<p>There are several factors that have enabled GovTech to move fast in the
realm of AI.</p>
<p>Firstly, AI – be it “old” or “new” – is only as good as the quality of
data that it can access.</p>
<p>To that end, GovTech has been investing resources into assembling high-quality
data sets that can be used to train AI models for the purposes of the myriad
public services in Singapore.</p>
<p>GovTech also has relationships with stakeholders at various levels. Regular
communication with fellow public servants across different agencies and
ministries, as well as with members of the public, means the team truly
understands their needs and can focus on building products that meet those
needs from day one. In addition, events such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/communities/events/conferences/stackx-data-ai-2023/overview.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STACK-X DSAID</a>&nbsp;showcase
thought leadership and foster productive discussion on the impact of AI,
while the Singapore Government&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/collections/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/index.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Developer Portal</a>&nbsp;acts
as a central repository of its AI projects.</p>
<p>Last but not least, a culture of innovation constantly encourages GovTechies
to move at speed and iterate through various cycles of a product, allowing
rapid experimentation and feedback.</p>
<p>To that end,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/V4mF6UeZUGA?feature=shared&amp;t=764" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Launchpad</a>&nbsp;–
a whole of government AI innovation platform – lets users pitch ideas,
experiment, and see AI in action. Users can submit their ideas and then
get the necessary tech support to build a workable prototype.</p>
<h3>Scaling for the whole of government</h3>
<p>GovTech is also planning for a future where the ability to use&nbsp;
<a href="https://youtu.be/V4mF6UeZUGA?feature=shared&amp;t=1127" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AI is a fundamental skill</a>. It is coming up with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/collections/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/playbooks/prompt-engineering-playbook-beta-v3.pdf" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">prompt engineering playbook,</a>&nbsp;in
anticipation of AI prompting becoming a core competency. It is also working
with the Civil Service College to come up with a prompt engineering course.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also developing a holistic AI framework so that
the development and use of AI within the public service will be guided
by a coherent, long-term strategy.</p>
<p>With that, we can ensure that the public service keeps up with the times,
leveraging technology to remain world-class into the future!</p>
