<h3>TL:DR: Vietnam is gearing up for the second Trump-Kim Summit, scheduled for 27-28 February 2019. Find out how GovTech officers played a crucial role in the first Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore on 12 June 2018.</h3>
<p>When American singer Katy Perry sang ‚ÄòHot N Cold‚Äô, she could not have
imagined that the lyrics of her song would be an apt description for the
lead-up to a historic meeting between US president Mr Donald Trump and
North Korean leader Mr Kim Jong Un. For indeed, the two politicians were
blowing hot and cold between the time Trump announced by Tweet (on 10 May
2018) that his meeting with Kim would take place on 12 June 2018 in Singapore.</p>
<p>As the drama unfurled on the global stage, Mr Ng Boon Seong and Ms Lee
Pei Pei, GovTech officers seconded to the Ministry of Communications and
Information (MCI) were mobilised to get Singapore ready to receive more
than 3,000 reporters and their crew who would inevitably want to cover
the momentous event.</p>

<h3>A portal into unchartered territory</h3>
<p>Instructions to prepare for the Summit came as a message to Mr Ng‚Äôs mobile
phone on 12 May 2018.</p>
<p>On 24 May, the meeting seemed uncertain as Trump wrote a letter to Kim
saying that ‚Äúit is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned
meeting‚Äù.</p>
<p>Amidst the uncertainty, Ng and Lee forged ahead with setting up an International
Media Centre (IMC) for the world‚Äôs press corps. In particular, the MCI
team was tasked with creating a media accreditation system for international
media personnel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe MCI‚Äôs existing Press Accreditation Card Online (PACOnline) system
requires journalists to log in with SingPass to get accreditation. But
foreign media personnel obviously wouldn‚Äôt have SingPass, so we needed
an alternative solution,‚Äù said Mr Ng.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what transpired behind the scenes of the Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore,
with key learning points the team picked up along the way.</p>
<h3>Sourcing for solutions (16-18 May 2018)</h3>
<p>Building a media accreditation system as an extension of the PACOnline
system would simply take too much time, so the team sought out solutions
that were already available on the market.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSince the summit is a one-off event, we wanted a secure, scalable and
flexible software-as-a-service solution which can be tailored to our requirements,‚Äù
said Mr Ng.</p>
<p>Lesson 1: Set clear requirements</p>
<p><em>In this case, the MCI team was looking for a fully integrated event management software. The software had to comply with the policies, regulations and codes of practice for IT security defined by the Singapore Government. A web application firewall, data encryption in transit and 2FA for administrator access were deemed necessary.</em>
</p>
<p>After considering various registration solutions, the team selected a
vendor which had experience in providing ICT solutions to the Singapore
Government. The Vendor also facilitated many large-scale events, including
the Singapore FinTech Festival.</p>
<p>Lesson 2: Select tried and tested solutions</p>
<p><em>For mission-critical events, you don‚Äôt want to reinvent the wheel, but rather choose something that is reliable in a similar context.</em>
</p>
<h3>Customisation, testing and launch of the portal (18-24 May 2018)</h3>
<p>As much as the selected registration solution was a ready-for-market solution,
it needed to be tweaked to cope with the scale of the Summit. The MCI Team
swung into action, working closely with the Vendor‚Äôs technical experts‚Äî
to change the software‚Äôs architecture, establish workflow, cut out unused
code, optimise data retrievals and implement security checks.</p>
<p>Multiple rounds of performance testing through the wee hours of the night
were carried out to ensure that the portal was robust enough to handle
large volumes of transactions and ensure the contingency plans for failover
were smooth and seamless.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Cybersecurity Group at the Government Technology Agency
of Singapore chipped in to carry out penetration testing, making sure that
the system could withstand cyberattacks. Once these were done, the portal
was launched on 24 May 2018 for international media personnel to start
registering for accreditation.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3: Partner for success</strong>
</p>
<p><em>The public and private sectors have different strengths. Where the stakes are high, pooling resources and talent helps expedite processes and raise operational standards.</em>
</p>
<h3>Setting up at the IMC (8-9 June 2018)</h3>
<p>The next challenge was getting registration booths ready at the IMC itself.
This involved making sure that international media personnel could simply
show up, scan a QR code and enter the F1 pit building.</p>
<p>Upon examining the facilities supporting the network infrastructure and
expected human traffic, the MCI Team decided that it was important to have
a backup offline database with accredited journalists‚Äô credentials on-site,
just in case internet connectivity was disrupted, which in turn would affect
the flow of journalists into the IMC.</p>
<p>The Vendor designed a standalone offline database within a day. Despite
the haste, the system was tested multiple times, with support personnel
from the telecommunications provider on standby in case of any network
issues. The registration flow ‚Äì both virtual and physical ‚Äì was also altered
to ensure the registration process can withstand any power outage with
no impact on the media personnel registration.</p>
<p>Lesson 4: Plan for contingencies</p>
<p><em>While it is impossible to predict everything that could go wrong during a live event, brainstorming about potential problems allows you to put failsafe measures in place for some of them.</em>
</p>
<h3>All systems go (10-12 June 2018)</h3>
<p>On 10 June 2018, Mr Trump flew into Singapore‚Äôs Paya Lebar airbase in
Air Force One and Mr Kim arrived at Changi Airport on an Air China flight.
Journalists also started checking in to the IMC.</p>
<p>After a frenetic few weeks of preparation, the MCI team watched as thousands
of accredited journalists came to the Media Centre, collect their press
badges and went on to cover the Summit. All without a hitch or drop in
service levels ‚Äì peaceful with no fuss! The summit proceeded smoothly on
12 June 2018.</p>
<p>Yet, the MCI Team could not stand down till the last of the media crew
had left. For the first time in weeks, the team enjoyed a night without
calls, watching monitors, and any anxiety.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt have pulled it off without teamwork,‚Äù said Ms Lee. ‚ÄúAlthough
it was a really tight timeline, everyone worked hard towards a common goal
and had fun as well.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lesson 5: Don‚Äôt forget to have fun!</p>
<p><em>Making history can be tough, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be enjoyable and satisfying.</em>
