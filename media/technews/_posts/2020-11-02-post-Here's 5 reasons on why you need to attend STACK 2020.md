<p>Why you â€“ yes you! â€“ need to attend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stack.gov.sg/?utm_source=govtech&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=stack2020&amp;utm_content=technews" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STACK 2020</a>.
Having chosen tech as your career, you can probably relate to times when
you run out of ideas, feel stagnated or lagged simply because technology
is advancing by leaps and bounds. STACK 2020 offers you an opportunity
to refresh your mind, learn new ways of doing things, and interact with
new people.</p>
<p>Take a break from your daily grind to attend STACK 2020, GovTechâ€™s flagship
conference, which takes place from 1 to 3 December 2020. The technical
workshops on 1 December are just S$50 each while the conference from 2
to 3 December is absolutely FREE.</p>
<p>Need more reasons to attend? We bring you five more compelling reasons
that will get you excited about interacting with some of the best and brightest
in the global tech community.</p>
<h3>1. Learn from the pros</h3>
<p>STACK 2020 brings together more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stack.gov.sg/speakers" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">100 of the worldâ€™s leading technology experts</a>&nbsp;to
share their knowledge and insights. Some of the keynote speakers you will
get to hear from include Mr&nbsp;<strong>Gene Kim</strong>, founder of
IT Revolution, researcher and author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller
The Unicorn Project, and Mr&nbsp;<strong>Will Grannis</strong>, founder
and leader of Googleâ€™s Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO).</p>
<p>Also gracing the event is Mr&nbsp;<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>, Chief
Scientist of ThoughtWorks, who is also a renowned author, software consultant
and highly regarded speaker at international conferences. He brings with
him two decades of experience helping organisations utilise object technology
for mission-critical information systems.</p>
<h3>2. Ideate and innovate</h3>
<p>No organisation has a monopoly on ideas. Given the rapid developments
in the field of technology, being aware of some of the latest emerging
ideas can be a boon for anyone working in tech. With more than 80 keynotes,
talks, panels, workshops and on-demand videos covering topics on Cloud,
Applications, Tech Culture and COVID-19 technologies at STACK 2020, you
will be exposed to new concepts and novel ways of working that could help
you level up professionally!</p>
<h3>3. Network makes the dream work</h3>
<p>As the largest government-led developer conference in Singapore, STACK
2020 will be a virtual meeting place for some 1,000 developers, data scientists,
product managers, designers and technologists around the world. You will
have ample opportunity to make connections and build up your professional
network. You might just find the ideal mentor or discover a tech community
to kickstart your next big project!</p>
<h3>4. Gain hands-on experience</h3>
<p>The best way to learn is by doing. At STACK 2020, you will find an array
of hands-on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stack.gov.sg/workshops" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">workshops</a>&nbsp;catering
to individuals of various skill levels and interests. For example, join
a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stack.gov.sg/workshops#workshop-a2" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">coding dojo</a>&nbsp;to
work on a coding puzzle with other coders, or try your hand at&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.stack.gov.sg/workshops#workshop-p4" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">enhancing mobile app security through reverse engineering.</a>
</p>
<p>Cybersecurity professionals looking to add to their skill arsenal may
also wish to learn how to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stack.gov.sg/workshops#workshop-a3" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">identify vulnerabilities in the tech stack</a>&nbsp;of
an IoT ecosystem. Meanwhile, Docker and Kubernetes beginners can look forward
to a step-by-step course on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stack.gov.sg/workshops#workshop-a5" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">how to design, develop and deploy applications in Kubernetes.</a>&nbsp;All
workshops will take place on 1 December 2020.</p>
<h3>5. Rekindle your passion</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the plodding regularity of the office routine can make you
forget why you chose your current job or career path. If that is the case,
interacting with industry peers and seeing how they share their work with
enthusiasm is one way to re-energise and recharge. You might just return
to the office all fired up with fresh ideas and confidence in 2021.</p>
<p>With these reasons, we are sure that you will find the event relevant,
refreshing and insightful. Join us virtually at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stack.gov.sg/?utm_source=govtech&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=stack2020&amp;utm_content=technews" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STACK 2020</a>,
