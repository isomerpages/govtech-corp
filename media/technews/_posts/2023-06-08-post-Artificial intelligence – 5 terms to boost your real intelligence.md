<p>Artificial intelligence, or AI for short, has been all the rage in recent
times. A few years ago, self-driving cars showed great promise and there
were predictions that automated cars would become the norm very soon and
taxi drivers would lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Predictions about that particular branch of AI proved too optimistic (or
pessimistic, depending on your point of view). But that hasn‚Äôt dampened
the enthusiasm about AI as AI-generated text and pictures are the new kids
on the block, astounding everyone with their ability to produce art and
write essays that could pass off as the work of a real-life person.</p>
<p>While this article won‚Äôt make you an expert in the technology, it‚Äôll introduce
some relevant terms so that you can follow along during conversations.
Perhaps you‚Äôll even get good enough to drop in a few phrases at the right
moments. We‚Äôll even throw in some examples of AI right here in Singapore!</p>

<h3>1. Machine learning</h3>
<p>As its name suggests,&nbsp;<a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">machine learning</a>&nbsp;is
all about enabling a machine to learn and is what is driving the gigantic
improvements in AI in recent times.</p>
<p>Instead of learning by rules that are explicitly programmed, machine learning
allows a computer to learn through examples. Imagine having to teach a
child what a cat is. You could spend all day describing how a cat has four
legs, a tail, whiskers, etc, and chances are the child might not even recognise
a cat when he or she sees one in real life. Or you could show the child
five pictures of a cat and voila, he or she will be pointing out cats at
your HDB void deck.</p>
<p>While it takes thousands of pictures for a machine to learn to recognise
a cat, it turns out that if you show enough pictures of a cat to a machine,
it eventually is able to process a picture of a cat it‚Äôs never seen before
and correctly say, ‚ÄúAha! That‚Äôs a cat!‚Äù The general principle is what‚Äôs
driving the AI behind human detection in surveillance cameras, automated
transcribing of speech, and spotting signs of diseases in medical scans.</p>
<p>The explosion in data production means that machines have ever more data
to consume, and therefore more examples to learn from.</p>
<h3>2. Neural networks and deep learning</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Neural networks</a>&nbsp;are
a more complex form of machine learning that uses nodes to process data.
These nodes are interconnected and form layers that, taken together, form
the neural network. Data is processed within the nodes in a layer and then
passed on to the next layer until output is eventually generated from the
final layer.</p>
<p>So a neural network that is fed pictures of cats would ingest each image
through its layers, spotting patterns among the many pictures and enabling
it to learn that cat pictures usually have certain features.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve heard the term deep learning, it simply refers to a neural network
with more than three layers. Some deep learning models are so complex that
they are described as&nbsp;<a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/f9kuryi8/release/8" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">black boxes</a>,
and even the people who created them cannot fully explain how they work.</p>
<h3>3. Generative AI</h3>
<p>AI has gone from absorbing content and making predictions to creating
the content itself. That‚Äôs essentially what&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-generative-ai" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">generative AI</a>&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>Need a hyperreal graphic of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/technology/ai-generated-art-jobs-dall-e-2.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">parrot made of carrots?</a>&nbsp;DALL-E
can create it with just a few text prompts. Feel like reading a summarised
version of a literary classic with some analysis of its themes? ChatGPT
has your back.</p>
<p>One of the amazing things about generative AI is its ability to understand
prompts that are written in plain English, just like the way you would
make a request to another human. And that‚Äôs largely possible because of
the next topic.</p>
<h3>4. Natural language processing</h3>
<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">branch of AI</a>&nbsp;is
all about enabling computers to understand text and speech the same way
humans are able to.</p>
<p>The main challenge of NLP is in determining the intended meaning when
confronted with ambiguity, sarcasm (‚ÄúI‚Äôm sooooo impressed‚Äù), idioms (‚ÄúHe‚Äôs
over the moon‚Äù), and metaphors (‚ÄúAn ego too big to fit this room‚Äù).</p>
<p>Again, deep learning is powering the improvements in NLP, enabling machines
to consume voluminous writing and audio clips to enhance their ability
to predict what word should come next.</p>
<p>Think how much better it is to pick up Thai by immersing oneself in Bangkok
for months instead of spending the same time reading a grammar textbook
and a dictionary, and you get the idea.</p>
<p>NLP is what‚Äôs behind tools like Google translate, Siri and Alexa, and
chatbots.</p>
<h3>5. VICA ‚Äì Virtual Intelligent Chat Assistant</h3>
<p>If you have visited government websites, you would probably remember Ask
Jamie ‚Äì GovTech‚Äôs virtual assistant, which was rolled out in 2014. That
said, her days are numbered.</p>
<p>Jamie‚Äôs replacement,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/vica/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VICA</a>&nbsp;,
is already out answering citizens‚Äô queries in the wild. Armed with next-generation
NLP, it‚Äôs already powering the chatbots on multiple government websites.</p>
<p>At the time of publication, VICA was in operation for IRAS (Ask IRAS),
EMA (Ask EMMA), and ICA (Ask ICA).</p>
<p>There are also plans for Singpass integration, live chat escalation, and
support for multiple chat platforms like Whatsapp and Telegram.</p>
<h3>Time for some human learning</h3>
<p>AI's encroachment on creative, white-collar jobs has left many professionals
feeling uneasy about their future.</p>
<p>However, in the face of uncertainty, we can equip ourselves with knowledge
and face this challenge head-on. Let's embrace the ever-evolving tech landscape,
seizing the opportunities it presents.</p>
<p>By understanding AI's intricacies and seeking ways to collaborate, we
can harness its power to amplify our creativity. Stay positive and curious,
never ceasing to learn and explore. Together, we can shape a future where
human and artificial intelligence harmoniously coexist, opening doors to
remarkable achievements.</p>
<p>As Alan Turing wisely said, "We can only see a short distance ahead, but
we can see plenty there that needs to be done."</p>
<h3>Let's embark on this transformative journey with resilience and optimism.</h3>
