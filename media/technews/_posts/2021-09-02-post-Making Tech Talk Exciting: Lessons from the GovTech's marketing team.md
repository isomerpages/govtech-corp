<p>Most people might know GovTech for our tech projects and the wonderful
teams who develop them. You know, the new and improved&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singpass</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;

</p>
<p>What might be less apparent, though, is the team of people who manage
comms and ensure the word actually gets out to the public.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs right ‚Äì we‚Äôre talking about our award-winning marketing team.</p>
<p>Award-winning? Yup.</p>
<p>For two years now, our marketing team has been silently picking up a steady
stream of awards. Or more specifically, seven awards, punching above their
weight to beat strong corporate brands in marketing, media relations, product
launch, mobile marketing, and more!</p>
<p>We spoke to the team to find out the lessons learnt from their experience,
as well as some of their challenges.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what they had to say about their winning formula.</p>

<h3>Don‚Äôt rely purely on news coverage</h3>
<p>Many communications teams depend heavily on mainstream and digital media
publications to publicise their products and services.</p>
<p>However, this approach can be ad-hoc and heavily dependent on variables
such as the journalist‚Äôs ability to simplify the technical content, media
news cycle and agenda.</p>
<p>To drive sustained engagement and increase understanding of GovTech products
and services, the team expanded its ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù scope of work beyond
the traditional ‚Äúmedia relations‚Äù duties, where we are already intensifying
candid engagement with media stakeholders.</p>
<p>On top of that, in-house content (including this blog!) is an increasingly
important part of our communication strategy to put out information such
as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>tech tips such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/this-is-why-you-need-a-vpn" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">usefulness of VPN</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behind the scenes, look to see how everyday tools like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/developing-the-one-service-chatbot" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OneService chatbot works</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/18658822510/videos/795096021207624" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Interviews</a>&nbsp;with
GovTechies on how the Government uses tech to better our lives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marketing is important ‚Äì even for government organisations!</h3>
<p>People from all backgrounds and at different stages of their lives use
government e-services. Moreover, these users are also comparing their government
e-service experience with services from big tech companies like Google
and Netflix.</p>
<p>Hence, GovTech‚Äôs products must appeal to as wide an audience as possible
and be comparable to the best tech products.</p>
<p>To meet these high standards, platforms such as the&nbsp;<a href="/our-communities/join-our-communities/tech-kaki/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tech Kaki Community</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="https://t.me/s/govtechbytes" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GovTech‚Äôs Telegram</a>&nbsp;channel are invaluable in getting feedback
and soliciting for user testing right from the start. Feedback is then
rapidly incorporated as we develop our products using agile principles
that iterate through different versions quickly.</p>
<p>The agile ethos extends to communications as we constantly test fresh
marketing approaches, use data to make better decisions, and regularly
review and do away with methods that don‚Äôt work. These guidelines enable
us to come up with the most effective ways of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Highlighting the benefits of a product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explaining how it will create convenience in interacting with the Government</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convincing people that it will improve their lives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in helping shape Government e-services, sign up to
be part of the Tech<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/get-involved/tech-kaki-newsletter?utm_source=techkaki&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=referral" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;Kaki</a>&nbsp;community,
where you may be invited to co-create some of GovTech‚Äôs products!</p>
<h3>Overcoming the challenges of a wide target audience</h3>
<p>Typically, brands get to tailor-fit their messages or products to specific
or niche audiences ‚Äì based on factors such as age, interest, or gender.</p>
<p>However, as mentioned earlier, government digital services generally do
not get to choose the audience demographic segment they would like to serve.</p>
<p>Adding to the challenge is that people don‚Äôt use government services because
it‚Äôs trending, fun, entertaining or cool to do so ‚Äì it‚Äôs because they have
to transact with the Government. Which‚Ä¶well, may not always rank highly
on their ‚Äòfavourite things to do‚Äô list.</p>
<p>Well, the audience might be broad, but the comms doesn‚Äôt have to be. To
get around this, we cater communications efforts to speak to the needs,
preferences, biases, lingo, and widely varying levels of familiarity with
our products.</p>
<p>This often means creating different campaigns for each key audience segment,
be they students, people just entering the workforce, mid-careerists, parents
with babies, parents with school-going children, people with disabilities
or seniors.</p>
<p>Through specific communications catered to their needs, audiences can
then appreciate how a digital service is relevant to them at their particular
stage in life.</p>
<h3>Tech cannot replace good communication</h3>
<p>With today‚Äôs focus on technology, technical expertise might receive most
of the attention. However, there is a lot of merit in involving comms and
marketing personnel because the communication of the product IS part of
the product.</p>
<p>For example, the TraceTogether system is only useful when there‚Äôs widespread
use, and widespread use can only be achieved when the benefits TraceTogether
are effectively communicated to the public. Today, TraceTogether is a key
pillar in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
<p>Lim Keng Soon, Head of Communications and Marketing Group, GovTech, said,
‚ÄúWe are constantly reimagining modes of marketing and challenging the status
quo to better tell our stories ex amino. Everyone is content-inundated;
we want people to feel something when they see our content - happy or sad
regardless - and hopefully, remember that we are here to make lives better
through technology.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the end, both the product teams and comms teams have the same goal:
Adoption by the greater public.</p>
<p>By translating policy and technical jargon into layman's terms, the public
is more likely to relate better to the product and understand the benefits!</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a win-win!</p>
