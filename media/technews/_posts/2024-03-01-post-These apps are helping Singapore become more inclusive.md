<p>The world has experienced an explosion in technology over the past few
years, and Singapore is no exception.</p>
<p>Cashless payments have become a way of life, even at hawker centres. Today,
many government services can be accessed easily and quickly by people who
are digital natives.</p>
<p>This is mostly good, but new technological developments often serve the
mass market first. This means that people with different needs and lower
socioeconomic status can get left behind due to the sheer speed at which
change is happening.</p>
<p>In response, GovTech has been striving to make life in Singapore inclusive.
Our team relentlessly experiments and tests solutions to close gaps, if
any. Sometimes they work out, sometimes they donâ€™t.</p>
<h3>MoneySound: An attempt to help hawkers deal with the digital divide</h3>
<p>You might not have heard this, but a product called MoneySound was previously
in the works. Let us explain.</p>
<p>When accepting digital payments, hawkers in Singapore â€“ especially the
elderly ones â€“ might have trouble keeping track of their digital payments
when theyâ€™re also taking orders, preparing the food, and serving customers.</p>
<p>In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/hawkers-scammed-by-fake-screenshots-of-e-payments" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Straits Times reported</a>&nbsp;that
in 2020, some dishonest folks created fake payment screenshots to mislead
hawkers into thinking they received payment.</p>
<p>In response, MoneySound was developed by a three-man GovTech team. The
product aimed to introduce audio alerts for digital payments, inspired
by devices in other countries that assist vendors in tracking transactions
without constant monitoring.</p>
<p>The team developed a â€˜proof-of-conceptâ€™ prototype within two months, but
upon further exploration, hawkersâ€™ feedback was tepid. Many were concerned
about the inconvenience of installing and maintaining an additional device
in their stalls.</p>
<p>Given these concerns and the hawkersâ€™ reluctance to adopt the technology,
GovTech decided to pause development three months into the project.</p>
<h3>Experimentation and failure are part of the process</h3>
<p>While the MoneySound project did not progress as hoped, its conception
and temporary setback underscore GovTechâ€™s commitment to bridging the digital
divide and ensuring technology benefits all segments of society, not just
the tech-savvy.</p>
<p>In the words of Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary, Singapore
needs to be bold in exploring different solutions, building prototypes
quickly, testing them with real users, and scaling the most promising ideas.</p>
<p>While not all experiments may yield the desired results, the insights
gained from setbacks are invaluable for future iterations!</p>
<p>As Singapore continues to push the boundaries of digital inclusion, it
is clear that the journey is as much about the innovations that take off
as it is about those that do not.</p>
<p>Some innovations that took off include solutions such as;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Purple A11y</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Legacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scamshield App and Bot</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ensuring digital services are accessible with Purple A11y</h3>
<p>Developed by the Accessibility Enabling Team (A11y Team),&nbsp;<a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/accessibility/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Purple </a>
<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/design/purple-a11y/overview.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A11y</a>&nbsp;is an open-source tool that developers can use to help them
build more inclusive products during the product development process.</p>
<p>The customisable and automated tool allows software development teams
to find and fix accessibility problems to help persons with disabilities
(PWDs) and the elderly access digital services more easily.</p>
<p>Using a bot, Purple A11y allows product development teams to rapidly scan
and check for potential accessibility issues from their development machines.
These include issues such as improper labelling of buttons, images, or
missing alternative (alt) text.</p>
<h3>Making conversations about death easier with MyLegacy</h3>
<p>Talking about oneâ€™s death is understandably difficult, but Singapore is
showing changing attitudes towards conversations surrounding this subject.
One way GovTech is doing its part is&nbsp;<a href="https://mylegacy.life.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyLegacy</a>,
a comprehensive digital portal designed for Singaporeans to securely plan
and store important documents related to legal, healthcare, and estate
matters.</p>
<p>Through this, weâ€™ve transformed the way Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA)
are created, making the process significantly more accessible for citizens.
By collaborating with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) and the Ministry
of Social and Family Development (MSF), weâ€™ve digitised and streamlined
the LPA application process, cutting down the turnaround time from three
weeks to just 15 minutes. This initiative not only simplifies the process
but also promotes early planning for personal well-being.</p>
<p>Since its rollout, weâ€™ve received over 57,000 LPA applications, reflecting
high user engagement and satisfaction. MyLegacyâ€™s intuitive design, featuring
digital signatures and the capability to pre-fill data, along with the
temporary waiver of the application fee, has made the LPA application process
far more approachable for everyone.</p>
<h3>Protecting would-be scam victims with ScamShield app</h3>
<p>Scams have been a major problem in Singapore in the past few years, with
Singaporeans losing over S$600 million in scam per year. Scammers change
their tactics often, and have become extremely convincing too.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why the government launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamshield.org.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield</a>&nbsp;in
2020, an app that helps individuals protect themselves against scam calls
and text messages.</p>
<p>ScamShield does so by checking calls from unknown numbers against a database
maintained by the Singapore Police Force, blocking calls from numbers that
have been used for scams.</p>
<p>The app also uses an on-device algorithm to check SMS from unknown numbers,
filtering scam SMSes to the Junk folder for iOS and notifying users of
potential scam messages on Android OS. Users can also use the app to report
scam calls and messages they receive, adding to the policeâ€™s database!</p>
<p>In the first half of 2023 alone, the ScamShield app blocked&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/180-million-scam-calls-blocked-in-first-half-of-2023-scamshield-blocked-80000-phone-numbers" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">180 million scam calls and 80,000 numbers</a>.</p>
<h3>Helping citizens do their part with the ScamShield bot</h3>
<p>Separately, the ScamShield Bot was developed to empower individuals with
the ability to easily verify and report potential scams encountered across
various platforms directly to the Singapore Police Force via WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The bot also provides users with information on how many others have reported
similar scams, leveraging crowdsourced data. This not only validates the
userâ€™s suspicions but also strengthens community awareness and resilience
against scams.</p>
<p>In addition, users can see the collective impact of their actions, showcasing
the number of scams reported and how these reports contribute to safeguarding
the community. This level of engagement and feedback is designed to motivate
continued participation in the collective fight against scams.</p>
<p>You can do your part to build a safer (and hence more inclusive) Singapore
by installing the <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/message/A2G6DGDFYVCHL1?autoload=1&amp;app_absent=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield bot</a>.</p>
