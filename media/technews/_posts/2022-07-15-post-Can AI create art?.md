<p>The Mona Lisa. Fur Elise. Swan Lake. Whenever we think of art, these are
some of the examples that come to mind, representing monumental expressions
of creativity that continue to stir emotions across centuries.</p>

<p><em>Can AI create art and music?</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Art is often thought of as a singularly human pursuit. But with the rise
of artificial intelligence or AI, in recent years, many tasks that have
long befuddled computers (such as differentiating between photos of dogs
and cats) are now easily performed by them.</p>
<p>Given the rapid technological progress, we ask the question – can AI create
art?</p>
<h3>Art is in the eye of the beholder</h3>
<p>There’s no straightforward answer to this question because there’s no
straightforward definition of art in the first place. As the examples in
the introduction show, art comes in many genres, to say nothing of the
vast differences within the genres themselves. Leonardo Da Vinci and Banksy
are both painters. Beethoven and Beyonce are both musicians. And Swan Lake
and Hamilton are both performing arts.</p>
<p>Humans themselves don’t agree on whether something – like, say, an&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-duchamps-urinal-changed-art-forever" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">upside down urinal</a>&nbsp;– is art.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, let’s group everything (music, literature,
painting, dance, and all that jazz) under creative activity. Or we can
adopt the maxim&nbsp;“l know it when I see it”.</p>
<h3>The future is now</h3>
<p>In a way, “Can AI create art?” is already an outdated question since there
are instances of it already happening.</p>
<p>Going back to Beethoven, his incomplete 10th Symphony was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/how-artificial-intelligence-completed-beethovens-unfinished-10th-symphony-180978753/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recently finished</a>&nbsp;thanks
to a group of music historians, composers, and computer scientists who
applied AI to the task.</p>
<p>A machine was fed the celebrated composer’s entire body of work as well
as his creative process. The team knew they were on the right track when
music scholars and experts listened to one of the iterations and couldn’t
tell where Beethoven’s original notes ended, and the AI’s additions began.</p>
<p>Or consider paintings&nbsp;that wouldn’t look out of place above the mantelpiece
in a castle. Except that the work did not come from a painter’s brush but
from lines of code. Other examples abound of AI-generated artwork that
looks right at home in the&nbsp;surrealism section&nbsp;of a museum. All
users have to do is input phrases like “a summer day” or “city lights at
night,” and the AI model does the rest.</p>
<p>What about other branches of art? In dance, AI has been used as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/05/arts/dance/dance-and-artificial-intelligence.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">choreographic tool</a>,
producing moves for both human and robot dancers.</p>
<p>And, of course, a lot has been said about AI-generated text. In 2020,
The Guardian published a news <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">column</a>&nbsp;written
by AI. The machine was fed a prompt of “why humans have nothing to fear
from AI”. The human editors’ verdict: “Overall, it took less time to edit
than many human op-eds.”</p>
<h3>Is what is created actually creative?</h3>
<p>So AI does produce things that look and sound like art and are generally
indistinguishable from human work.</p>
<p>Yet, if we go back to the definition of art as creative expression, then
AI art doesn’t meet that standard. After all, the basic way that machine-learning
powered AI works is to be exposed to lots of examples and then make a prediction
of what comes next.</p>
<p>Show a machine all of Beethoven’s music so that it can predict what note
should come next when given an incomplete Beethoven symphony. In that sense,
there’s no originality involved, merely a very skilled copy with certain
variations. It’s making a statistical guess of the best output, not producing
something out of heartbreak, joy, anger, or any emotion normally associated
with the arts. And it’s certainly not doing so out of an innate desire
to express itself.</p>
<p>Still, some would argue this is akin to disqualifying AI art as art on
a technicality. If we use the “I know it when I see it” yardstick, and
what we see can’t be differentiated from “the real deal”, then does the
lack of emotional motivation behind the production really matter?</p>
<p>As for the lack of originality, human artists themselves are constantly
inspired by what came before them. Shakespeare drew from Chaucer. Mozart
had a strong influence on Beethoven. So could it be said that AI is also
standing on the shoulders of giants, making something new after learning
from the best?</p>
<h3>More philosophy than technology</h3>
<p>Ultimately, the question of whether AI can create art seems to be one
that is more about philosophy than technology.</p>
<p>As tech improves inexorably, this question will become more central and
gain greater urgency. Our discussion today threw up some themes and perhaps
even more questions, but there’s no definitive answer right now. And we
suspect there won’t be for a while yet.</p>
