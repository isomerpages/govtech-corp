<p>In January 2020, a new virus spread at unprecedented speed across multiple
countries. Little was known about this novel threat ‚Äì it would be named
COVID-19 only in the next month ‚Äì and amid the uncertainty, misinformation
about the pandemic travelled as rapidly as the coronavirus itself. To combat
the flood of fake news, the Government had to pivot and find ways to communicate
accurate, verified information to Singaporeans across the globe directly.</p>

<p><a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a>&nbsp;is
a product built by GovTech‚Äôs Open Government Products (OGP) together with
the team at the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) under
the leadership of Minister Iswaran to address the unmet needs of updating
citizens with bite-size information rapidly and at scale. Using <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a>,
the <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Gov.sg</a> WhatsApp
channel was able to send a million messages within 22 minutes. This was
a feat that was the first of its kind, leading the wave to revamp how governments
across the world could provide accurate public health information to control
the pandemic. And the most amazing part? It was built in just three days,
said Jean Tan, the tech lead for <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a>‚Äôs engineering team at
OGP, who shared her experience in developing <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a> at the Stack 2020 Developers
Conference.</p>
<p>Well, know what they say ‚Äì modern problems require modern solutions.</p>
<h3>The need for speed!</h3>
<p>Towards the end of January, Jean‚Äôs team met with MCI to tackle the problem
at hand. MCI leadership emphasised the need to communicate on a timely
and frequent basis. Both teams came together and recognised that the existing
WhatsApp channel that was used for peacetime communication was not meant
for scale from a technical perspective and quickly pivoted to finding a
new solution.</p>
<p>As with any emergency operational processes, they started with manual
processes for the updating of subscription requests while waiting for tech
enhancement for the existing systems. One gap that was identified by the
teams within 24 hours of operation was the fact that the manual processing
of subscription requests was not scalable. There was a pressing demand
for official COVID-19 updates, given the uncertainty. However, the team
could not keep up with the influx of requests ‚Äì which they had to manually
process. The second gap identified was the sending speed of the existing
solution ‚Äì which was built for peacetime operations and scoped for a smaller
subscriber base. As a result of COVID-19, the subscriber base jumped from
around 7,000 to more than 50,000 overnight. The problem with lower sending
speed was that it would take 14 hours to send out half a million messages,
so the first and 500,000th recipient would get their messages more than
half a day apart. It was not ideal for a citizen to receive an update from
the government hours after someone else had received it.</p>
<p>Both MCI and the <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a> teams came together to
pivot a <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a> prototype
that was built during OGP‚Äôs hackathon to a new product that would address
the problems that the Government faced with COVID-19. The team pulled all-nighters
in the office to integrate <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a> with <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Form.gov.sg</a> and
Facebook‚Äôs WhatsApp Business Client ‚Äì where the subscription applications
were made ‚Äì to automate the processing, closing the four-hour lag.</p>
<p>After a couple of prototypes, MCI gave the go-ahead to launch on Feb 1,
just three days after their first meeting. Eventually, the team managed
to hit their target of sending out half a million messages in 10 minutes,
80 times faster than before.</p>
<p>## Overcoming technical difficulties However, things were far from smooth
sailing on launch day. The team was forced to scramble for solutions after
the boost in sending speed overwhelmed their cloud computing service. They
also had to come up with a more efficient database to read and store the
millions of messages that were generated after each broadcast. These issues
were valuable lessons in understanding the technical limits of the system
they were working with, Jean said.</p>
<p>This experience also taught her that she needed to know a system‚Äôs technical
capabilities in order to stretch them and, more importantly, that she should
not be afraid to push the boundaries.</p>
<p>For instance, the team noticed that each round of message sending involved
a time-consuming validation of the phone numbers that were being pinged.
Studying the technical documentation of the WhatsApp client closely, they
figured out that they could do the validation just once a day at a different
time from the broadcasts. As such, the system could now focus solely on
sending out messages without being bogged down by the validation process.</p>
<h3>Work in progress</h3>
<p>Today, MCI uses <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a> to
send a million messages two to three times a day. The tool, which can also
send email, SMS, and Telegram messages, has also been enhanced such that
any public officer with a <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gov.sg</a> email can use it. Entities without
a government issued email are also using <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a>. For example, hospitals
use the system to send out Covid-19 test results to individuals who did
swab tests.</p>
<p>The team is not done with <a href="https://postman.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Postman.gov.sg</a> and already has plans
to improve it, such as by adding a rich text editor so that its interface
resembles an email client. Perpetually on the lookout for feedback, Jean
encouraged everyone ‚Äì public officers or not ‚Äì to try out the tool and
reach out to the team with suggestions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always happy to talk to you about what you want to achieve with
Postman and help you achieve your goal,‚Äù she said.</p>
