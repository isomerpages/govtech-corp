<p>TL:DR: Students from junior colleges and universities built and raced
Arduino-based smart cars at GovTech’s GeekOut bootcamp, which ran from
18-22 June 2018. The workshop was facilitated by GovTech’s technical experts,
who helped students troubleshoot problems. TechNews spoke to the winners
of the smart car race about their experience at the five-day programme.</p>

<hr>
<p>There was a time when being called a ‘geek’ seemed like a bad thing. Not
anymore—with deep technology and digital disruption taking the world by
storm, geeks are now in demand all over the world for their technical expertise.</p>
<p>But how does one gain geek cred? For starters, they could join GovTech’s
GeekOut boot-camp, a five-day programme that ran from 18-22 June 2018 at
the Singapore Management University. The workshop saw students from junior
colleges and universities, who had close to zero knowledge of coding and
hardware programming, assemble an Arduino-based smart car and code an app
to control it. Experts at GovTech were on hand to help students kickstart
their engines and troubleshoot problems.</p>
<p>All these activities culminated in a race on the final day of the workshop,
where each team’s smart car was required to complete a track both manually
and autonomously. TechNews caught up with the winners of the competition
to find out how they felt about geeking out with GovTech.</p>

<h3>Igniting imagination and fostering teamwork</h3>
<p>While there was a fixed agenda during the five days, the participants
were free to experiment and iterate as they built their smart car.</p>
<p>“We were given the freedom and autonomy to explore our own interests and
try out new things, and that was very fun,” said Mr Wei Yuxin (JC1, Raffles
Junior College) whose team was the overall winner of the competition. He
described how he took some time to create a balancing car using an ultra-sound
sensor. This was not part of the race requirements, but it was something
he was curious about, and he implemented it anyway.</p>
<p>In addition to assembling cars, assembling teams was just as important.
This was something Mr Liew Zhao Wei (JC2, Hwa Chong Institution) found
out when he worked with Mr Wei and Mr Sathappan Lakshmanan (JC2, NUS High
School).</p>
<p>“We didn’t know each other before this boot-camp. When we started working
together, it was very apparent that each of us was strong at different
things. Some of us are good at hardware and fixing things, some of us are
good at presenting or video editing. Each of us took on a niche role in
the group and leveraged one another’s strengths to work towards a common
goal.”</p>
<h3>Turning failure into opportunity</h3>
<p>At times during the workshop, that common goal—building a functional smart
car—appeared out of reach. For example, Ms Kaitlyn Ng (JC2, Raffles Junior
College) and her team encountered multiple setbacks, burning through not
one, but three motor shields.</p>
<p>Because of this, the group had to head down to Sim Lim Square to obtain
new parts, then learn how to connect those parts using Bluetooth instead
of wi-fi.</p>
<p>“Despite all the challenges along the way, everyone in the group was very
optimistic and patient. Whenever a problem cropped up, we treated it as
an opportunity to learn a new lesson and just dove into it,” Ms Ng said.</p>
<p>Their resilience and determination did not go unnoticed. Ms Ng’s team
bagged both the ‘Best Comeback’ as well as the ‘Fastest Autonomous Car’
award.</p>
<h3>Embodying the ABCs of innovation</h3>
<p>Besides getting hands-on experience, workshop participants also had the
chance to interact with Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, GovTech’s deputy chief executive
and government chief information officer. In his closing address, Mr Chan
highlighted the core values of GovTech—agility, boldness and collaboration—easily
remembered as the acronym ABC.</p>
<p>“In the digital age, agility is important because no university can teach
you enough. In fact, the end of your formal education is only the start
of your journey,” he emphasised. “If you can’t keep learning, adapting
and being agile, chances are you will not survive in this industry.”</p>
<p>On boldness, Mr Chan commended the participants for leaving their comfort
zones and experimenting with a platform—Arduino—that was initially foreign
to them. Finally, he noted how collaboration is crucial to success.</p>
<p>“Because of the way technology cuts across many domains today, even if
you are not doing programming or coding per se, your work will still be
closely related to it. For example, at GovTech we have sociologists and
psychologists helping us with user experience design and even data science,”
he said. “Most of the time, we require more than one team to come together
to work on projects.”</p>
