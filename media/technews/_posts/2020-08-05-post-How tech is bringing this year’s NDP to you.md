<p>You won't be needing one of those coveted National Day Parade tickets
to experience Singapore's birthday celebrations this year.</p>
<p>A reimagined parade will see popular segments taking place in the heartlands,
with digital channels enabling Singaporeans to be a part of festivities
from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>On our end, the GovTech team has been busy building an interactive map
â€“ so that Singaporeans will be able to better enjoy Singapore's 55th birthday
bash from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>Here's how to use it to have the best national day possible. Or at least
in theory.</p>
<h3>Highlight 1: Fireworks, tanks, and flying men - check out where they are!</h3>
<p>No NDP is complete without the parade. The showcase will be dispersed
around Singapore this year. Some of these perennial crowd-pleasers are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Heartland Fireworks Display</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red Lion's Landing Zones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SAF's Mobile Column featuring everyone's favourite military and civil
defence vehicles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://ndp2020.life.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NDP2020 Interactive Map</a>&nbsp;will
be updated with the position of these elements so that you won't miss the
tanks as they rumble by your home or the fireworks display if you live
near one of these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/aug-9-fireworks-to-take-place-at-10-locations-islandwide" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">10 locations</a>.
The elite Red Lions will also be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVO6Cl4eeQg&amp;feature=emb_logo" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">parachuting into the heartlands</a>,
so check out if your neighbourhood is one of the landing sites.</p>
<p>That aside, there are also quite a few fringe activities unique to this
year's celebrations. Use the map to see what's near you. Some of these
include:</p>
<p><strong>Heritage and Culture light up</strong>. 10 national monuments
and arts and cultural institutions will be illuminated in red and white.
Great for pictures!</p>
<p><strong>Museum and Heritage Institution Open House Weekends</strong>.
Great opportunity to take stock of how far we've come â€“ and inspiration
for ideas on how to move forward.</p>
<p><strong>The Flag of Unity. A massive display of over 10,000 Singapore flags</strong>.
This one's at Siloso Beach, so technically, you won't need our map for
it. ðŸ˜‚</p>

<p>You can also post your birthday wish for Singapore on the map (all the
way till 10pm on August 9 2020) and be part of the collective celebrations
all over the country.</p>

<h3>Highlight 2: Get your discounts</h3>
<p>Every Singaporean loves a good bargain, and this year's&nbsp;<a href="https://discounts.life.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NDP discount booklet - featuring over 100 discounts - is going fully digital</a>&nbsp;so
there's no more misplacing those coupons!</p>

</div>
<p>Choose discounts from a wide variety of categories such as food &amp;
beverages, grocery shopping, and local attractions like the Singapore Zoo
and Sentosa.</p>
<p>(For those of you who have our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/www.life.gov.sg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Moments of Life app</a>,
you can also access the discount list there)</p>
<h3>Highlight 3: Connect with fellow Singaporeans through your stories</h3>
<p>2020 has been a year of unprecedented challenges posed by the Covid-19
pandemic. A major component of this year's NDP will capture the voices
of Singaporeans coming together to overcome this hurdle.</p>
<p>Share your reflections on the impact these few months have had and express
your thanks to the frontline and essential workers who are keeping Singapore
ticking during these extraordinary times. These stories and messages of
gratitude can be shared on Facebook or Instagram by using the #OurHeartForSG
hashtag and tagging the NDPeeps accounts or through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndp.gov.sg/ourheartforsg/overview" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Our Heart For SG website</a>.</p>

<h3>Highlight 4: Get featured on the parade's social media!</h3>
<p>Your contribution doesn't have to be in the form of words or photos. Break
out your singing voice and record your rendition of any NDP song or even
an original composition. Your entry might just be shared on NDPeep's YouTube,
Facebook, and Instagram pages.</p>
<p>If singing is not your thing, there's also the Fly Our Flag video that
will be played on August 9. To take part, follow the steps in this&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ndpeeps/video/6852242594542456065" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TikTok video</a>&nbsp;to record your birthday wishes to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Painting the HDB towns red (and white)</h3>
<p>We know what you're thinking: All these high-tech wizardry can't make
up for the fact that there's no large-scale, mass gathering - the only
way we've been doing NDP so far.</p>
<p>Well, we used to think the same about work and offices, too. However,
one of the things we've learned from this COVID-19 episode is that for
many jobs, working from home can be as productive or even more so.</p>
<p>So, give this digital-and-physical hybrid of an NDP to shine.</p>
<p>Who knows, we may have discovered a whole new way to party.</p>
