<p>Whether youâ€™re an Android or iPhone user, no one likes a laggard device.
We have some quick tips on how to keep your handset snappy and responsive.</p>
<p>Right out of the box, new Android and Apple handsets are blazingly fast,
executing each swipe and tap command almost instantaneously. Use them for
long enough, however, and appreciable lag seeps inâ€”terrible if youâ€™re trying
to get work done on the go (worse still if youâ€™re midway through a multiplayer
match on PUBG or League of Legends)!</p>
<p>There are several possible causes of device performance decline but fret
not. Here are some tried-and-tested tips to help you get your mobile phones
working sprightly again.</p>
<h3>For Android phone users</h3>
<h4>1. Remove animations</h4>
<p>Each time you open an app or toggle between screens on your Android phone,
different animations are triggered to create the perception of a smooth
transition to a new page. However, if your phone is lagging, watching these
animations occur in slow motion can be incredibly painful. Hereâ€™s how to
turn them off:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Access â€˜Settingsâ€™&gt; â€˜Systemâ€™&gt; â€˜About phoneâ€™.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on â€˜Build numberâ€™ seven times, and a message will appear informing
you that you have activated â€˜Developer Optionsâ€™.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to the â€˜Systemâ€™ page. â€˜Developer Optionsâ€™ should now be available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down until you see</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>â€˜Window animation scaleâ€™</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>â€˜Transition animation scaleâ€™</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>â€˜Animator duration scaleâ€™</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on each of them and select â€˜Animation offâ€™.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Delete what you donâ€™t need</h4>
<p>In the same way that old furniture and unused items can choke up passageways
in a home and impede movement, pre-installed apps and those that you no
longer use may still run in the background and take up onboard memory,
slowing down your mobile device. Spring cleaning is in order, and hereâ€™s
how you can engage in some digital declutteringâ€”Marie Kondo style.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Access â€˜Settingsâ€™&gt; â€˜Appsâ€™.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go through the list of installed apps until you find one that you no longer
use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select that app, and you will be presented with the option to â€˜Uninstallâ€™
it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have enabled&nbsp;<em>â€˜Developer Optionsâ€™</em>, you have even greater
power to see which app services are running in the background (â€˜<em>System</em>â€™&gt;
â€˜<em>Developer Optionsâ€™</em>&gt; â€˜<em>Running Services</em>â€™). Note down
which unused apps are associated with the running services, then return
to the â€˜<em>App</em>â€™ page to delete them.</p>
<h4>3. Get rid of widgets and live wallpapers</h4>
<p>Convenient as widgets may be to access specific app functions without
opening the app, filling up your phoneâ€™s home screen with them is bound
to result in slower performance and even shorter battery life. This is
because each widget consumes a small amount of processing power, and those
that sync online at regular intervals are even more draining. To delete
a widget, simply tap and hold, then select â€˜<em>Remove</em>â€™.</p>
<p>While youâ€™re busy reorganizing your phoneâ€™s home screen, why not also
switch to a less fancy wallpaper? Live wallpapers with moving elements
in the background may appear pleasing to look at, but they slow down speed
and function. Go to Settings&gt; â€˜<em>Home screen &amp; wallpaper</em>â€™
to switch to a more basic, static one.</p>
<h3>For iPhone users</h3>
<h4>1. Remove animations</h4>
<p>iPhones also use elegant transparency and motion effects to give users
a pleasant visual experience when navigating between screens and apps.
Should your iPhone be slowing down, you can turn these effects off with
the following steps:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Access â€˜<em>Settings</em>â€™&gt; â€˜<em>General</em>â€™&gt; â€˜<em>Accessibility</em>â€™.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down until you see the options</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>â€˜<em>Reduce transparency</em>â€™</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>â€˜<em>Increase contrast</em>â€™</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>â€˜<em>Reduce motion</em>â€™</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toggle on each of the settings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Delete what you donâ€™t need</h4>
<p>Removing unused or unwanted apps is pretty straightforward on the iPhone.
All you need to do is long-press the app icon until an â€˜Xâ€™ appears at the
top left corner of the app. Tapping it will delete the app.</p>
<p>Another method to delete apps is as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Access â€˜<em>Settings</em>â€™&gt; â€˜<em>General</em>â€™&gt; â€˜<em>Usage</em>â€™&gt;
â€˜<em>Manage storage</em>â€™.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select unwanted apps and delete them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Clear your phoneâ€™s RAM</h4>
<p>Hereâ€™s a nifty trick to speed up your iPhone almost immediately without
having to reboot it. First, youâ€™ll need to turn on the â€˜Assistive touchâ€™
function on your phone (â€˜<em>Settings</em>â€™&gt; â€˜<em>General</em>â€™&gt;
â€˜<em>Accessibility</em>â€™&gt; â€˜<em>Assistive touch</em>â€™). This will call
up an assistive touch button that overlays any page.</p>
<p>Next, return to your â€˜<em>General</em>â€™ page and scroll down until you
arrive at the â€˜<em>Shut down</em>â€™ option right at the bottom. Selecting
it will result in a message prompting you to â€˜<em>slide to power off</em>â€™.
Donâ€™t slide it! Instead, tap on the assistive touch button, then press
and hold the on-screen â€˜Homeâ€™ button until the iPhone flashes and you are
taken back to the home screen. Voila! Youâ€™ve just cleared your phoneâ€™s
RAM.</p>
