<h3>Hundreds of public officers took part in the Data Arcade Tournament 2019, the second year running of the visual analytics competition within the Singapore Public Service. </h3>
<h4>The competition concluded with a 5-hour live hackathon with finalist teams presenting their insights that could promote volunteerism and philanthropy in Singapore.</h4>
<p>A picture says a thousand words. This is indeed true with visual analytics.
Rather than overwhelm our audience with paragraphs of text and tables with
multiple rows and columns, visual analytics allows us to tell our stories
and convey our key points clearly and concisely. Visual analytics can be
used in many different ways ‚Äì to explore the data, understand trends and
simulate the impact of changes in policy parameters, monitor key performance
indicators in real-time, or keep track of service standards, etc.</p>
<p>The Data Arcade Tournament is an annual public sector visual analytics
competition organised by the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division
(DSAID) of the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech). Believing
that visual analytics is not difficult to learn and use, the Tournament
is meant to encourage more public officers to start harnessing the power
of data and applying data science knowledge in their daily work. Workshops
were provided for officers who were new to visual analytics, while experienced
officers were encouraged to explore new datasets and convey their insights
in a coherent data story. The strong participation was very encouraging.
Some 600 public officers from 63 agencies formed 144 teams at this year‚Äôs
Data Arcade Tournament.</p>
<p>The Tournament had two rounds. The preliminary round was held between
12 July to 30 September 2019. Tournament participants chose between two
data analytics platforms ‚ÄîQlik Sense and Tableau Desktop. They were allowed
to choose their own open datasets. Out of the 144 teams, the top six teams
(three using Qlik Sense and three using Tableau Desktop) qualified for
the final round held on 4 November 2019. All finalist teams were given
the same dataset only on the competition day itself. They had to process
the data and construct their data stories during a 5-hour Live Hackathon,
akin to an Iron Chef competition where the key ingredient is revealed only
on the spot.</p>
<p>This year, the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) kindly
provided the dataset for the finals using anonymised data drawn from the
portal <a href="http://giving.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">giving.sg</a>.
The teams were encouraged to find insights on how NVPC could grow the pool
of donors and volunteers and how to keep them more active.</p>
<p>TechNews caught up with the winning teams from the Land Transport Authority
(LTA) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to learn about the insights they gleaned
from the datasets and the lessons they learned from using the visual analytics
platforms.</p>
<h3>Causes that matter</h3>
<p>One key judging criterion was whether the teams' analyses produced actionable
outcomes. In this respect, the teams did not disappoint, making several
interesting observations by sifting through records on donor activities
and contributions.</p>
<p>A team of three data analysts and scientist from LTA did an analysis on
the distance of travel to explore if this affected users‚Äô decision to volunteer.
‚ÄúWe found that people were still willing to go the extra mile for the causes
they believe in,‚Äù said Ms Rachel Lim, a member of the LTA team, which emerged
as the overall winner among the users of Tableau. On the same note, NVPC
is also looking to push out location-based volunteerism in its pipeline
to encourage more volunteers to step up.</p>
<p>When asked about the most challenging aspect of the competition, Ms Wang
Hui Xian, also from the LTA team, said that the lack of time had restricted
the depth of the analysis they could conduct. Nonetheless, there may be
opportunities to explore that depth further, as Ms Wang noted that NVPC
has expressed interest in collaborating with her team in the future.</p>

<h3>Many drops make an ocean</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, among the users of Qlik Sense, the team from MOM clinched the
top prize for their analysis of the conversion rates among new, former,
and long-term donors. In their presentation, the team made recommendations
on areas that NVPC could examine to encourage more long-term donors to
stay on this journey of giving.</p>
<p>The team also noted that smaller donations accounted for the majority
of the total donations received by NVPC. ‚ÄúA message we want to bring across
is that it is okay to donate very little, and it is okay to start small.
Every bit of donation adds up in the end,‚Äù said Ms Madeleine Sim, a member
of the MOM team.</p>
<p>Ms Ruth Lee, another member of the MOM team, said that they would use
the experience from the Data Arcade Tournament to delve deeper and explore
the capabilities of data visualisation in their work. ‚ÄúWe may explore data
visualisation as part of the data literacy programme we have been developing
at MOM to empower others to use and work with data more efficiently,‚Äù said
Ms Lee.</p>

<h3>Empowered by data</h3>
<p>Calling the event a success, guest-of-honour Mr Ng Chee Khern, Permanent
Secretary (Smart Nation and Digital Government), lauded the teams and reiterated
the importance of data in Singapore‚Äôs digital transformation efforts.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith the same dataset, the six teams analysed the issues in many different
ways and arrived at many interesting conclusions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI hope that
this event has inspired us all to deepen our knowledge in visual analytics
and to charge ahead in our data science journey, as we need everyone to
work together to transform the public service into one that is digital
and data-driven to the core.‚Äù</p>
<p>All participants of the Data Arcade Tournament received extended trial
use of the respective analytics tools for the purpose of the Tournament.
Grand prizes for the winners include overseas conference tickets for the
Qlik and Tableau conferences to broaden their horizons on the potential
of visual analytics.</p>
