<p>Ask any motorist what their least favourite part of driving is. Chances
are, parking is near the top of that list. The circling around looking
for empty spaces. Ending up parking somewhere really far from your destination.
Forgetting where exactly you parked in the cavernous multi-storey basement
carpark.</p>
<p>Still, at least paying for parking nowadays is pretty convenient, done
either automatically through electronic parking gantries or digitally through
your mobile device. Let‚Äôs take a (road) trip down memory lane to check
out how parking systems have evolved in Singapore through the decades.</p>

over the years.</p>
<h3>Pre-1980s ‚Äì Parking attendants galore</h3>
<p>Information about parking systems before the 1980s is sketchy, probably
because there wasn‚Äôt much thought put into them and not much innovation
going on.</p>
<p>What we do know is that many carparks had parking attendants manning them,
noting the times of arrivals and departures of vehicles entering, and collecting
the requisite parking fees. Motorists would no doubt be fumbling with notes
and coins to pay for their parking while exiting the carpark.</p>
<p>Parking attendants were still prevalent until at least 1982, when the&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/Flipviewer/grid_publish/0/0b6fe76b-9f10-11e7-843a-0050568939ad-Cmd.23of1982/web/html5/index.html?launchlogo=tablet/GovernmentRecords_brandingLogo_.png&amp;pn=31" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Auditor-General‚Äôs Office</a>&nbsp;recommended that productivity could
be boosted and savings made by reducing the number of parking attendants.
How could this be done? By expanding the coupon parking system of course,
something we‚Äôll discuss next.</p>
<h3>1980s ‚Äì Rise of the coupon</h3>
<p>In 1980, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/the-who-what-where-when-and-why-of-public-parking-coupons-in-singapore" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">parking coupon was introduced</a>,
putting the onus of noting the time and duration of parking on drivers
themselves. For the first iteration of parking coupons, drivers had to
shade the date, time and location of their parking spot on the parking
coupon and place them visibly on the dashboard in order to pay for their
parking.</p>
<p>Soon after, the coupons were changed to a punch-and-tear tabs design to
help improve the convenience of drivers. The parking coupons were colourful,
and they represented the various denominations ranging from 50 cents to
4 dollars.</p>
<p>During the first year that coupons were used, HDB and URA carparks used
different sets of coupons, but the coupons were made interchangeable in
1981 after frustrated motorists complained.</p>
<p>While the coupon system worked well and would go on to serve Singapore
for four decades, it had its flaws. For one thing, drivers had to estimate
the duration that they would be parking for and place the corresponding
amount of coupons. If they underestimated the time needed, they would have
to head back to the car just to place more coupons.</p>
<p>And of course, some sneaky drivers would try to cheat the system by folding
the tabs on the coupon instead of tearing them off completely so that they
could reuse it</p>
<p>The coupon system also gave rise to certain quintessentially Singaporean
scenes, such as the coffeeshop assistants bellowing, ‚ÄúSummon aunty lai
liao (here comes the summons attendant)‚Äù, prompting a mad dash of patrons
back to their cars to place coupons.</p>
<h3>2000s ‚Äì Electronic parking</h3>
<p>The drive to replace the parking coupon began in 2004 with the implementation
of the Electronic Parking System (EPS) at some HDB carparks. Electronic
gantries were placed at the carpark entrances and exits, with the gantries
automatically logging the time when the vehicle entered. When the vehicle
wants to exit, the parking fee is deducted from the cash card in the in-vehicle
unit before the gantry is raised.</p>
<p>As an increasing number of HDB carparks were brought into the system,
HDB was able to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/real-time-information-on-hdb-carpark-lots-also-made-available-online" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">release an app in 2014</a>&nbsp;showing
real-time information about available lots in EPS HDB carparks.</p>
<h3>2018 ‚Äì <a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/Flipviewer/grid_publish/0/0b6fe76b-9f10-11e7-843a-0050568939ad-Cmd.23of1982/web/html5/index.html?launchlogo=tablet/GovernmentRecords_brandingLogo_.png&amp;amp;pn=31" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parking.sg</a> is born</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Screenshot of Parking.sg website" src="/images/technews/Parking_sg.jpg">
</div>
<p>But for parking at carparks without the electronic gantries. Coupons continued
to rule the day until 2018, when the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/Flipviewer/grid_publish/0/0b6fe76b-9f10-11e7-843a-0050568939ad-Cmd.23of1982/web/html5/index.html?launchlogo=tablet/GovernmentRecords_brandingLogo_.png&amp;amp;pn=31" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parking.sg</a> 
<a href="https://www.parking.sg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">app</a>&nbsp;was rolled out as part of Singapore‚Äôs Smart Nation initiative.</p>
<p>In the past, you would have had to calculate the number of parking coupons
needed for your parking session. The app will automatically calculate the
charges after you key in your vehicle number, the car park you are parking
at, and the parking duration.</p>
<p>The app will also send a notification to alert drivers 10 minutes before
their parking session expires and give them the option to extend their
parking duration.</p>
<p>And if motorists end their parking session early, a refund is given on
a per minute basis. By&nbsp;<a href="https://vulcanpost.com/656482/parking-sg-app-singapore/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2019</a>,
more than 550,000 unique vehicles and more than 60 per cent of cars had
used <a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/Flipviewer/grid_publish/0/0b6fe76b-9f10-11e7-843a-0050568939ad-Cmd.23of1982/web/html5/index.html?launchlogo=tablet/GovernmentRecords_brandingLogo_.png&amp;amp;pn=31" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parking.sg</a>,
over 15 million parking sessions handled by the app.</p>
<p>The number of parking coupon booklets sold also fell dramatically, with
50,000 sold in Dec 2018, less than one-third of 180,000 sold monthly in
Oct 2017.</p>
<h3>Making a difference in everyday living</h3>
<p>By going from tearing to tapping, parking is now much more convenient.
No more disrupting your meeting to walk back to the car just to place more
coupons. No need to disrupt your coffeeshop lunch because the parking warden
has shown up. And no need to keep a stack of coupons handy and fiddle with
them every time you want to park.</p>
<p>Initiatives like <a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/government_records/Flipviewer/grid_publish/0/0b6fe76b-9f10-11e7-843a-0050568939ad-Cmd.23of1982/web/html5/index.html?launchlogo=tablet/GovernmentRecords_brandingLogo_.png&amp;amp;pn=31" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parking.sg</a> is
what being a Smart Nation is about ‚Äì improving the lives of citizens in
small ways that nonetheless make a tangible difference.</p>
