<p>The Smart Nation Builder exhibition will return to Plaza Singapura from July 26-30.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Smart Nation Builder exhibition at Plaza Singapura with interactive game stations" src="/images/technews/Look_forward_to_fresh_new_experiences_at_Smart_Nation_Builder.jpg"></div><p>Housed within a 12m-long truck, the Smart Nation Builder is a roving exhibition by GovTech that provides an immersive and engaging learning experience for visitors of all ages. Equipped with interactive game stations, you can actively participate in Singapore’s smart nation initiatives and explore digital government services. It is also a platform for citizens to provide input and feedback on how to improve our products and services.</p><p>This year’s Smart Nation Builder introduces some new stations. Read on to find out what they are!</p><h3>Project Pensieve: Detecting dementia early</h3><p>Project Pensieve is a technology-driven initiative launched by the Ministry of Health in Singapore to support the earlier detection of dementia. It’s based on a digital screening tool that uses artificial intelligence to estimate the risk of dementia in seniors in just about 10 minutes. The tool analyses how seniors draw shapes and symbols, and analyses drawings and drawing sequences to determine dementia risk.</p><h3>Keeping your Singpass account secure</h3><p>When it comes to your online accounts, few things are more important than your Singpass account. After all, if someone can gain access to your Singpass, they’ll be privy to a large portion of your life’s details. That’s precisely why this station focuses on keeping your Singpass account safe. Learn practical tips to protect your personal information and navigate the digital landscape with confidence. Enhance your cybersecurity knowledge and stay ahead of potential threats.</p><h3>Unleash your inner innovator at the CrowdTaskSG booth</h3><p>If you love benefitting and contributing to the wisdom of the crowd or sharing your views on government policies, then you’ll love CrowdTaskSG – a newly launched crowdsourcing platform to tap the collective intelligence of Singaporeans. Discover how you can shape Singapore’s future by participating in exciting tasks, from surveys to prototype testing at the CrowdTaskSG booth. And while you’re at it, learn how you can be rewarded for engaging with government agencies.</p><p>Visit our booth, interact with our dynamic team, and see how CrowdTaskSG brings citizens and government closer together.</p><h3>Ageing well at the Smart City Technology Booth</h3><p>By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be over 65. This will have big implications for how our society lives, works and plays. Apart from the physical and cognitive decline that comes with old age, other challenges facing our seniors include social isolation, accessibility, and caregiving needs.</p><p>Find out how Singapore is using tech solutions to ensure our elderly (and our future elderly – present company included) can live independently in their silver years.</p><h3>Avoid taking the bait as a phishing victim</h3><p><a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20230413_police_adv_on_resurgence_of_phishing_scams_involving_malware_to_steal_banking_credentials" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Phishing scams have been on the rise yet again in Singapore</a>&nbsp;– most recently through malware. You might have heard of the case where a lady&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/thorny-situation-woman-buys-durians-online-loses-50k-life-savings-after-downloading-third" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lost her life savings</a>&nbsp;after trying to buy durians online, after downloading a third-party app.</p><p>Perhaps that’s why this station is worth a visit. Here, you can gain valuable insights into identifying and preventing phishing attempts, equipping yourself with essential skills to stay safe online.</p><h3>Fun for the whole family</h3><p>Pics or it didn’t happen? That’s not a problem at Smart Nation Builder. A fan favourite, the photo booth is here to stay. For those with little ones, there are also candy floss and popcorn machines to fulfil any sweet cravings. And if you’re up for some fun, there’s also a claw machine where you can test your luck and win exclusive Smart Nation swag using the points collected from the game stations.</p><h3>Calling all problem solvers</h3><p>Last but not least, Tech Kaki is a community initiative by GovTech Singapore that promotes citizen participation in the evolution of new digital services. Join the Tech Kaki end-user community and you’ll have first dibs on new tech products pre-launch, as well as play a vital role in refining them before they reach everyone else. You can think of it as being part of our beta testing team!</p><p>Sign up to be part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TechKaki" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tech Kaki</a>, and actively contribute to improving our government digital products and services. You might also occasionally get a free kopi on us.</p><p>See you there!</p><p>So, if you’re looking out for activities for the whole family, here’s our pitch to you.
