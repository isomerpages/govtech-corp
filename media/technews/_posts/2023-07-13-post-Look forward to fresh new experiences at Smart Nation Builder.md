<p>Housed within a 12m-long truck, the Smart Nation Builder is a roving exhibition
by GovTech that provides an immersive and engaging learning experience
for visitors of all ages. Equipped with interactive game stations, you
can actively participate in Singapore’s smart nation initiatives and explore
digital government services. It is also a platform for citizens to provide
input and feedback on how to improve our products and services.</p>
<p>This year’s Smart Nation Builder introduces some new stations. Read on
to find out what they are!</p>
<h3>Project Pensieve: Detecting dementia early</h3>
<p>Project Pensieve is a technology-driven initiative launched by the Ministry
of Health in Singapore to support the earlier detection of dementia. It’s
based on a digital screening tool that uses artificial intelligence to
estimate the risk of dementia in seniors in just about 10 minutes. The
tool analyses how seniors draw shapes and symbols, and analyses drawings
and drawing sequences to determine dementia risk.</p>
<h3>Keeping your Singpass account secure</h3>
<p>When it comes to your online accounts, few things are more important than
your Singpass account. After all, if someone can gain access to your Singpass,
they’ll be privy to a large portion of your life’s details. That’s precisely
why this station focuses on keeping your Singpass account safe. Learn practical
tips to protect your personal information and navigate the digital landscape
with confidence. Enhance your cybersecurity knowledge and stay ahead of
potential threats.</p>
<h3>Unleash your inner innovator at the CrowdTaskSG booth</h3>
<p>If you love benefitting and contributing to the wisdom of the crowd or
sharing your views on government policies, then you’ll love CrowdTaskSG
– a newly launched crowdsourcing platform to tap the collective intelligence
of Singaporeans. Discover how you can shape Singapore’s future by participating
in exciting tasks, from surveys to prototype testing at the CrowdTaskSG
booth. And while you’re at it, learn how you can be rewarded for engaging
with government agencies.</p>
<p>Visit our booth, interact with our dynamic team, and see how CrowdTaskSG
brings citizens and government closer together.</p>
<h3>Ageing well at the Smart City Technology Booth</h3>
<p>By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be over 65. This will have big
implications for how our society lives, works and plays. Apart from the
physical and cognitive decline that comes with old age, other challenges
facing our seniors include social isolation, accessibility, and caregiving
needs.</p>
<p>Find out how Singapore is using tech solutions to ensure our elderly (and
our future elderly – present company included) can live independently in
their silver years.</p>
<h3>Avoid taking the bait as a phishing victim</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20230413_police_adv_on_resurgence_of_phishing_scams_involving_malware_to_steal_banking_credentials" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Phishing scams have been on the rise yet again in Singapore</a>&nbsp;–
most recently through malware. You might have heard of the case where a
lady&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/thorny-situation-woman-buys-durians-online-loses-50k-life-savings-after-downloading-third" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lost her life savings</a>&nbsp;after
trying to buy durians online, after downloading a third-party app.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why this station is worth a visit. Here, you can gain valuable
insights into identifying and preventing phishing attempts, equipping yourself
with essential skills to stay safe online.</p>
<h3>Fun for the whole family</h3>
<p>Pics or it didn’t happen? That’s not a problem at Smart Nation Builder.
A fan favourite, the photo booth is here to stay. For those with little
ones, there are also candy floss and popcorn machines to fulfil any sweet
cravings. And if you’re up for some fun, there’s also a claw machine where
you can test your luck and win exclusive Smart Nation swag using the points
collected from the game stations.</p>
<h3>Calling all problem solvers</h3>
<p>Last but not least, Tech Kaki is a community initiative by GovTech Singapore
that promotes citizen participation in the evolution of new digital services.
Join the Tech Kaki end-user community and you’ll have first dibs on new
tech products pre-launch, as well as play a vital role in refining them
before they reach everyone else. You can think of it as being part of our
beta testing team!</p>
<p>Sign up to be part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TechKaki" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tech Kaki</a>,
and actively contribute to improving our government digital products and
services. You might also occasionally get a free kopi on us.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking out for activities for the whole family, here’s
