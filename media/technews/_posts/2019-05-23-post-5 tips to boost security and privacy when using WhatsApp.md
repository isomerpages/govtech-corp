<h3>A recent vulnerability in WhatsAppâ€™s voice call function has raised concerns over security and privacy on the popular messaging platform. </h3>
<h3>We highlight some settings you can toggle to give you greater peace of mind when using WhatsApp.</h3>
<p>Unless youâ€™ve been on a self-imposed digital detox, you probably would
have heard by now about a critical security flaw in WhatsApp that allows
hackers to install spyware via the appâ€™s voice call function. For the tech
geeks out there, the hackers exploited what is known as a buffer overflow
vulnerability in WhatsAppâ€™s voice-over-internet protocol; when the volume
of data passing through the app exceeds that of its allocated temporary
storage space, the excess data spills over into adjacent storageâ€”a foothold
for spyware installation.</p>
<p>Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, has not confirmed how many of its 1.5 billion
usersâ€™ privacy may have been compromised in this latest digital faux pas.
Nonetheless, if you havenâ€™t already done so, be sure to update WhatsApp
to patch the vulnerability. While youâ€™re at it, also check out the following
tips to give you greater peace of mind when using WhatsApp.</p>
<h3>1. Double confirm that your chats and calls are encrypted</h3>
<p>By default, WhatsApp provides end-to-end encryption of messages and calls
between its users. This means that only you and the person youâ€™re contacting
are privy to the content being transmitted over the app. To check whether
this function is indeed enabled on your phone, select a conversation and
tap on the contactâ€™s name. You will see an â€˜Encryptionâ€™ option. Select
it, and youâ€™ll be presented with a QR code with the instruction to â€˜Scan
the code on your contactâ€™s phone, or ask them to scan your code to verify
that the messages and calls with them are end-to-end encrypted.â€™</p>
<h3>2. Enable two-step verification</h3>
<p>We canâ€™t emphasise this enoughâ€”if an app has an option for two-factor
authentication, enable it. To activate this function on WhatsApp, go to
your WhatsApp settings page, select â€˜Accountâ€™, and turn on â€˜Two-step verificationâ€™.
Whenever you (or someone else) try to register your phone number with WhatsApp
again, a six-digit PIN code will be required before registration can be
completed. This helps ensure that only you have access to your account.</p>
<h3>3. Double blue ticks are gone</h3>
<p>When WhatsApp first introduced the â€˜double blue ticksâ€™ feature back in
2014, the feature polarised users into two campsâ€”some loved the sense of
accountability it imposed, while others found it to be an intrusion of
privacy. Fortunately, you donâ€™t have to put up with the double blue ticks
if you donâ€™t want to. Simply go to your privacy settings in WhatsApp and
turn off â€˜Read receiptsâ€™. This works both ways, so while your contacts
wonâ€™t be able to know if youâ€™ve read their messages, you wonâ€™t be able
to know if theyâ€™ve read yours either. However, bear in mind that you canâ€™t
disable read receipts in group chats.</p>
<h3>4. Toggle media auto-download settings</h3>
<p>If your contacts are over-enthusiastic about sending multimedia messages,
including pictures and videos, over WhatsApp, you may want to disable your
auto-download function to avoid running out of data and memory on your
mobile device. Go to your settings and select â€˜Data and storage usageâ€™.
Once there, you can select the types of files that will be downloaded automatically
on WhatsApp, which are customisable for whether you have internet access
via mobile data or Wi-Fi. If youâ€™re overseas with limited mobile data,
youâ€™ll definitely want to turn off all media downloads to avoid racking
up a huge bill at the end of your holiday.</p>
<h3>5. Back up your messages</h3>
<p>So youâ€™ve just purchased a new phone and installed WhatsApp on it. To
your horror, all the conversations from your previous phone have been lost!
Hereâ€™s how you can avoid being caught in such an unfortunate situation.
Under WhatsApp settings, youâ€™ll find a â€˜Chatsâ€™ tab that allows you to set
up a Google Drive account to save your chats. If youâ€™re worried about running
out of mobile data, you can choose the frequency of backups and only allow
the app to sync with the cloud over a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
