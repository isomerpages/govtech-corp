<p><em>What have you done to secure your smartphone? PHOTO: <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/man-in-row-with-bank-over-hacked-phone" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UNSPLASH.COM</a></em>
</p>
<p>But what have you done recently to secure your smartphone or tablet? This
a device that contains info that is equally, if not more sensitive than
the contents of our personal computers. For some of us, our entire lives
live on our smartphones.</p>
<p>As the usage of mobile devices continues to rise, hackers are now turning
their attention to attacking smartphones and tablets with malicious software
and malware.</p>
<p>Here are some simple guidelines to keep these cyber-attackers away.</p>
<h3>1. Only install and run apps from official app stores</h3>
<p>In 2016, a Singaporean man received a mysterious prompt for a system update
on his android smartphone. The consequences were painful.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/man-in-row-with-bank-over-hacked-phone" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Hackers got hold of his credit card details</a>&nbsp;and
made six flight tickets purchases in his name ‚Äì totalling up to a whopping
$12,327.</p>
<p>If this episode teaches us anything, it‚Äôs the reason why Google Play and
the Apple App Store exist ‚Äì quality control.</p>
<p>Apps and ‚Äòupdates‚Äô from non-official app stores do not go through stringent
malware checks and thus pose greater security risks. By bypassing the app
stores, you‚Äôre forgoing a crucial level of security screening. Not advisable.</p>
<h3>2. Enable Anti-Malware!</h3>
<p>In 2019, there were hundreds of malicious apps on the Google Play store
containing&nbsp;<a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-hundreds-of-android-apps-containing-dresscode-malware-hiding-in-google-play-store.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">‚ÄòDressCode‚Äô</a>,
a malware which infected over 400 apps there.</p>
<p>What this tells us is that even if apps are indeed on the app store, you
can‚Äôt count on them to be completely safe ‚Äì even the most stringent of
checks can sometimes be slipped past.</p>
<p>To avoid such situations, anti-malware such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-check-your-android-phone-for-malicious-apps/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google Play Protect</a>&nbsp;can
be enabled to scan apps before downloading, as well as updates before they
are installed.</p>
<h3>3. Update your apps and operating systems (OS) regularly</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs annoying to give your phone some downtime, but trust us, they need
it.</p>
<p>Smartphone OS updates carry security patches to defend against newly discovered
vulnerabilities, so do keep your OS version updated in a timely manner.
You don‚Äôt install those updates at your own risk.</p>
<h3>4. Do not ‚Äúroot‚Äù or ‚Äújailbreak‚Äù your device</h3>
<p>Jailbreaking phones seems like a great idea as it removes a lot of strict
security settings, so you can install whatever you want on it.</p>
<p>On the flip side, removing those strict security settings‚Ä¶well is removing
those strict security settings ‚Äì and increasing the risk of attackers gaining
control of your device.</p>
<h3>5. Use trusted USB charging points</h3>
<p>It might seem a little paranoid, but yes, please don‚Äôt go around plugging
your phone into USB charging stations indiscriminately ‚Äì you might be compromising
your security.</p>
<p>Experts call this ‚Äòjuice hacking‚Äô ‚Äì hackers can secretly copy files or
install malicious software in your phone. And lest you think this will
take a while,&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/charging-your-phone-using-a-public-usb-port-beware-of-juice-jacking-130947" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">60 seconds is all the hackers need.</a>
</p>
<p>If necessary, consider plugging a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3454899/traveling-this-7-gadget-protects-your-phone-from-treacherous-usb-charging-ports.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">USB Data Blocker</a>&nbsp;between
your device and the charging port as a security measure against risks of
infecting your device with malware.</p>
<p>Otherwise, just carry a good old power bank around.</p>
<h3>6. Avoid public/untrusted WiFi connections</h3>
<p>Tempted to join that password free public WiFi? Stop right there. This
might be bait for someone trying to hack you.</p>
<p>Because traffic on public WiFi connections can be easily intercepted,
attackers can modify data sent and install malware on your device.</p>
<p>The solution here? Use a trusted Public WiFi network (such as Wireless@SG)
or create a hotspot via your smartphone.</p>
<h3>7. Do not click links from unknown emails</h3>
<p>Sending an email with a malicious link is one of the oldest tricks in
the hacker‚Äôs book. They‚Äôll get you to click in by using attention grabbing
email subjects, or even impersonate people you might know.</p>
<p>With this click, malware can find their way into your device. So do not
open that email if you think the source of the message is dodgy!</p>
<h3>Just like in real life, cyber hygiene is important</h3>
<p>These tips might seem almost too easy to be of any use, but the truth
is that keeping safe from hackers is a lot like maintaining good habits.
You don‚Äôt need complex or complicated ways to ward off most hackers ‚Äì what
you need is consistency.</p>
