  fatherhood. Learn their tips for achieving harmony this Father's Day!
variant: tiptap

<p>Once upon a time, dads were not expected to be as involved in their children‚Äôs
upbringing as moms. Today, however, fathers are much more hands-on and
taking on more domestic duties. The work-from-home arrangement in the last
year or so has also given working dads more time to spend with their kids.</p>
<p>This Father‚Äôs Day, let‚Äôs hear from three dads ‚Äì Loh Shi Wei, Eden Seah
and Mehul Shah ‚Äì on how they juggle their public service careers with their
role as fathers.</p>

</p>
<h3>First off, tell us more about what you do at GovTech?</h3>
<p><strong>Shi Wei:</strong>&nbsp;Both Eden and I belong to the Services
Group, which means we are GovTechies that are deployed to other government
agencies to help build up their ICT systems and capabilities. I‚Äôm the Agency
Chief Information Security Officer (ACISO) at the Singapore Land Authority
(SLA). I oversee the information security management of the agency and
am also responsible for the planning, development and implementation of
information security strategies and policies in line with regulatory requirements
and whole-of-government direction.</p>
<p><strong>Eden:</strong>
</p>
<p>I sit at the Ministry of Education (MOE) as an Application Infrastructure
Engineer and handle ICT and cybersecurity governance. Mostly I will review
MOE‚Äôs IT systems and environment and provide advice on protecting systems
and data against cyber and internal threats.</p>
<p><strong>Mehul:</strong>
</p>
<p>I am a Manager in Government Digital Services division ‚Äì the team that
creates many digital services and products for our citizens and businesses
in Singapore. I help the team with product marketing and engagement for
TraceTogether. I also support internal communications efforts within the
division. Since earlier in the year, I‚Äôve been picking up UX (User-Experience)
design as well, on the HealthCerts project.</p>
<h3>How would you describe yourself as a father?</h3>
<p><strong>Eden:</strong>&nbsp;I‚Äôve only become a father last year; my daughter
is now 8 months old. Since becoming a father, I feel a deep yearning to
see my daughter every day and watch her grow.</p>
<p><strong>Shi Wei:</strong>&nbsp;I think I‚Äôm a chill father as I allow my
children the room and space to explore and learn new things at their own
pace rather than worrying if they are lagging behind other kids of the
same age group.</p>
<p><strong>Mehul:</strong>&nbsp;Apart from the typical guidance role, I enjoy
being his friend and partner-in-crime in cheeky or crazy activities! My
son‚Äôs a ball of fun, and spending time with him energises me.</p>
<h3>Has your role as a dad changed since Covid-19 struck and work from home began? How have your teammates supported you during this time?</h3>
<p><strong>Shi Wei:</strong>&nbsp;I do not see much changes to my role as
a father except that I am spending more time at home and am able to witness
my children‚Äôs growing up milestones. The pandemic has given me the opportunity
to bond with my children more, which is something I am grateful for. It
has been a trying time for everyone, but I am grateful to my bosses and
teammates for their support during the times when I needed to take some
time out to take care of my children when they were unwell and could not
attend school. They have been very understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Mehul:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with Shi Wei, my teammates and bosses
have also been very understanding during this period. I am very grateful
for that!</p>
<p><strong>Eden:</strong>&nbsp;My daughter was born when COVID-19 struck.
Work from home became the new norm and I had the opportunity to spend more
time with my daughter. Like Shi Wei, I see this as a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>My teammates have been very supportive and reassuring. They give me the
confidence to take time off to look after my daughter when needed as they
help to cover some of my duties.</p>
<h3>What‚Äôs a typical day like for you when working from home? And do you struggle with balancing full-time work with giving your kids daily attention?</h3>
<p><strong>Mehul:</strong>&nbsp;I start my day by helping my boy get ready
before sending him to playgroup. I would then return home to start planning
out the tasks to work on for the day prior to meetings or checking emails.</p>
<p>It isn‚Äôt that hard to balance work and my kid because he‚Äôs in playgroup
most of the time on weekdays. However, if he‚Äôs at home, then it‚Äôs about
prioritising less urgent tasks for later and spending that time with him
to play or keeping him company as he plays. Sometimes I have to remind
myself while working to cherish those fleeting moments with him as he grows
up fast!</p>
<p><strong>Shi Wei:</strong>&nbsp;I start my day at 7.30am in the morning
to prepare my elder son for school and will send him to school by 8.30am.
I will then have a quick bite and start my workday. Lunch break is spent
with my wife (who is also working from home). I will typically stop my
work at about 6pm to pick up my elder son from school and have a good dinner
with my family at about 7pm. I devote the remaining time to my family after
that before helping the kids to bed at about 10pm.</p>
<p>While this sounds neat and organised, in all honesty, it can be really
challenging at times, especially if my elder son is at home. He will tend
to come into my room where I work and ask me to play with him. In such
instances, if possible, I will take about 15 minutes off my work and give
him some attention before resuming my work.</p>
<p><strong>Eden:</strong>&nbsp;I will be working alongside my wife in the
study room during working hours, while sneaking in some time during work
to have small chats and play with my daughter. After work hours, I usually
spend the rest of the evening with my wife and daughter over dinner and
more playtime.</p>
<p>It must be hard for my daughter to be away from her parents during the
day when she is most active and wanting to spend time with us. At times
we can hear her crawling to the door and knocking it as if she is calling
out to us.</p>
<h3>Sounds like quite a handful to handle. Do you take ‚Äúme time‚Äù? If so, what do you enjoy doing?</h3>
<p><strong>Eden:</strong>&nbsp;I do evening runs or high-intensity workout
sessions. I also enjoy watching Japanese anime and shows on Netflix.</p>
<p><strong>Shi Wei:</strong>&nbsp;I definitely do ‚Äúme time‚Äù! It is important
to have ‚Äúme time‚Äù as a way of relieving stress and staying sane, more so
during this pandemic. It is also a way to recharge and refresh my mind
and gather my thoughts. I enjoy building something out of Lego and playing
games on my mobile during this time.</p>
<p><strong>Mehul:</strong>&nbsp;My favourite time of the day is when I get
to relax with lo-fi music. Recently, I have also been enjoying outdoor
walks with friends.</p>
<h3>You guys seem to have it all together. Any top tips for your fellow fathers to achieve balance of work and kids?</h3>
<p><strong>Mehul:</strong>&nbsp;I‚Äôll share a quick story; there was one time
my son was going through a reel of washi tape while I was on call. He was
sticking it on himself, the walls, all around the house! He somehow also
has the uncanny timing of coming into the room whenever I am in a call.
There are highs and lows of fatherhood, but it is important to appreciate
all these moments and make time for their growing up years.</p>
<p><strong>Eden:</strong>&nbsp;As a new father, I think balance can be achieved
with supportive family and a wife who shares the difficulties and joys
of raising our kids. To all the dads out there, share the Father‚Äôs Day
happiness with your wife who is also juggling both work and raising our
children.</p>
<p><strong>Shi Wei:</strong>&nbsp;Not sure if these are top tips, but they
work for me. One, always make time for the little things, such as having
meals together with the kids (without the distractions of the phone/tablets)
and everyday interactions, such as sending them to and picking them up
from school. Two, know what‚Äôs truly urgent and important. Work can be urgent
and important, but your kids‚Äô growing-up milestones are just equally important.
Once you miss those milestones, you will never have them back again.</p>
<h3>Finally, what are the joys that being a father brings to you?</h3>
<p><strong>Mehul:</strong>&nbsp;Watching him grow, discover and learn new
activities or skills. The fact that you would feel instantaneously refreshed
to see him even after a seemingly tiring day.</p>
<p><strong>Eden:</strong>&nbsp;I guess every parent melts at their children‚Äôs
smiles. My joy comes from my daughter‚Äôs smiles and giggles whenever she
sees me walking out of the study room.</p>
<p><strong>Shi Wei:</strong>&nbsp;Seeing my kids grow up healthily and happy.
The smiles on their faces can really make me forget about any stress or
troubles that I am facing.</p>
<p><em>Kudos to all fathers who wear many hats in their daily lives and for keeping a strong front before their families and colleagues. A good support system is important, and we hope that you have found time for yourself and enjoy the special moment you currently share with your children. Happy Father‚Äôs Day!</em>
