<h3>SupplyAlly, or Sally for short, is a mobile app that facilitates the process of logistics distribution, especially in times of need during COVID-19 and the post-COVID era.</h3>
<p>How did Sally come about? It started with a phone call on April 1st.</p>
<p>Steven Koh, Director of Government Digital Services at GovTech, received
a call from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Peopleâ€™s Association
(PA). They wanted to know if GovTech could develop an app that would digitalise
the nationwide reusable mask distribution exercise.</p>
<p>When was the distribution exercise going to start? April 5th came the
reply. In the span of four days, GovTech engineers repurposed and refined
an existing application into SupplyAlly. We had to develop an app that
was designed with a low barrier to entry for users, as we did not know
how many people were involved in distributing masks. We also developed
a form of authorisation and authentication that was scalable with the size
of the volunteer efforts.</p>

<p>Given the time constraints, speed was a major consideration â€“ what are
the essential steps for using this app, and what is the most basic way
of verifying identities? These were key concerns for the team as we worked
round the clock to meet the deadline.</p>
<h3>A helping hand for the community</h3>
<p>Once we set Sally up, MTI and the PA were able to distribute reusable
masks across Singapore through the various community centres. To date,
4.2 million masks have been issued through this campaign.</p>
<p>Once we saw how successful Sally was after the mask distribution, we realised
that there was great potential for Sally to support charitable efforts
in Singapore. During the Circuit Breaker period, home-based learning was
implemented, but some children could not participate because they lacked
access to internet laptops. Thatâ€™s when we decided to partner Engineering
Good to distribute refurbished laptops to underprivileged students for
home-based learning.</p>
<p>Since June, weâ€™ve also worked with the Community Development Council (CDC)
and PA to distribute voucher booklets to families in need - Sally is utilised
to distribute vouchers to more than 250,000 households out of 400,000 eligible
households.</p>
<p>Sally also directly contributes to the national contact tracing effort
against COVID-19. Together with our parent organisation, the Smart Nation
and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) and the Agency for Integrated Careâ€™s
(AIC) Silver Generation Office, more than 10,000 TraceTogether (TT) tokens
were issued to the elderly who do not own smartphones and other digitally-excluded
members of the population. Subsequently, in September, we started the distribution
of TT tokens at the Community Clubs in Jalan Besar and Tanjong Pagar areas.</p>
<p>More recently, we engaged Food from the Heart, a charitable organisation
and gave out hot meals to the elderly and other service users around the
Mountbatten area. Sally vastly simplified the process of tracking and recording
items distributed, ensuring equitable distribution of essentials for individuals
and households.</p>
<h3>Technology, the driving force behind Sally</h3>
<p>By utilising cloud technologies on our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-commercial-cloud" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government Commercial Cloud</a>&nbsp;framework,
Sally is able to run different distribution campaigns simultaneously with
the use of unique QR codes at an effective cost model. In addition, by
staying true to our DNA, we are able to significantly lower the lead time
required to roll out new campaigns by leveraging reusable components.</p>
