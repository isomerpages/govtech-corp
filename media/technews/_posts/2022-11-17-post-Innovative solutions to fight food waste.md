<p>Singapore is known as a food paradise, a melting pot of the best that
Western and Eastern cuisines have to offer. A less savoury fact about food
in Singapore is that food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in
the country, making up over 10 per cent of all waste produced here.</p>
<p>Singaporeans have also grown more wasteful, with the amount of food waste
generated increasing by about 20 per cent over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Such wasteful habits have a high impact on the food security of Singapore,
which imports over 90 per cent of its food supply. In addition, resources
such as incinerators and landfills are used to process food waste, resulting
in a higher carbon footprint.</p>
<p>To tackle this issue, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment
introduced the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.towardszerowaste.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Year Towards Zero Waste</a>&nbsp;campaign
in 2019 to encourage Singaporeans to adopt practices that minimise the
amount of food they throw away. Since then, many initiatives have been
launched to address the problem.</p>
<p>Here are some of the innovative solutions leveraging technology and the
principles of redistribution, upcycling, and reduction, to reduce food
waste.</p>
<h3>Redistribution â€“ cleaning out the buffet with Treatsure</h3>
<p>Buffets have long been a dining favourite here, but also a big source
of food waste. Local Startup Treatsure is trying to change that by enabling
consumers to purchase leftover buffet food for as little as $10. The Treatsure
app shows users where buffets are about to end at partners such as the
Grand Hyatt Hotel and Hotel Jen.</p>
<p>If one of the locations catches your fancy, head down and make payment
through the Treatsure app. Youâ€™ll receive a Treasure box that you can fill
at the buffet line.</p>
<h3>Redistribution â€“ Food rescuers to the rescue</h3>
<p>The concept of food rescuing revolves around collecting surplus food before
theyâ€™re thrown away and redistributing them.</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;<a href="https://volunteer.foodrescue.sg/livc.php" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">several</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.frc.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">food</a>&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/foodrescuesk/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">rescue</a>&nbsp;groups in Singapore that you can be a part of. For instance,
the Little India Veggie Collection runs twice a week. Volunteers approach
shopkeepers for their unsellable vegetables that would otherwise be thrown
away. These are distributed among the food rescuers for their own consumption.</p>
<p>Another group in Sengkang collects unsold excess food â€“ including fruits,
vegetables, and bread â€“ islandwide to give to the community.</p>
<h3>Upcycling â€“ food waste to anti-bacterial material</h3>
<p>Technology now allows us to upcycle or repurpose food waste into other
useful products.</p>
<p>One example of this is the work done by the Food Science and Technology
Programme at Nanyang Technological University to transform&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biospectrumasia.com/news/54/18443/singapore-based-medtech-startup-converts-cashew-waste-into-an-organic-anti-microbe-solution.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">cashew waste</a>&nbsp;into
a long-lasting antibacterial material that is effective against 99 per
cent of viruses and bacteria, including the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>The antimicrobial compound has also been incorporated into surface disinfectants
and sanitisers available in supermarkets. Anti-bacterial face masks that
all households in Singapore received during the pandemic also used the
same material.</p>
<p>Previously, the same team developed an environmentally friendly cling
wrap made out of chitosan, which is primarily derived from shellfish.</p>
<h3>Upcycling â€“ farming insects using food waste</h3>
<p>Flies are commonly seen as pests, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insectta.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Insectta</a>&nbsp;â€“
the first urban insect farm in Singapore â€“ raises flies, the black soldier
fly specifically, for a variety of uses.</p>
<p>The farm gathers food waste from landfills, beer breweries, and grocery
stores. The flies that are bred can be made into valuable biomaterials
such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insectta.com/biomaterials" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">chitosan</a>, which has pharmaceutical
and cosmetic applications.</p>
<p>Other products from the farm include black soldier fly larvae, which can
be used as pet feed and organic black soldier fly fertiliser for plants.</p>
<h3>Upcycling â€“ brewing up a second life for food waste</h3>
<p>Want to do something good while having a drink? Then Crust Group's products
are just the thing for you.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, the social enterprise sells beers and non-alcoholic beverages
made from surplus bread and other ingredients. Some of the products include
Kaya Toast Stout and naturally-essenced sparkling fruit water made from
fruit waste.</p>
<p>The Crust Group works with restaurants, hotels, and food retail outlets
such as RedMart, Tiong Bahru Bakery, SaladStop, and Bettr Barista to get
surplus and waste products.</p>
<h3>Upcycling â€“ using up every bit of fruit</h3>
<p>Singapore incinerates about 20,000 tonnes of fruit waste every year. Much
of this is generated by the fruit juicing industry, which uses just 50
per cent of fruits while disposing of the rest as unwanted by-products
such as fruit peels and pulp.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uglygood.com.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UglyGood</a>&nbsp;harvests fruit waste
and transforms it into raw materials for new products. These include feed
for livestock, natural cleaning solutions, and essential oils.</p>
<h3>Reduction â€“ optimising food use through big data</h3>
<p>Weâ€™ve heard a lot about the impact of big data and itâ€™s making a difference
in the fight against food waste as well.</p>
<p>A company called&nbsp;<a href="https://lumitics.com/about/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lumitics</a>&nbsp;is
working with commercial kitchens to reduce their food waste, cost, and
environmental footprint through data analytics and business intelligence.</p>
<p>Using a combination of image recognition, artificial intelligence, and
data analytics, Lumitics provides insights into what is being thrown away
by the kitchens.</p>
<p>Armed with that knowledge, the kitchen management is then able to make
adjustments and optimise their kitchen practices to minimise wastage and
costs.</p>
<h3>Everyone can do their part</h3>
<p>As consumers of food, we can do our part as well to reduce wastage. Simple
steps, such as planning our grocery runs properly so that we donâ€™t end
up buying too much food that we canâ€™t finish, go a long way.</p>
<p>Many of us are also picky about the food we buy, choosing only the most
pristine fruits and vegetables and avoiding those with the slightest blemish
even though they are still entirely edible.</p>
<h4>Technology may be having a big impact on the fight against food waste, but human action is still essential to turning the tide.</h4>
