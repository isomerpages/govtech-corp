<p>TL:DR: Football is not the only sport that taps data, research and innovation
to improve athlete performance. Coaches and athletes in other sports are
also turning to technology to get a leg up in international competitions.
We look at how video-based analytics and a 3D motion capture system are
helping Singapore’s athletes train better and smarter. Ultimately, a multidisciplinary
approach is needed to support our athletes in their quest for sporting
excellence.</p>
<hr>
<p>Perhaps the World Cup is not your cup of tea. Or maybe you just don’t
get a kick out of team sports and the technologies that support them. The
good news is, football is not the only sport that taps data, research and
innovation to improve athlete performance. TechNews spoke to Mr Luqman
Aziz, a biomechanist at Sport Singapore, on how technology can be used
to support our sporting talents in their training and at international
competitions.</p>
<p>“We are athlete-centric but coach-driven as well. In terms of the demands
of the sport, the coaches know what they want. Then we [the biomechanists
and sports scientists] come in as a group with the technologies to help
them achieve their goals,” said Mr Aziz. “The most important thing that
technology has done is help us make objective, evidence-based decisions
for our athletes.”</p>
<h3><strong>Making sense of movement</strong></h3>
<p>Motion is the defining trait of virtually any sport. Being able to capture,
measure and analyse the movement of the human body is the first step towards
refining it. Portable and high-resolution video cameras are thus becoming
critical assets at sports competitions.</p>

<p><em>Dartfish dashboard for video analysis</em>
</p>
<p>“We use a lot of video-based analysis during silat competitions,” Mr Aziz
noted, highlighting the martial art form indigenous to Southeast Asia that
has gained international traction. “The coach will identify critical opponents
participating in the tournament, and what I’ll do is make a video recording
of their matches. After that, we analyse the video recording using a performance
analysis system called Dartfish.”</p>
<p>Using Dartfish, every action—a punch, a kick, a counterattack—that takes
place during a silat match is tagged. When reviewing all the tags, patterns
emerge, revealing the behaviours and strategies of competitors.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, we want to gather descriptive statistics of what
transpired during a competition. We are then able to provide feedback to
the coaches or athletes to help them modify their competition tactics,”
Mr Aziz explained.</p>
<p>But video-based performance analysis can also be used to directly measure
athletes’ proficiencies. For example, Mr Aziz highlighted how he leverages
video recordings to track sprinters’ running speeds at 20-metre intervals,
building their velocity profiles during 100-metre races. This data helps
coaches and athletes identify weaknesses, as well as gauge how effective
training programmes are.</p>
<h3><strong>Progress in another dimension</strong></h3>
<p>While video recordings in two dimensions are useful, three-dimensional
(3D) motion capture technology can yield even more accurate information
about an athlete’s movements. Such fine-grained insights are especially
important in sports like kayaking, where the technical precision of each
repetitive motion matters.</p>

<p>“In a kayaking stroke, the coach may demand that the athlete bends his
or her elbow at a particular angle,” said Mr Aziz. “Using a 3D motion analysis
system, we are able to automatically measure this angle at every phase
of the stroke.”</p>
<p>Here’s how it’s done: the athlete is first made to wear reflective markers
on the shoulder, elbow and wrist. These markers are tracked in real time
by the 3D motion capture system. Any changes in the positions of these
three markers will result in changes in the angle of the elbow joint. Mr
Aziz noted that Hollywood moviemakers use the same technology to create
animated characters—think Gollum from The Lord of the Rings and Caesar
from Planet of the Apes. Sports science has simply adapted it for athletes,
not actors.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, a good stroke could be programmed to trigger a beeping sound,
so not only do the athletes receive visual feedback by looking at the graphs,
but they also can rely on auditory cues to improve their performance. Some
athletes are visual learners, while others are kinaesthetic or auditory
learners, so we customise the system to suit their preferences,” said Mr
Aziz.</p>
<h3><strong>No ‘I’ in team</strong></h3>
<p>For the most part, the response from coaches and athletes to these new
technologies has been positive, said Mr Aziz. Importantly, coaches are
convinced that the evidence gathered through video-based analytics and
3D motion capture are complementing conventional training regimes.</p>
<p>“The crucial thing is to explain to the coaches that what we are recommending
is based on past research—we’re not doing things just for the sake of doing
them,” said Mr Aziz, adding that Sport Singapore works closely with the
National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University,
Singapore on research projects relating to biomechanics and sports science.</p>
<p>He emphasised that a multidisciplinary approach is critical when it comes
to creating solutions to help our athletes train better and smarter. “We
engage with experts in mechanical, aerospace and computer engineering to
help us develop the hardware and software we need. So we craft the questions,
and then ask the scientists and engineers to put together the technology
and give us feedback on whether they think our ideas are feasible,” he
said.</p>
<p>With so many parties working behind the scenes to support athletes in
their quest for sporting excellence, the definition of a team sport may
need an update. But one thing is certain—technology is changing the sporting
landscape, and to stay in the race, one must be willing to embrace it.</p>
