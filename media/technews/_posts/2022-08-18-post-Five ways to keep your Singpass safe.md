<p>Did you know that Singpass is almost 20 years old? Launched in 2003 (the
same year Cristiano Ronaldo made his first Manchester United debut), Singpass
has come a long way from being a login to transact with the government
to become an all-encompassing digital identity with its own feature-packed
mobile application. Its security has also been constantly enhanced, such
as when Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) was introduced in 2015.</p>
<p>With more transactions conducted online and scams continuously evolving,
user vigilance is as crucial as the technical and operational safeguards
put in place. Read on to learn more about these five security tips and
how you can play an active role in keeping your Singpass secure.</p>
<p><strong>Five ways to keep your Singpass safe:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Don't share your Singpass details with others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't click on hyperlinks or scan QR codes sent over SMS or WhatsApp by
"Singpass"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the Singpass URL domain carefully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't ignore the alert about an unusual login</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only one active Singpass app at a time</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Don't share your Singpass details with others</h3>
<p>Do you know that Singpass can be used to access thousands of government
and private sector services, and it contains a lot of your personal information?</p>
<p>Just as you would not hand over your physical identity card to just about
anyone, you should not disclose your Singpass ID, password and 2FA details
to others.</p>
<p>You should also register only your own biometric information on your mobile
device. Don‚Äôt allow strangers to use your device and potentially gain access
to your Singpass app!</p>
<h3>2. Don‚Äôt click on hyperlinks or scan QR codes sent over SMS or WhatsApp by ‚ÄúSingpass‚Äù</h3>

</div>
<p>Singpass does not send hyperlinks or QR codes over SMS or social messaging
apps such as WhatsApp. So never click on the hyperlinks or scan the QR
codes if you receive such a message.</p>
<p>As an added layer of security, the Singpass app is programmed to recognise
only legitimate Singpass QR codes and displays an error message if an invalid
QR code is scanned.</p>
<p>If you see such an error message, your guard should go up, and don‚Äôt attempt
to scan the QR code using another QR code reader. The fraudsters may very
well be relying on you to do so after being rejected by the Singpass app.</p>
<h3>3. Check the Singpass URL domain carefully</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Check the Singpass URL domain carefully" src="/images/technews/Five_ways_to_keep_your_Singpass_safe__2_.png">
</div>
<p>Think that you must be on the Singpass login page because it looks real
and bears the Singpass logo? Think again! Scammers are constantly updating
their methodologies, and phishing websites can look very similar to real
websites.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why you should always check that the URL domain on the Singpass
website is&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-ways-to-keep-your-singpass-safe#1-dont-share-your-singpass-details-with-others" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">singpass.gov.sg</a></em>&nbsp;before
you proceed. This will help to protect you from phishing websites that
trick you into disclosing your login details.</p>
<h3>4. Don‚Äôt ignore the alert about an unusual login</h3>
<p>Singpass will send you an alert when a login is performed on a device
or Internet browser that you don‚Äôt usually use. This is part of the real-time
fraud analytics deployed to identify suspicious behaviour.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt ignore the notification! If you did not perform the login, report
the incident immediately to the Singpass Helpdesk at 6335 3533 (operates
from 8am to 10pm on Mondays to Fridays, and from 8am to 6pm on Saturdays,
Sundays and public holidays) or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-ways-to-keep-your-singpass-safe#1-dont-share-your-singpass-details-with-others" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">support@singpass.gov.sg</a>&nbsp;(responds
in 3 working days) to secure your account.</p>
<p>Also, remember to update your contact details registered with Singpass
so that you can receive these transactional and security alerts promptly.</p>
<h3>5. Only one active Singpass app at a time</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Only one active Singpass app at a time" src="/images/technews/Five_ways_to_keep_your_Singpass_safe__3_.jpg">
</div>
<p>The Singpass app can only be installed on one mobile device at a time,
ensuring there is only one copy of your credentials.</p>
<p>This will come in handy should you misplace your mobile device or suspect
that your account has been compromised.</p>
<p>Simply install and activate the app on another device, and the app on
the lost device will be automatically deactivated. Alternatively, you can
deactivate the Singpass app via the Singpass portal.</p>
<h3>User vigilance is crucial in the fight against scams</h3>
<p>If in doubt, pause before doing anything. Take a moment to verify the
authenticity of the website or follow up on a security alert, and you can
save yourself a lot of time and grief.</p>
<p>If you see others who may be engaging in unsafe digital practices, remind
them that we can all do our part to protect our digital identity and data.
The more people we can help spread the word to, the more we can keep safe
from scammers.</p>
