<h3>It is easy today to imagine that everything can be placed “on the cloud” and have them run properly without a glitch.</h3>

<p>Especially with the pandemic, cloud services have made a real difference
in ensuring that important services can keep going and lives can carry
on. But for government agencies and businesses alike, one problem is common
when moving to many of today’s popular cloud services, such as those from
Google, Microsoft or Amazon - making sure that the services run well with
changing technology trends.</p>
<p>Placing all your eggs in one basket comes with risk. The same applies
to technology vendors, so any organisation needs to find a way to ensure
that it does not depend only on one cloud vendor for a critical part of
its infrastructure.</p>
<p>The problem is that it is not easy to juggle all the different technologies
from different vendors. Even though the idea of having one’s apps and data
running on multiple cloud vendors is gaining traction today, this is not
a simple undertaking.</p>
<h3>Harmonising data and apps</h3>
<p>It is important for government agencies to ensure that data is stored
accurately and securely. You certainly don’t want two different versions
of a citizen’s data on different clouds or exposed to unnecessary cybersecurity
risks, for example.</p>
<p>This is the reason why GovTech has been trying to ensure that similar
systems deployed for a service should run on a single cloud provider. Interoperability
is an important factor.</p>
<p>Despite the hype of multi-cloud setups, having data “harmonised” across
various clouds is a complex task and involves a fair degree of risk. The
challenge is to make sure that there is flexibility in choosing different
solutions while ensuring that the data and operations are not affected.</p>
<h3>Baby steps, first</h3>
<p>To be fair, many organisations are still taking a much less ambitious
step - simply getting on the cloud in the first place. Even moving from
using computers sitting in your own data centre or office to one that is
run by a large-scale operator isn’t as easy as many think.</p>
<p>This is why GovTech has set up a playbook of sorts for government agencies
to quickly get onto the cloud, while avoiding the common pitfalls faced
by others before. In the playbook are examples of what other agencies have
carried out in the past and the strategies they implemented, which can
be replicated for a quick and successful move to the cloud.</p>
<p>There are also templates, almost like “Happy Meals” or set lunches, in
which commonly required components are placed together, so there is less
time spent looking for where to start on the cloud.</p>
<h3>Need for expertise</h3>
<p>The expertise needed to run services on the cloud may be new for many
businesses. Indeed, the online environment can be unfamiliar to many IT
staff, at least compared to the old days of running a server themselves.</p>
<p>Yet, there are ways to better distil the lessons learnt from others that
have gone onto the cloud earlier that can be quickly disseminated. In Singapore,
a roving GovTech cloud engineering team also goes to government agencies
to assist them in onboarding cloud services. This “Swat team” of sorts
provides the technical expertise that may be needed to get things up and
running quickly.</p>
<p>Of course, the best way forward is to eventually build up cloud capabilities
in more government agencies, so that e-services delivered to citizens will
be improved over time. This way, the government can tap on the reach and
scale of the cloud while also be competent enough to tackle issues that
arise. Ultimately, this is the best way to serve citizens as we transform
how we deliver services through digital technologies.</p>
