<h3>Interested in building your own website or digital application but don’t know where to start? Here are some practical steps and useful resources to help you along.</h3>
<p>Let’s face it—in this digital age, some of the most useful languages you
can learn aren’t meant for human-to-human communication. Rather, a ‘mother
tongue’ that allows one to speak to computers, fluency in a programming
language (or two) is what separates creators of digital products from the
average digital consumer.</p>
<p>From building websites to mobile applications, learning how to code unlocks
a world of possibilities, not to mention career opportunities. According
to jobs site Glassdoor, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/highest-paying-entry-level-jobs-19/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">top two highest-paying entry-level</a>&nbsp;jobs
are ‘Data Scientist’ and ‘Software Engineer’, with median annual base salaries
in the range of US$90,000-95,000. Both are positions in which a coding
and computer science background would be advantageous.</p>
<p>So whether you’re thinking about pursuing a career in tech or simply want
to learn to code as a hobby, here are some things to think about before
you get started, alongside useful resources you can reference to learn
the skillset more.</p>
<h4>1. Code with purpose</h4>
<p>In other words, ask yourself: why do you want to code? What problem would
you like to solve that requires coding? Setting these objectives right
from the start can help you decide which programming language to pick up.</p>
<p>If your ambition is to create a whole new operating system, perhaps you
ought to learn C++. For developing a website, HTML would be an essential
starting point. Need help deciding? Check out this&nbsp;<a href="https://lifehacker.com/learn-which-programming-language-to-choose-with-this-in-1669612111" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">infographic</a>&nbsp;on
the different types of programming languages and their applications.</p>
<h4>2. Get the right tools</h4>
<p>Once you know which programming language you need, the next question might
be: Where do I type in the code? To do this, you’ll need to download a
code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) software. The difference
between the two is that IDEs provide much greater functionality to compile
and debug code in addition to just writing it.</p>
<p>Code editors include&nbsp;<a href="https://atom.io/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Atom</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="http://brackets.io/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Brackets</a>, many of which are free and open-source—excellent if you
just want to try your hand at programming. IDEs, on the other hand, usually
come with a price tag attached. Once again, knowing ‘what’ you want to
develop will help you select the right tool for the job. Click here for
a list of some popular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/best-ide" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IDEs</a>&nbsp;and
what they’re suitable for.</p>
<h4>3. Structure your learning</h4>
<p>While it’s possible to learn to code just by watching YouTube videos,
a proper course that takes you through fundamental concepts such as how
computers function, how networks work and so on can be incredibly helpful.
For example, thorough and well-curated courses for computer science and
programming can be found online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a>,&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Udemy</a>.</p>
<p>Each learning portal typically includes video lectures and follow-up tutorials
to help beginners put into practice what they learn. Many of these course
providers grant certificates of completion for their programmes but do
note that these certificates cannot be used for formal accreditation.</p>
<h4>4. Find inspiration</h4>
<p>Learning to code is a long and cumulative process, so some persistence
is definitely required. When you feel yourself losing interest or passion,
why not check out live-coding websites like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.education-ecosystem.com/projects" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this</a>&nbsp;to
remind yourself of what you’ll be able to do once you’ve achieved a certain
level of mastery? In the process, you’ll also get an idea of the challenges
that programmers run into when trying to create an application from scratch—perfect
for troubleshooting your own development project once the time comes.</p>
<p>Also, rather than code in isolation, you can tap into a whole community
of enthusiastic fellow developers on the internet for motivation and advice.&nbsp;
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>&nbsp;is one such platform for peer-to-peer learning,
with a vast repository of questions and answers on common and not-so-common
issues faced by software engineers.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;is another
collaborative development space that is even referenced by experienced
coders.</p>
<h4>5. Pay attention to code documentation</h4>
<p>A piece of code can be very opaque on its own. While the code’s creator
knows very well what each element does, it is just as crucial to ensure
that someone else can integrate or adapt the code into an application.
This is where code documentation is important.</p>
<p>Basically, code documentation is analogous to the instruction manual for
assembling an IKEA chair—it is often descriptive, human-readable and ideally
jargon-free so that it can be easily understood.</p>
<p>By poring through code documentation, newcomers to coding can learn specific
frameworks and features of code that actually work. And when you start
writing code at a higher level of competency, be sure to pay it forward
by documenting it well too!</p>
