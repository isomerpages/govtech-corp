  spam via Monty Python. Discover the stories behind everyday tech terms. 🖥️🐭

<p>You know how thoroughly tech has become part of our lives when some industrial
terms are now used in everyday conversation.</p>
<p>You know, like when you complain that you can’t order lunch because the
food delivery app is really “buggy”, or that your ex has been “spamming”
you with texts.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wondered how these terms came about (why is a glitch a
bug?), then you’ve come to the right place! Let’s explore the origins of
some common tech terms!</p>
<h3>Bugs have been bugging since 19th century</h3>
<p>A bug is an error or flaw in a computer system’s software or hardware
nowadays. However, engineers and other technical professionals have used
the term for a long time.</p>
<p>One of the earliest records of the word “bug” being used to describe a
tech problem comes from an 1870s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/who-coined-term-bug-thomas-edison" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">letter</a>&nbsp;by
Thomas Edison, in which he wrote that he “did find a ‘bug’ in my apparatus”.
That’s right, the bug is more than 150 years old.</p>
<p>Other famous users of the term include writer Isaac Asimov, who used it
in one of his short stories in 1944.</p>
<p>But the best use of “bug” in our book comes from 1947 when the operators
of a giant calculator (a wall-to-wall behemoth, not the pocket one you
carry around) found a moth that was causing a malfunction. They&nbsp;
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:First_Computer_Bug,_1945.jpg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">taped it</a>&nbsp;to the incident report – a literal bug causing a bug!</p>
<h3>A mouse that’s welcome in every home</h3>
<p>Although computer mice are not as common a sight as they once were – desktops
are giving way to laptops with trackpads, tablets, and mobile devices –
the mouse still deserves mention because it fundamentally changed the way
we interact with computers.</p>
<p>Users no longer had to tap-tap-tap on keyboards to wade through a graphical
interface. Instead, the mere motion of the hand was enough to navigate
your way around the screen, as can be seen in this )<a href="https://youtu.be/B6rKUf9DWRI?t=43" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1968 demonstration</a>,
self-dubbed the “mother of all demos”.</p>
<p>As for the name? Unfortunately, there’s no cool backstory to that. The
inventor and presenter Doug Engelbart&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/origins-computer-mouse/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">said plainly</a>&nbsp;during
the demo: “I don’t know why we call it a mouse.”</p>
<p>But if you look at the video linked above, the first version of the mouse
had the connecting wire (yes, the mouse was once wired, the wireless mouse
is a much more recent development, dear Gen Z readers) coming out at the
back instead of the front of the mouse, making it resemble a real-life
rodent even more. And that resemblance is what we’ll have to settle for
as a backstory.</p>
<h3>Spam – from yummy canned meat to hated junk mail</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, spam referred to only canned processed meat – more commonly
known as luncheon meat here. How did it come to mean junk email and text
messages offering everything from dubious stock tips to scam baits dangling
instant inheritances?</p>
<p>Most sources online point to a 1970 episode of the Monty Python&nbsp;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming#/media/File:Monty_Python_Live_02-07-14_13_04_42_(14598710791).jpg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sketch</a>&nbsp;show in which a restaurant has spam in almost every item
on the menu, exasperating one customer but delighting others as they sing
“Spam, spam, spam, spam…” You get the idea.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, early versions of online chat rooms occasionally saw spammy
behaviour. One example was an offending user using an automated script
to repeatedly type the word “spam”, flooding the channel and killing legitimate
discussion.</p>
<p>But according to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.templetons.com/brad/spamterm.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">internet researcher</a>,
it was in 1994 when a couple of lawyers posted their services on as many
online message boards as they could that “spam” caught on with the wider
public.</p>
<h3>Cookies that aren’t munchy</h3>
<p>This is another example of a snack-turned tech term that’s not so positive
nowadays. Cookies store the data of users so that websites can serve up
personalised content at a faster speed, though with increasing concerns
about privacy in recent years, they’ve taken on a somewhat negative rep.</p>
<p>As for the name, it comes from the term “magic cookie”, a pack of data
sent back and forth by Unix programmes. You can read more about how the
cookie came about from none other than the inventor himself in this&nbsp;
<a href="https://montulli.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-reasoning-behind-web-cookies.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">blog post.</a>
</p>
<p>And by the way, he definitely did not mean for it to be a&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/2000350/the-inventor-of-the-digital-cookie-has-some-regrets/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">means for advertisers</a>&nbsp;to
track you.</p>
<h3>Worms worming their way in</h3>
<p>A computer worm is a malware that replicates itself across a network,
infecting connected computers. The 1975 novel&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shockwave_Rider" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Shockwave Rider</a>&nbsp;is
credited for coining the term “worm” to describe a self-propagating programme.</p>
<p>Of course, it entered public consciousness only after a major attack by
the Morris Worm that affected the networks of various universities and
government agencies. It was dubbed the first major internet attack by the&nbsp;

</p>
<h3>New terms coming up all the time</h3>
<p>Tech is ever-evolving, so new lingo will definitely emerge as well. Case
in point, viruses usually refer to malicious computer programmes. But social
media has made going viral a form of praise for engaging user content.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing ever more inventive and catchy terms that are
earworms we don’t mind spamming our friends with!</p>
