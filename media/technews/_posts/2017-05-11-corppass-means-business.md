If you run a business, you might at the moment be using multiple digital identities—such as SingPass and EASY—to access various services on government websites.

Here’s a heads-up: Time now to make the switch to CorpPass, Singapore’s first single corporate digital identity.

Managed by GovTech, CorpPass lets businesses, non-profit organisations and other entities transact with the government online in a more secured and convenient manner.

Since the initiative was rolled out in September 2016, there are now more than 100 government digital services that use CorpPass as a login mechanism.

By December 2017, CorpPass will be the required login method for these services, replacing existing modes.

To reach out to SMEs and inform them about the benefits of CorpPass, GovTech manned an information-packed booth at the SME Centre Conference on 5 April 2017.

Supported by SPRING Singapore, the conference is an annual event for small and medium enterprises to network and pick the brains of industry leaders and domain experts.

### **One identity to access them all**
Visitors to the CorpPass booth chatted with GovTech representatives to find out more about the initiative, and could even sign up for it on the spot.

Ms Bhali Gill, a corporate psychologist and trainer at Corporate Wellbeing, a coaching company offering mental and emotional wellbeing programmes, stopped by the booth to find out more.

“The initiative makes sense, and it will be helpful if I expand the company,” she told TechNews. “I’m also interested to check out the other government digital services. It’s good to be able to access them all with one login, because otherwise it can get quite confusing.”

In addition to better internal control and convenience for businesses, CorpPass also makes transactions more secure.

Because government services currently use SingPass — meant for personal transactions — as a login method, employees who go on leave sometimes share their personal SingPass usernames and passwords with their colleagues, so that transactions such as permit applications and corporate tax filing can carry on in their absence.

The use of SingPass also presents a problem when employees leave the company, taking their personal identifier with them.

Having CorpPass as a separate login method for corporate matters will thus help to improve security and privacy for both individuals and businesses.

In addition, CorpPass also allows business owners to set up and manage user accounts for employees. These accounts can be disabled at any time if they are compromised.

Mr Kwek Chang, director of Cipher Tech, a secure electronics company, found out about CorpPass when registering for a Unique Entity Number (UEN) for his business, and stopped by the booth to learn more.

“Previously, when someone quit or left the company, you had a problem,” he said. “CorpPass is much better because you can manage access. Now the business owner can set up accounts and assign users, so it doesn’t matter if people leave.”

### **Joining CorpPass**
Many conference attendees found the CorpPass booth useful and informative.

“It’s good to educate people and get them to register for CorpPass before the end of the year, when we can no longer use SingPass for business transactions,” added Mr Kwek.

CorpPass will be present at more roadshows and events to come — do keep a lookout for them if you want to find out more about CorpPass!
