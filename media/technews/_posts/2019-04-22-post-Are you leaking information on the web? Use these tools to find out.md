<h3>Information that is publicly available on the internet can be used for good or malicious intent. Here‚Äôs how you can scan the web with open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools to protect yourself or your organisation.</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs a recurrent trope in spy movies‚Äîa skilled secret agent infiltrates
an organisation and gathers compromising data on its people and processes;
information that can be used as leverage. Far from being limited to works
of fiction, such intelligence gathering is more common in everyday life
than you think, especially in this digital age.</p>
<p>For example, when companies seek to fill a position, their human resource
division runs background checks on potential candidates, tapping information
on job portals and even social media pages to make hiring decisions. Intelligence
amassed from public and unclassified sources and analysed for a specific
purpose‚Äîbe it national security or corporate profiling‚Äîis known as open-source
intelligence (OSINT). Depending on how the information is used, it can
help or harm individuals and organisations.</p>
<p>Here are three things you need to know about OSINT, with tips on how you
can identify and plug information ‚Äòleakages‚Äô about yourself and your organisation.</p>
<h3>What are some key OSINT sources?</h3>
<p>Traditional media remains one of the most accessible sources of public
information. These include magazines and newspapers as well as radio and
television broadcasts. Some governments and corporations may also put out
unclassified datasets and reports for public viewing.</p>
<p>Importantly, following the dawn of the Internet, new media such as blog
posts, digital newsletters and social media have emerged and quickly developed
into an OSINT treasure trove. Not only is new media accessible from anywhere.
It is also easily shared, which means that it enters the collective consciousness
of the general populace more rapidly.</p>
<h3>Why should you use OSINT?</h3>
<p>OSINT can be used by companies to inform the hiring process. Law enforcement
agencies could also use OSINT to identify and track security threats. In
these contexts, OSINT is directed outward.</p>
<p>However, organisations can also carry out OSINT on themselves to learn
more about their online privacy and security landscape. For example, OSINT
could help organisations uncover leaked credentials of high-value targets
such as C-suite personnel. Employees may also inadvertently reveal their
organisation‚Äôs IT assets on their LinkedIn profiles, perhaps even providing
outsiders with details on the operating systems and servers used as IT
infrastructure at their organisation. Similarly, developers may fail to
keep application source code confidential.</p>
<p>Having an OSINT protocol in place could help plug these loopholes before
they are exploited by hostile groups.</p>
<h3>How do I perform OSINT?</h3>
<p>Search engines and social media sites are perhaps the most straightforward
means of carrying out OSINT. Simply by keying in the name of an individual
or organisation, one can learn what the public knows about the said party.</p>
<p>To go deeper, organisations can use advanced search engines like:</p>
<h3>Google Hacking Database</h3>
<p>The Google Hacking Database (GHD) is a repository of custom Google search
terms for files containing sensitive information such as usernames, vulnerable
servers, and even passwords, also known as ‚ÄòGoogle Dorks‚Äô. Attackers can
use this database to identify search strings that may uncover vulnerabilities
and sensitive information on affected websites.</p>
<p>For example, the following search string would produce a list of directories
within with directory listing enabled, and these files are publicly accessible:</p>
<p><strong>site: intitle:‚Äùindex of‚Äù</strong>
</p>
<p>Hence, organisations may use GHD to check whether any of their sensitive
information is inadvertently exposed via these custom search strings.</p>
<h3>Wayback Machine</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> is
a digital archive of the World Wide Web that stores snapshots of websites
at various points in time over the course of history. Attackers may use
it to gather compromising intelligence about an organisation through earlier
versions of its websites.</p>
<p>Defensively, organisations may use Wayback Machine to ensure that no sensitive
data exists in legacy editions of its webpages.</p>
<h3>Sploitus</h3>
<p><a href="https://sploitus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sploitus</a>is
a search engine for publicly-available exploits for vulnerable software.
Attackers may use these exploits to launch attacks against organisational
assets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organisations may use Sploitus to find out if exploits
for the specific software versions they are using are publicly available.
Organisations can then remediate these exploits to pre-empt a breach.</p>
<p>For example, if an organisation server is using Drupal 8.6.10 (a Content
Management System, or CMS), a search in Sploitus could reveal if a public
exploit exists to compromise the CMS.</p>
<h3>HaveIBeenPwned</h3>

</div>
<p><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HaveIBeenPwned</a> is
a search engine for compromised email addresses. Anyone can use it to check
if their email addresses have been hijacked for malicious purposes and
identify which breaches the email addresses were involved in. If an employee
learns that his or her email address has been compromised, they can be
advised to change their passwords or to enable 2-factor authentication.</p>
<p>Hopefully, with the sharing of some of these basic OSINT tools, you can
now leverage this knowledge to discover unexpected information you or your
organisation might have leaked on the internet. Take action now to prevent
vulnerabilities from being exploited.</p>
