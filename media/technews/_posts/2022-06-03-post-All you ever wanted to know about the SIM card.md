<p>Hands up if you‚Äôve ever heard of the SIM card. Yes, we see that all of
you are reaching for the sky.</p>

<p>Now, hands up if you know what SIM stands for. Chances are, there aren‚Äôt
many hands left up. Even though SIM cards have been by our side since the
time we owned our first mobile phones, there is precious little we know
about them (including the tidbit that SIM stands for Subscriber Identity
Module).</p>
<p>And this is a pity, because this fundamental piece of technology has enabled
us to store our contacts, make calls, and send text messages over the decades.
So if you want to stop taking it for granted and learn about the history
of the SIM card, you‚Äôve come to the right place!</p>
<h3>Mobile phones pre-SIM</h3>
<p>Mobile phones existed before SIM, but not in a way that we‚Äôre familiar
with today. In 1973, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/03/mobile-phone-40th-anniversary" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">first handheld mobile phone call</a> was
made with a phone that was dubbed a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù because of its heft.</p>
<p>A decade later, the <a href="https://www.tigermobiles.com/evolution/#zeroPhone" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">first commercial mobile phone</a> was
launched by Motorola, costing US$4,000 for the handset alone!</p>
<h3>Evolution of SIM card ‚Äì smaller yet mightier</h3>
<p>As its name suggests, a Subscriber Identity Module is used to identify
and authenticate you, the subscriber. It was developed in 1991 by German
Smart Card Maker Giesecke+Devrient for Finnish Network provider, Radiolinja,
and was based on the specifications previously set by the European Telecommunications
Standards Institute (ETSI). It stored subscriber information ‚Äì including
the associated phone number ‚Äì in a circuit embedded in a plastic card.
Just as importantly, it is what enables your device to connect to a mobile
network, through which you can make calls, send text messages, and go online.</p>
<p>This first iteration of the SIM card was as large as a credit card, which
wasn‚Äôt too out of the world for its time as mobile phones were way bigger
back then. The SIM card was where you stored the names and contact numbers
of your family and friends, as well as SMS messages (remember those?).</p>
<p>The earliest versions of SIM cards were able to store a whopping five
SMS messages and 20 contacts. Remember, this was the early 90s, where you
had to carry a (paper) notebook and write down phone numbers or memorise
them, so 20 contacts was life-changing.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.aeris.com/news/post/the-history-of-the-sim-card-where-its-going-and-where-its-been/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1996</a>,
the SIM card shrank in size dramatically, becoming known as the mini-SIM.
About the size of the top portion of your thumb, it usually fitted in a
nook behind the battery of mobile phones (this was the era when Nokia was
the top mobile dog and removable batteries were a thing).</p>
<p>The mini-SIM continued to be the standard for the next decade and a half
until 2010, when the micro-SIM ‚Äì about the size of your thumb‚Äôs nail ‚Äì
took its place. In just two short years, the micro-SIM itself was replaced
by the nano-SIM, which was just the size of your pinkie‚Äôs nail. By that
time, SIM cards could store over 250 contacts.</p>
<h3>Rise of the eSIM</h3>
<p>In today‚Äôs world, SIM cards are no longer just for mobile phones. The
Internet of Things means that a myriad of electronics, from everyday appliances
like refrigerators to gizmos like drones, need connectivity. This is where
<a href="https://sea.pcmag.com/mobile-phones/42461/what-is-an-esim-card" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">eSIMs</a>, or embedded SIMs, come in.</p>
<p>They are basically the circuitry of a SIM card soldered into the device
itself, so an extra slot is not needed. This is especially valuable for
smaller gadgets like smartwatches where space is of the essence.</p>
<p>The eSIMs can also be remotely reprogrammed to change their mobile service
plans or providers, enabling a bunch of devices to be managed in one go.
If you have a large space outfitted with CCTV cameras that have eSIMs,
you won‚Äôt have to go to each one of them one by one in order to swap out
SIM cards to change mobile providers.</p>
<p>The same goes for mobile phones with eSIMs. You can use two different
lines on the same phone without having to physically pop out one SIM card
and pop in another. For instance, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT209044" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">certain models of the iPhone</a> support
two active eSIMs at the same time or one nano-SIM with one eSIM.</p>
<p>Of course, the downside is that if your mobile device breaks down, you
can‚Äôt just take out your SIM card and slide it into a replacement device.</p>
<h3>What‚Äôs next, the pico-SIM?</h3>
<p>The eSIM has not caught on in a widespread way in Singapore yet, but tech
tastes are always evolving so don‚Äôt count it out yet.</p>
<p>Or who knows, maybe the physical SIM card will undergo yet another downsizing
and we‚Äôll all be using pico-SIMs soon.</p>
<p>Our reliance on mobile networks will only continue to increase as more
devices need connectivity, so stay tuned for the next iteration of the
SIM!</p>
