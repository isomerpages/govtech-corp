<p>Mention museums and you’ll usually think of history, artifacts, and antiques.</p>
<p>But head down to Changi Chapel and Museum, and you’ll get a dose of cutting-edge
technology. There, one of the museum guides moves around on wheels and
welcomes you with audio and videos on a flat screen.</p>
<p>That’s right, Temi is a commercial robot that’s been programmed and trained
as a tour guide for the museum featuring life as prisoners of war during
World War II.</p>

<h3>What’s Temi and what can it do?</h3>
<p>Though petite, with height reaching the waist level of an average adult,
Temi is fully equipped with the necessary intellect and wisdom to navigate
and lead museum visitors through various exhibits entirely on its own.</p>
<p>It enhances the museum experience for visitors by narrating stories and
playing video content that adds context to the physical exhibitions on
display. All visitors have to do is register at the entrance and use the
touchscreen on Temi to interact with the robot. As such, visitors can engage
Temi at their convenience instead of waiting for scheduled tours by human
guides.</p>
<h3>How does Temi do what it does?</h3>
<p>The project started when the National Heritage Board approached GovTech
for solutions to complement its human tour guides. After considering several
options, the team decided to build upon an existing, commercially available
robot for its mechanical tour guide.</p>
<p>GovTech engineers developed a customised app to display the videos for
visitor viewing. They also handled the mapping of the path that Temi would
move in the museum. This involved detailing every waypoint in the tour
route so that the robot could move autonomously.</p>
<p>The lidar sensor on Temi enables it to detect obstacles in the path so
it doesn’t knock into other visitors or objects that are in its way. Contractors
were also engaged to paste stickers on certain translucent glass doors
so that Temi would be able to recognise the door as an object it should
avoid.</p>
<p>Temi is also able to navigate back to the charging station when it is
low on battery, so no human effort is needed to carry it back when the
battery runs out.</p>
<h3>Any special tricks up Temi’s sleeves?</h3>
<p>Doors are not an issue for Temi! The robot can trigger signals to open
automated sliding doors and keep them open while it passes through.</p>
<p>It can also automatically lower the volume of other exhibit videos that
are playing near the robot. This is so that visitors can focus on the content
that Temi is presenting. When Temi moves to another area, the volume of
the exhibit videos will revert to the original level.</p>
<p>To enable these functions, the GovTech team had to retrofit Temi with
some hardware known as DECADA Edge. The device acts as a gateway to control
the opening of the glass doors and lower the volume of the sound system.
This is done by relaying and transmitting messages from the robot, enabling
it to communicate with other sensors.</p>
<h3>What’s next for Temi?</h3>
<p>Temi is deployed at Changi Chapel and Museum as a proof of concept. If
the guide proves to be a hit with visitors, more of such robot guides will
be deployed to other museums so that more## visitors can benefit from them.</p>
<p>There is also potential to further develop Temi’s ability to interact
with other tech equipment. For example, it is possible to programme Temi
to coordinate a fully synchronised visual and audio show by connecting
it to different lighting, sound, and IoT systems. This will make for an
immersive tour experience that engages visitors’ different senses.</p>
