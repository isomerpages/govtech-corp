<p>Work-life balance: it‚Äôs something we all strive for. For the parents out
there, it‚Äôs a goal that is all the more challenging as life consists of
young ones who depend on them for care and love.</p>
<p>With Mother‚Äôs Day around the corner, we spoke to three GovTechies who
are moms ‚Äì Pradeep Kaur, Lydia Lee, and Ruth Cheng ‚Äì to hear what they
have to say about raising kids while having a fulfilling career.</p>

</p>
<h3>First off, tell us more about what you do at GovTech?</h3>
<p><strong>Pradeep:</strong>&nbsp;I am a Digital Service Manager, and that
entails leading a team of project managers and business analysts to deliver
ICT solutions for the agency‚Äôs business requirements. I was in charge of
the Corporate &amp; Common Applications and Cloud Adoption programme at
the Ministry of Manpower, and my team managed systems like messaging platforms,
data exchange gateway, and corporate systems, and also tracking and supporting
other MOM teams in cloud migration.</p>
<p><strong>Lydia:</strong>&nbsp;I market and communicate the benefits of
GovTech‚Äôs products through media, social media, and other platforms that
are most suitable for our target audiences. I‚Äôm currently working on SafeEntry‚Äôs
range of products, such as SafeEntry QR and the TraceTogether Token, as
well as the National Digital Identity suite of services, such as the Singpass
app and MyInfo.</p>
<p>I am quite excited when we get to work with our product teams to design
and launch a product and receive feedback from the users. It‚Äôs really an
end-to-end process.</p>
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong>&nbsp;As an Engagement Manager, I engage with government
agencies to help their stakeholders discover how Video Analytics can enhance
their agencies‚Äô operational capabilities and efficiencies. It‚Äôs extremely
meaningful to use video analytics to level up their operational capabilities.
I also find it very inspiring to work with very brilliant-minded individuals
in the team and feel proud that the cutting-edge technology they build
can benefit agencies and citizens!</p>
<p>One of my most recent projects is also in collaboration with the Singapore
Food Agency, where we used AI technology and image analytics to automate
the laborious counting of rotifers (fish food) so that fish farms become
more productive.</p>
<h3>Speaking of the Covid-19 situation, how has GovTech supported you during this time of change and uncertainty?</h3>
<p><strong>Lydia:</strong>&nbsp;My reporting officers and teammates are very
supportive of our family-first priority. That said, we have a lot of trust
and confidence in one another to deliver our work on time and cover for
each other when any of us have a family emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong>&nbsp;I joined GovTech amid the circuit breaker
in 2020 and I was really blessed to have great teammates and bosses who
were juggling similar work and family demands as well and hence incredibly
understanding of the challenges that I face. We do share parenting tips
at times and covering of workload in situations where we have to apply
for leave of absence due to family matters.</p>
<p><strong>Pradeep:</strong>&nbsp;Times were challenging for MOM with the
Covid-19 situation. However we worked together and managed to tide through
the difficult period by supporting each other. We made it a point to be
respectful of each others‚Äô family time and setup meetings or discussions
accordingly.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I also went on No Pay Leave for a year to help my younger
daughter with her PSLE next year. My bosses were supportive of this request.</p>
<h3>So, how would you describe yourselves as mothers?</h3>
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm an OBS (Outward
Bound Singapore) instructor with my kids. I‚Äôm very hands-on in giving guidance
to their daily routines (habits, manners etc). I also care a lot about
helping them to discover their own strengths and leadership potential.
I tend to be more adventurous, so I usually plan outdoor activities on
weekends to destinations less trodden in the hope of building their own
resilience and teamwork between siblings.</p>
<p><strong>Pradeep:</strong>&nbsp;I try to spend as much time with my daughters
as I can. I love to hear them chat about their day. My husband and I jointly
coach them, be it their studies, assignments, playtime or any other advice
they need from us.</p>
<p>Recently, we also started taking evening walks as a family, and it turned
out to be a great stress buster for me. Watching the sunrise at Pasir Ris
Beach during the weekends is now one of our favourite activities.</p>
<p><strong>Lydia:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like I‚Äôm the commanding officer to
my kids sometimes and other times, I‚Äôm also their friend. We don‚Äôt have
a domestic helper, so I encourage my kids to do simple chores (e.g. folding
their clothes, keeping their toys) and on weekdays, I manage my kids‚Äô homework
and prepare them for school the next day.</p>
<p>On weekends, my husband and I encourage our kids to play hard. With two
boys, we try to exhaust their energy by bringing them out to explore different
parks, playgrounds, and beaches to try different sports (e.g. badminton,
cycling, scooting). I enjoy trying out different activities, so it helps
that I have an added excuse (my kids) to spur me on.</p>
<h3>What are your top tips for moms to achieve a balance between work and kids?</h3>
<p><strong>Lydia:</strong>&nbsp;There is no such thing as a perfect mom.
Parenting has this steep learning curve that you will never get ahead of
simply because every child is different. It‚Äôs important to manage your
expectations. Surround yourself with people/ parents who are like-minded
and don‚Äôt make you feel bad. It‚Äôs important to have people who encourage
you and lend a helping hand when you can‚Äôt do it yourself. That sanity
check helps to keep me going.</p>
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong>&nbsp;Yup, it‚Äôs important to manage your own expectations
of your kids ‚Äì kids will be kids so do expect a lot of hiccups and detours
along the way and just go with their flow at times. Also, if you feel burned
out from motherly duties, it‚Äôs not wrong at all to switch to the reverse
gear and take a break (even when you‚Äôre inclined to push on further). Your
kids and work can afford to wait while you catch a breath and get your
sanity back on track.</p>
<h3>Yes, kids have a way of derailing the best-laid plans, in a good way! Any funny incidents like the BBC Dad that you can share?</h3>
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong>&nbsp;My younger son was having a high fever one
night so I stayed up for the night to take care of him. The next morning,
I felt extremely tired from staying up all night but I had to power through
and get myself ready for a conference call in the morning. In the midst
of the call, my younger son opened the door, walked into the room and brightly
announced (while I was unmuted), ‚ÄúMummy thank you so much for taking care
of me last night. I feel better already. Love you.‚Äù I felt a little embarrassed
that my colleagues heard his little love declaration, but I was honestly
very touched by his words.</p>
<p><strong>Lydia:</strong>&nbsp;I was on a con call with a few directors
and I accidentally dropped off the call. When I signed in, I was unmuted
and one of the directors asked ‚Äúdoes anyone else have any comments?‚Äù. No
one said anything for a while. Then my 2 year old proudly declared, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
here!‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Pradeep:</strong>&nbsp;My daughters haven‚Äôt really walked in on
any of my calls, but during work from home, they‚Äôve watched me taking call
after call. One day they asked me, ‚ÄòDo you ever work or do you just talk
to your office friends all the time?‚Äô</p>
<h3>Finally, can you sum up the joys that come with motherhood?</h3>
<p><strong>Pradeep:</strong>&nbsp;The time I get to spend with my daughters,
I find it very precious. I enjoy seeing them doing everyday stuff, learning
and growing with it. When I hear from teachers about my daughters being
very kind and helpful, I feel content and proud. Their love is unconditional,
and I find it hard to describe the joy of motherhood in words.</p>
<p><strong>Lydia:</strong>&nbsp;I am very blessed to have two healthy boys.
Watching them grow up, learn new things about the world, explore and just
be kids brings me so much joy and happiness.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm probably biased, but I feel that boys are also especially sweet and
affectionate to their mothers. I love it when they shower me with handmade
gifts (with no special occasion), hugs, kisses and lots of cuddles.</p>
<p><strong>Ruth:</strong>&nbsp;My joy is seeing my kids trying their best
to learn, hearing them say ‚ÄúI love you mummy‚Äù, being the first person they
run to when they‚Äôre down, also being their first person they run to when
they‚Äôre excited about something, knowing that I am my kids‚Äô universe, and
knowing that they are my universe.</p>
<p><em>Kudos to all mothers who wear many hats in their daily lives and for keeping a strong front before your families and your colleagues. This feat wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without their allies - fathers, grandparents, leaders, managers, co-workers, etc. - so a big shout-out to you too!</em>
