<h3>By developing a mobile canvas that automatically dispenses paint, engineers at GovTech hope to lend a helping hand to persons with special needs.</h3>

<p>With only her mouth, this 19-year-old painter toggles a joystick positioned
next to her face to move around in a wheelchair. Due to circumstances surrounding
her premature birth, Ms Elaine Eng was born with cerebral palsy—a lifelong,
physical disability that affects both movement and posture.</p>
<p>Despite her limitations, Elaine enjoys painting. She lays an array of
colours onto an empty canvas using a paintbrush held in her mouth. At the
moment, Elaine receives assistance from volunteers at the Cerebral Palsy
Alliance Singapore (CPAS), who help her move the canvas and dispense paint.</p>
<p>In August 2018, a team led by Dr Ong Lay Teen, a Senior System Engineer
at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), visited CPAS
to discuss how they could apply new technologies to help those with physical
disability. “We were introduced to Elaine and were told that she is a mouth
painter,” recalled Dr Ong. “It all began from there when we saw her passion
to paint.”</p>

<h3>A dream come true for mouth painters</h3>
<p>Moved by Elaine’s love for painting, the team decided to build the e-canvas,
a voice-controlled device that would provide greater independence for her
artistic endeavours.</p>
<p>The eCanvas consists of a motorised aluminium frame that clamps onto a
drawing canvas and moves the canvas to within the reach of the painter.
A microphone connects to the eCanvas receives voice commands of the painter,
either to move the canvas or dispense paint on a palette. A mini-computer
installed with a pre-trained nueral network engine processes the voice
commands. “At the beginning, the idea was to have a canvas that moved up
and down,” said Mr Quek Yang Boon, Director of Smart Nation Systems and
Solutions, Sensors and Internet of Things at GovTech.</p>
<p>But the project soon evolved into something bigger, with the paint dispenser
as an example of the team’s ingenuity. Improvised from simple, off-the-shelf
items, the paint dispenser consists of a number of soap dispensers that
had been repurposed to release paint onto a turntable, which acts as the
palette.</p>
<p>“Each person involved [in the e-canvas project] had a different skillset
that blended very well together,” said Mr Quek. The team specifically designed
or sourced for parts of the eCanvas, such as the paintbrush holder and
circuit board. “Every single bolt and nut that’s on there was screwed on
by us. I believe that is what true engineering is about,” he added.</p>
<h3>Perfecting the eCanvas’ design</h3>
<p>Even originally planned features, such as the voice command system, had
to be revised several times before they could perform well enough. “We
imagined that the solution would be this or that,” Dr Ong shared, “but
when we tested the eCanvas on site, we realised that we had to change the
design for it to be more applicable to Elaine.”</p>
<p>Instead of a generic system that could recognise many words, the team
built a custom system—powered by a convolutional neural network—to recognise
only a few keywords for better performance. To further increase the system’s
accuracy, Elaine’s voice was added into the mix when training the device.</p>
<p>The voice control system interface was designed to provide a seamless
user experience for Elaine. She did not have to navigate through levels
of voice commands like in a phone menu, as the options were parallelised
onto a single layer. This meant that Elaine would only have to say a specific
command for a desired action to occur.</p>
<h3>Enabling one for many</h3>
<p>The eCanvas project demonstrates how technology can be used to improve
lives and showcases the engineering and development capabilities within
GovTech. From hardware to software, the Sensors and Internet of Things
(SIOT) team has the expertise to potentially make a difference in the assistive
technologies space, said Mr Quek. For instance, the ideas and solutions
put forth to cater to those with physical disabilities can be adapted to
serve other segments of the population as well, such as the elderly, which
will comprise a quarter of Singapore’s population by the year 2030.</p>
<p>This aligns with GovTech’s focus on inclusiveness, whereby no individual
is left behind as Singapore digitalises and strives to become a smart nation.
“As part of the government, we tend to always look at the big picture and
to take on a lot of big projects,” said Mr Quek. “What I think the eCanvas
shows is that we can also look at the value that technology can create
for smaller segments of society who may be overlooked.”</p>
