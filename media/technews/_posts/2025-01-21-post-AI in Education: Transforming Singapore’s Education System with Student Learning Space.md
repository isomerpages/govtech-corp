<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many schools were forced to shift
to home-based learning to stem the spread of the virus. This led to a greater
necessity to develop more sophisticated and well-rounded online learning
platforms to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>cater to students’ learning needs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meet teachers’ expectations for more efficient ways to plan lessons and
track students' development.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined with the need to stay up-to-date with the rapid advancements
in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Ministry of Education (MOE), in collaboration
with GovTech, launched the <a href="/products-and-services/for-citizens/education/student-learning-space/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Student Learning Space (SLS)</u></a> in
2018, with substantial and consistent upgrades—including <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/ai-in-sls/about-ai-in-sls/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>AI-enabled tools</u></a>—in
its features over the years.</p>
<p>Such efforts are in line with the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/educational-technology-journey/edtech-masterplan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>“Transforming Education through Technology” (EdTech) Masterplan 2030</u></a>,
launched in September 2023 by MOE. This plan envisions <em>"Technology-transformed learning, to prepare students for a technology-transformed world,"</em> reflecting
MOE’s commitment to adapting teaching methods to the digital age.</p>
<p>Through this master plan, MOE seeks to impart students with digital literacy,
support diverse learning needs, and equip students with the skills needed
to thrive in an increasingly complex, tech-driven world.</p>
<p>Let's explore the benefits of integrating AI into education, and discover
