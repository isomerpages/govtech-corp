<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many schools were forced to shift
to home-based learning to stem the spread of the virus. This led to a greater
necessity to develop more sophisticated and well-rounded online learning
platforms to cater to the students’ learning needs and fulfil the teachers’
desire for more robust options to plan their lesson content and track student
development online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combined with the need to stay up-to-date with the rapid technological
developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Ministry of Education
(MOE) launched the <a href="/products-and-services/for-citizens/education/student-learning-space/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Student Learning Space (SLS)</u></a> in
2018, with substantial and consistent upgrades—including <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/ai-in-sls/about-ai-in-sls/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>AI-enabled tools</u></a>—in
its features over the years.</p>
<p>Such efforts are in line with the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/educational-technology-journey/edtech-masterplan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>“Transforming Education through Technology” (EdTech) Masterplan 2030</u></a>,
launched in September 2023 by MOE. This plan envisions "Technology-transformed
learning, to prepare students for a technology-transformed world," reflecting
MOE’s commitment to adapting teaching methods to the digital age. Through
this master plan, MOE seeks to impart students with digital literacy, support
diverse learning needs, and equip students with the skills needed to thrive
in an increasingly complex, tech-driven world.</p>

<h3>What is the Student Learning Space?</h3>
<p>The <a href="/products-and-services/for-citizens/education/student-learning-space/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Student Learning Space (SLS)</u></a> is
a national online platform developed by MOE to enrich students' learning
through technology. Accessible to all school teachers and students in the
national school system, SLS offers high-quality, curriculum-aligned resources
across major subjects from primary to pre-university levels.</p>
<p>The platform continually evolves with input from users, integrating feedback
and updating in line with educational needs and policy. SLS’s open system
design supports over 250 integrated external tools and resources, ensuring
it meets the needs of an increasingly dynamic educational landscape.</p>

<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Personalised Learning for Students</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">AI customises learning paths based on each student's strengths, weaknesses,
and learning styles. It then provides adaptive and tailored instruction
that enhances individual understanding and mastery. This allows students
to learn at their own pace with AI as a guiding mentor or tool for them
to use.</div>

</div>
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Increased Engagement with Content</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Through interactive simulations, multimedia, and gamified content, AI-driven
platforms make learning more immersive. This has the potential to engage
students better and motivate them to actively participate and do their
work.</div>

<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">More Inclusivity and Accessibility</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">AI can bring about greater inclusivity by catering to diverse learning
needs and styles. It can do so by offering content in various formats (visual,
auditory, etc.), speech-to-text, and text-to-speech functions to support
all students, regardless of learning preferences or abilities.</div>

<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">More Time and Attention for Students</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">AI automates routine administrative tasks like attendance and grading,
and speeds up lesson planning. This enables teachers to focus more on direct
student interaction and mentorship, while identifying students who may
be struggling and offering them personalised attention.</div>

<h3>Adaptive Learning System (ALS)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/ai-in-sls/aied-features/adaptive-learning-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Adaptive Learning System (ALS)</u></a>,
integrated into the SLS platform, is an AI-enabled educational system developed
by MOE and GovTech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently available for Mathematics (Upper Primary) and Geography (Upper
Secondary), ALS uses <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/data-and-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>machine learning</u></a> to
deliver personalised learning pathways tailored to each student’s unique
needs. It guides students through a curriculum that adapts to their progress
and mastery levels.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Key Features and Benefits of ALS</h4>
<div class="isomer-card-grid">
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Personalised Learning Pathways</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">ALS adjusts to each student’s needs by offering multiple learning pathways
within each subject. Students can choose topics and ALS will recommend
tailored resources, practice questions, and feedback based on their understanding
and readiness.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Self-Directed Learning Tools</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">ALS offers students self-directed learning options. They can access ALS
independently to review topics before class, receive motivational prompts,
and prepare for assessments. For test preparation, students can select
the "Test Myself" mode where they can assess their level of understanding.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Feedback and Support</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">ALS generates feedback. If a student gives a wrong answer, ALS may offer
hints or explanations to help them understand their mistake before they
try again. The system's automated feedback must be vetted by teachers who
can also modify or add feedback to enhance it further.</div>
</div>

<div class="isomer-card-grid">
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Teacher-Integrated Dashboard</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Through the Learning Progress Dashboard, teachers receive data-driven
insights into each student’s progress and concept mastery. This enables
teachers to make informed decisions like recommending specific topics and
curating personalised learning experiences for every student.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Saves Time for More Important Tasks</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">ALS minimises the time teachers spend on routine assessments and administrative
tasks, freeing them up for more meaningful interactions. Teachers can now
focus on building relationships, providing social-emotional support, and
cultivating a holistic learning environment.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Scalability and Subject Expansion</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">ALS is designed to grow, with plans to introduce more topics and levels
across various subjects. This scalability ensures that the system can support
a broader range of learning needs as it evolves.</div>
