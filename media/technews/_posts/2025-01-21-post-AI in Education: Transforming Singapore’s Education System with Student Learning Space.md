<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many schools were forced to shift
to home-based learning to stem the spread of the virus. This led to a greater
necessity to develop more sophisticated and well-rounded online learning
platforms to cater to the students’ learning needs and fulfil the teachers’
desire for more robust options to plan their lesson content and track student
development online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combined with the need to stay up-to-date with the rapid technological
developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Ministry of Education
(MOE) launched the <a href="/products-and-services/for-citizens/education/student-learning-space/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Student Learning Space (SLS)</u></a> in
2018, with substantial and consistent upgrades—including <a href="https://www.learning.moe.edu.sg/ai-in-sls/about-ai-in-sls/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>AI-enabled tools</u></a>—in
its features over the years.</p>
<p>Such efforts are in line with the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/educational-technology-journey/edtech-masterplan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>“Transforming Education through Technology” (EdTech) Masterplan 2030</u></a>,
launched in September 2023 by MOE. This plan envisions "Technology-transformed
learning, to prepare students for a technology-transformed world," reflecting
MOE’s commitment to adapting teaching methods to the digital age. Through
this master plan, MOE seeks to impart students with digital literacy, support
diverse learning needs, and equip students with the skills needed to thrive
in an increasingly complex, tech-driven world.</p>

<div class="isomer-card-description">AI customises learning paths based on each student's strengths, weaknesses,
and learning styles. It then provides adaptive and tailored instruction
that enhances individual understanding and mastery. This allows students
to learn at their own pace with AI as a guiding mentor or tool for them
to use.</div>

<div class="isomer-card-description">AI can bring about greater inclusivity by catering to diverse learning
needs and styles. It can do so by offering content in various formats (visual,
auditory, etc.), speech-to-text, and text-to-speech functions to support
all students, regardless of learning preferences or abilities.</div>
