<p>It’s increasingly arcane to talk about our online and offline lives as
two separate entities. Nowadays, they’re more intertwined than ever and
the lines will only get blurrer in the future.</p>
<p>As such, it’s important to safeguard our personal data. After all, failing
to do so could very well be the reason why you’re pestered by ads and spam
messages in your email and SMS inbox. And it could even lead to far graver
consequences such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/social-engineering#:~:text=Social%20engineering%20attacks%20manipulate%20people,their%20personal%20or%20organizational%20security." class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">social engineering attacks</a>,
where hackers use information about you to trick you into compromising
your cybersecurity.</p>
<p>As we observe Data Privacy Day on January 28, there’s no better time to
learn about how to protect your personal information by avoiding the actions
– which many of us carry out unthinkingly – listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Five ways you might be sabotaging your data privacy:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Clicking "accept all cookies"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not checking if the website is secured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignoring "password compromised" prompts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing anything and everything online</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing all app permissions</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Clicking “accept all cookies”</h3>
<p>It seems like every website you visit has this nowadays – a popup asking
for permission to track cookies. It happens so often that it becomes second
nature to just click “ok”, “yes”, or some variation of consent. If everyone’s
doing it, surely it can’t be that bad, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/information-in-cookies#:~:text=Yes%2C%20most%20cookies%20are%20safe,not%20be%20safe%20to%20accept" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wrong.</a>&nbsp;Cookies
contain your information, including what sites you browse, where you’re
located and even your login information. In the wrong hands, this information
can be used for nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>While it’s generally safe to accept cookies from trusted sites like your
bank’s portal, you should still make it a habit to review the privacy statements
every time a “request for permission” pops out. Be extra careful of third-party
cookies and cookies from unsecured sites.</p>
<p>Some of these pop-ups also have “reject all optional cookies” or “accept
only required cookies” options so that you can easily block all unnecessary
cookies.</p>
<p>It might seem like a chore to review your permissions every time you click
on an inane listicle, but it’ll be a shame to have your data compromised
because you wanted to read an inane listicle and accept cookies on an unsecured
site.</p>
<h3>2. Not checking if the website is secured</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="GovTech website with the lock icon, showing that it is secure" src="/images/technews/Five_ways_you_might_be_sabotaging_your_data_privacy__2_.png">
</div>
<p>Speaking of unsecured sites, always keep a lookout for the&nbsp;<a href="https://it.wisc.edu/news/two-things-to-look-for-in-a-secure-website/#:~:text=A%20secure%20URL%20should%20begin,browser%20to%20the%20website's%20server" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lock icon</a>&nbsp;next
to the URL address in the box where you type the webpage address in, which
indicates that the site is secured by a digital certificate.</p>
<p>Another good indication of a secure and legitimate website is the URL
starting with “https” instead of merely “http”.</p>
<p>Still, scammers are always upping their game and have started to&nbsp;
<a href="https://eecu.org/community/articles/how-to-make-sure-a-website-is-secure#:~:text=When%20you%20go%20to%20a,the%20information%20is%20in%20transit." class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">purchase digital certificates</a>&nbsp;for their spoofed sites as they
know people are likely to trust a site with the lock icon. The result –
there are plenty of fake sites out there with the lock icon too.</p>
<p>So do take care to scrutinise the name of the site in the address bar,
especially when you are about to perform sensitive actions like making
a payment online. Be especially wary of misspellings like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/social-engineering#:~:text=Social%20engineering%20attacks%20manipulate%20people,their%20personal%20or%20organizational%20security." rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ocdc.com</a> or
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/social-engineering#:~:text=Social%20engineering%20attacks%20manipulate%20people,their%20personal%20or%20organizational%20security." rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">shoppee.com</a>which might look legitimate at first glance.</p>
<h3>3. Ignoring “password compromised” prompts</h3>
<p>There are plenty of tools today to help save your passwords so that you
don’t have to remember all of them. Browsers can also save your passwords
and auto-enter them the next time you revisit the website.</p>
<p>Another added benefit is that such password managers often notify you
when your saved credentials have been part of a data leak from the website
in question, or if your credentials have been spotted being put up for
sale to malicious actors.</p>
<p>It’s easy to ignore these notifications, especially when you think to
yourself, “I’m nobody, who would bother to hack me?” Still, it wouldn’t
hurt to investigate further and simply change your password for peace of
mind.</p>
<p>What’s more, password managers can automatically generate new, complex
passwords so that you don’t have to crack your brains to come up with yet
another password. (Also, you won’t fall into the trap of adding “1” behind
your password thinking that makes your password “new”.</p>
<h3>4. Sharing anything and everything online</h3>
<p>We’re in the age of “living for the gram” and documenting every aspect
of our lives online, however mundane and routine.</p>
<p>This leaves a&nbsp;<a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/practice-social-media-safety-to-protect-both-personal-and-enterprise-data/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">rich trail of information</a>&nbsp;for
bad actors to learn about you and glean your personally identifiable information.
Say you record and post a video of you leaving your home and getting to
the airport, boarding your flight to Tokyo, and enjoying your first day
at Disneyland. If you’re not careful, you’ve just given away your home
address, the fact that you’re in Japan, and details of your itinerary.</p>
<p>Scammers may use this information to impersonate you, approaching your
friends to say “you” lost your passport and money overseas, and need their
help in the form of some cash transfers. Your home could become a ripe
target for housebreaking since no one would be there for a few days at
least.</p>
<p>Yes, social media can be fun, but review your posts before publishing
them and scrub them of any clues to your personal data. And those lovely
vacation snaps can wait till after you’re home to be posted.</p>
<h3>5. Allowing all app permissions</h3>
<p>We often get prompts when downloading new apps to allow the app access
to different parts of our device, such as its camera, its location, and
the saved contacts. While some of these are necessary – the Singpass app
needs access to your camera so it can scan QR codes and enable QR code
logins – apps could also request for access that’s not needed.</p>
<p>Take a moment to think if the&nbsp;<a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/app-permissions/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">access request makes sense.</a>&nbsp;You
may end up having photos and videos taken of your surroundings and your
conversations recorded if you allow dubious apps to access your microphone
and camera.</p>
<p>Better yet, set a regular routine, say once a month, to go through all
your app permissions and disable those you deem unnecessary. Another good
practice is to uninstall apps that you haven’t been using. They’re just
sitting there, vacuuming up your data. There’s no need to hoard apps, you
can always reinstall them if you really miss them.</p>
<h3>It’s not paranoia if they’re really after you</h3>
<p>Protecting your personal data can feel a bit like paranoia these days,
having to be on guard against any and everything on your device. But there
are various entities out there vying to gain access to your information.
So some healthy paranoia is definitely called for as we continue to live
an increasing part of our lives online.</p>
<p>The bottom line: you’re doing yourself a favour by staying vigilant and
protecting yourself from being compromised.</p>
