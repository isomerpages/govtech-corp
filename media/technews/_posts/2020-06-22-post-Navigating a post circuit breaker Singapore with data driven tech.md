<h3>As Singapore restarts its economy, data-driven tech solutions will play a crucial role in helping the nation safely and successfully get back on its feet.</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the circuit breaker measures, Singapore has
seen a decline in community COVID-19 cases. As a result, the <a href="https://www.gov.sg/article/ending-circuit-breaker-phased-approach-to-resuming-activities-safely" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government has recently released a roadmap</a> detailing
a three-phase approach to gradually restart the nation’s social and economic
activities.</p>
<p>Singapore’s transition into a “Safe Nation”, however, depends upon successfully
containing any subsequent waves of COVID-19 in the community. In other
words, though the circuit breaker period may be over, it’s no excuse to
let our guard down. Practices that support public health such as safe distancing,
mask-wearing and even remote work should still be maintained for the time
being—and accepted as part and parcel of our new normal.</p>
<p>Within a short matter of months, developments like <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SafeEntry</a> have
shown the potential of data-driven technology in helping us adjust to the
changes brought about in our daily lives by COVID-19. To showcase some
of these other data-driven solutions, the Government Technology Agency
(GovTech) invited developers from three different projects onto a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/STACK-X-by-GovTech-Singapore/events/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">webinar (STACK meetup community)</a> 28
May 2020 to discuss how their solutions address the challenges that could
arise as Singapore safely reopens.</p>
<h3><strong>Staying vigilant</strong></h3>
<p>Temperature screening stations have become a regular sight at public spots
across Singapore. Though these systems can automatically take body temperatures,
dedicated staff must still be deployed to analyse the temperature readings
and take action if needed. Many smaller companies and organisations, however,
cannot afford to delegate temperature screening due to manpower limitations.
In addition, current temperature screening systems have been described
as inefficient, even <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-long-queues-formed-at-suntec-city-and-raffles-place-on-first-day-of" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">causing long waiting times</a> and
queues during their initial implementation.</p>
<p>“When DORSCON Orange was first announced and temperature screening was
implemented, building owners told us that they faced issues with manpower
and screening efficiency,” said Mr Delon Leonard, an AI engineer from the
video analytics team at the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division
(DSAID) of GovTech. “To address these issues, we wanted to create a solution
that could control entry across each screening station while minimising
staff deployments.”</p>
<p>That premise soon developed into the fully-automated, contactless <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/how-gt-developed-fit-for-purpose-temperature-scanners-part-2system" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VigilantGantry</a>,
which combines a video camera, thermal sensor and a gantry system. Through
its video analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) framework, the system
checks for two things: First, if a visitor’s face is sufficiently exposed
to make an accurate measurement; and second, if the visitor has a fever.
Should either of these checks fail, the gantry will restrict access.</p>
<p>By leveraging technology to assume the responsibilities of a human operator,
VigilantGantry will help to solve their manpower crunch, said Mr Leonard.
At the moment, VigilantGantry has been deployed at some institutes of higher
learning and government agencies.</p>

<h3><strong>A way around the crowds</strong></h3>
<p>Essential services have operated continuously throughout Covid-19 period
in Singapore to meet people’s needs. These include many retail malls, supermarkets,
markets, banks, and post offices, among others. Measures to ensure safe
distancing included guidelines on having physical separation of 1m between
people for all services, and a cap of no more than 1 visitor per 16 square
meters of usable space for retail malls.</p>
<p>While these retail operators implement the measures on ground, information
on their crowd levels are not readily available to the general public.
Such information can help people make more informed choices on where or
when to go to avoid crowds before they head out. Through this, it can also
help relieve some pressure popular retail outlets face in crowd management.</p>
<p>“We collaborated with operators to bring together their crowd level information
of malls, supermarkets, markets, and post offices and made it available
to the public through <a href="https://www.spaceout.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.SpaceOut.gov.sg</a>. This was designed
to be an easy-to-use, map-based website that people can access on any digital
device.” said Ms Jazreel Siew, a Systems Analyst at the Digital Planning
Lab of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) of Singapore.</p>
<p>The website shows both near-real time crowd level information for malls
that are able to provide it, as well as analytics on recent trends of crowd
levels. People can also easily search for less crowded options nearby.</p>
<p>“Building Space Out was a very exciting and meaningful opportunity for
me. The team designed and built the website in less than a week, and we
had to develop solutions to bring together different data formats from
various partners. We were able to bring our experience in developing geospatial
analytics solutions for urban planning in partnership with operators, to
develop convenient solutions that can help everyone in Singapore stay safer
during Covid-19 period.” Ms Siew said.</p>

<h3><strong>Upgrading man’s best friend</strong></h3>
<p>Perhaps in the near future when you visit your neighbourhood park for
a walk, you may notice dog-like robots patrolling the route, reminding
you to observe safe distancing. The Smart Nation Platform Solutions (SNPS)
team from GovTech had recently concluded a two-week trial of Boston Dynamics’
four-legged robot SPOT at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in May for safe distancing
operations.</p>
<p>Since before the COVID-19 pandemic, the team has been building a mobile
sensor platform capable of collecting data and carrying out operations
autonomously in different environments. “The whole idea was to have a robot
packed full of sensors to bring in data, which is why we picked Spot® as
the model for our robot,” said Mr Lim Chinn Hwa, Senior Director of the
SNPS group. The SNPS team augmented Spot® with software capabilities such
as remote control, 3D mapping and semi-autonomous operations, which enabled
SPOT to be deployed for COVID-19 related operations.</p>
<p>“One of the places where we deployed Spot® was at the Changi Exhibition
Centre, where it was trialled for delivering critical medical supplies
from the green zone to the red zone,” said Mr Chong Jia Yi, the engineer
who heads the SNPS robotics team. The reason for using Spot® in this context,
he said, was to keep medical personnel safe. After all, entering the red
zone entails a tedious process of dressing up in personal protective equipment
(PPE). As Mr Chong recounts, there are times when tired medical personnel
could inadvertently expose themselves to virus particles in the air.</p>
<p>Besides Changi, Spot® is also being trialled at the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio
Park, where it uses deep-learning algorithms developed by the SNPS team
to detect if safe distancing is observed among visitors. The team is currently
working to make the augmented Spot® fully autonomous.</p>
