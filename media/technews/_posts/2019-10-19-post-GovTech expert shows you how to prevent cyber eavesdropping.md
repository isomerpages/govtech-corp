<h3>Electromagnetic radiation emitted from electronic devices could compromise privacy and security. GovTech‚Äôs Mr Tan Peng Chong shares how organisations can better protect their digital assets from external eavesdropping and influence.</h3>
<p>An antenna, a radio device and a laptop; innocuous as these objects may
seem, in the right (or wrong) hands, they can be assembled into a formidable
tool for eavesdropping. Mr Tan Peng Chong, principal cybersecurity specialist
at the Government Agency of Technology (GovTech) Singapore, knows this
all too well.</p>
<p>Tasked with securing government assets against cyber threats, he has experimented
with the numerous methods that hackers may use to obtain private information
illicitly.</p>
<p>During a brown bag seminar at GovTech‚Äôs Mapletree Business City headquarters,
Peng Chong demonstrated precisely how a malicious actor could remotely
view what a victim is doing on a computer screen using‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîan
antenna, a radio device and a laptop.</p>
<p>Configuring those contraptions, Peng Chong was able to mirror the screen
of another computer in the room on his laptop. Any action performed on
the would-be victim‚Äôs computer was now visible to him in real-time.</p>
<h3><strong>Tuning in to the right channel</strong></h3>
<p>So, how did Peng Chong do it? Put simply, electronic devices emit electromagnetic
(EM) radiation when they process information. This radiation propagates
like radio waves that are used for television or radio broadcasting.</p>
<p>The principle is simple: any electrical current flowing through a conductive
wire generates an EM field. ‚ÄúWhenever devices switch bits‚Äîfrom zero to
one, one to zero‚Äîthey subtly emit EM waves,‚Äù Peng Chong explained. ‚Äú[These
waves] can be picked up and used to reconstruct the information that the
devices were processing].‚Äù</p>
<p>So, in a sense, most devices broadcast their activities to the world,
albeit with very faint signals. The technology to tap into EM emissions
has, in fact, been available since World War I, deployed by military forces
to listen in on the enemy‚Äôs communications over field telephones.</p>
<p>Although commercial electronics are seldom designed to protect against
[EM emission-based] surveillance, Peng Chong notes that many consumer electronic
devices today run on much lower voltages, which means that their EM emissions
are generally much less obvious. A spy or hacker would, therefore, need
more sensitive antennas and related equipment or be within closer range
of their victims to siphon off private information.</p>
<h3>Plugging the emission leak</h3>
<p>Peng Chong indicated three possible countermeasures for those concerned
about becoming victims of such attacks: shielding, filtering and masking.
While all three approaches may sound similar, they differ in their implementation.
Like most cyber defence strategies, there is no one-size-fits-all solution,
and each person or organisation will have to decide for themselves which
strategy‚Äîor combination of strategies‚Äîis most suitable for their applications,
after factoring in the risks, cost and usability.</p>
<h3>Evolving emission security threats</h3>
<p>Besides remote surveillance at a system level, Peng Chong said that an
emerging cybersecurity concern is the exploitation of EM radiation at a
microscopic level onto small security components such as the Trusted Platform
Module. Moving from passive EM eavesdropping, a new dimension is the exploitation
through injecting EM faults into the security components. If successful,
the fault could reveal further vulnerabilities to a hacker or even allow
the hacker to recover cryptographic keys.</p>
