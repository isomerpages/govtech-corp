<p>HealthHub is Singapore’s first one-stop online health information and
services portal, with a mobile application too.</p>
<p>Ms Lena Lee, Senior IT Consultant, Chief Information Officer’s Office
at HPB said: “HealthHub provides Singaporeans 24/7 secured access to reliable
localised and citizen-centric content, personalised health records, medical
listings, rewards and deals.”</p>
<p>The portal's development started in May 2014, as a means of encouraging
the adoption of healthy habits and to nudge Singaporeans to take greater
ownership of their own health and wellness.</p>
<p>Patients from Public Healthcare Institutions benefit from the convenience
offered by HealthHub: They can access useful information such as hospital
discharge summary, lab test results, screening records and view medical
appointments across public healthcare institutions.</p>
<p>Parents, too, can benefit: They can view their children’s health records,
such as immunisation records, dental health records and referral letters.</p>
<h3><strong>A host of health data</strong></h3>
<p>Putting HealthHub together was an immense and complex task.</p>
<p>One of the challenges that the team faced — and overcame with sheer hard
work — was the task of integrating data across many IT systems from all
of the public hospitals and clinics, before displaying on HealthHub.</p>
<p>The information presented within HealthHub is drawn from multiple sources
such as the NEHR (National Electronic Health Record) System, School Health
System, School Dental System and National Immunisation Registry, which
integrates and shares medical records nationwide to support the seamless
delivery of patient care, and the NIR (National Immunisation Registry),
which monitors and ensures that every child in Singapore gets his or her
immunisation at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the information on these platforms is updated regularly by
clinicians.</p>
<p>But the team (main photo, above) persevered, and the results were well
worth it.</p>
<p>As of end January 2017, the HealthHub website has had 8.5 million page
views — and over 84,000 Singaporeans have downloaded the app, to receive
health-related information and use online services to better manage their
health condition.</p>
<p>For the team, the popularity of HealthHub is an indication that Singaporeans
view it as a useful tool to access health-related content, key medical
records and e-services — and that it is important to continually provide
HealthHub users the latest relevant information on health topics, as well
as news and announcements, to keep them engaged.</p>
<h3><strong>Caring for Caregivers</strong></h3>
<p>The HealthHub team continued to listen to feedback in order to improve
the portal.</p>
<p>Ms Lee said: “A common request that the HealthHub team received following
the launch was to give caregivers the option to access health and medical
records of the loved ones in their care.”</p>
<p>She noted that caregivers have a 24/7 responsibility that often leave
them time-starved on a daily basis. Many caregivers had to juggle between
the competing demands of caring for their young children and their ageing
parents, and often relied on their extended family or domestic workers
for help.</p>
<p>Hence, HealthHub introduced the Caregiver Access Module in 2016, allowing
patients to grant consent to their designated caregivers to view their
personal health and upcoming medical appointments.</p>
<p>The enhancement can potentially help caregivers to better manage and care
for their patients by providing convenience and administrative support
on tasks such as record keeping and monitoring, as well as appointment
tracking.</p>
<p>“For the first time, individuals have the choice to share viewing access
of their personal health records with their designated caregivers to facilitate
them in their care management.”</p>
<p>This feature is available for all Singaporeans and PRs age 21 years old
and above, using SingPass to access and grant consent through HealthHub.</p>
<p>And public feedback continues to be the powerful engine that drives the
development roadmap.</p>
<p>Ms Lee confirmed: “As we continue to build up this citizen-centric portal,
we will incorporate feedback received in subsequent releases, so that HealthHub
becomes increasingly useful to Singaporeans. With the help of user inputs,
HealthHub aims to develop into a 'must-have' digital companion for healthy
living for Singaporeans.”</p>
