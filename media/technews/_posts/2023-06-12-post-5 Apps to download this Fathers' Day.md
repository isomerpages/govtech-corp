<p>Happy Father‚Äôs Day in advance! (Or belated, depending on when you read
this article)</p>
<p>Parenthood brings its fair share of challenges and responsibilities. Fortunately,
we live in an age where technology can lend a helping hand, especially
in Singapore.</p>
<p>Just using your smartphone, you can access a whole collection of apps
that are here to make a father‚Äôs life a little easier. And it‚Äôs not just
about daddy duties, there are also apps that will help a dad recharge and
have some fun!</p>
<p>The GovTech team (which includes some fathers) has picked out our favourite
apps for your reference.</p>
<h3>1. HealthHub</h3>
<p>Part of being a dad is making sure everyone in the family is healthy.
HealthHub, developed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), helps you do that
effortlessly.</p>
<p>You can easily access health records, find nearby healthcare providers,
and stay on top of vaccination schedules. Take charge of your family‚Äôs
well-being with ease and convenience.</p>
<p>With the time saved from admin, fathers can go ahead and do stuff that
they want to to do, like playing their favourite sport or just chilling
out with a quiet coffee.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to those old-school health booklets!</p>
<h3>2. MyTransport</h3>
<p>Taking a taxi or ride-hailing service is convenient, but this convenience
comes at a price!</p>
<p>With the help of the MyTransport app, you can plan your trip and save
some money for the whole family.</p>
<p>MyTransport is your ultimate companion for real-time updates on public
transport services: Check bus arrival timings, train schedules, and service
disruptions to ensure smooth and efficient journeys.</p>
<p>That means no more guessing games at the bus stop, shorter waiting times,
and hopefully less restlessness amongst the little ones.</p>
<h3>3. LifeSG</h3>
<p>Juggling multiple responsibilities as a dad can be challenging, but the
LifeSG app is here to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>This super-app offers a wide range of government services and information
in one convenient platform.</p>
<p>The app provides frictionless and delightful access to digital government
services ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs something as momentous as registering your child‚Äôs
birth or as routine as receiving your NS55 credits.</p>
<p>From healthcare and housing to education and e-services, you can easily
access various resources to streamline your interactions with government
agencies.</p>
<p>By spending less time on paperwork and processes, you get to spend more
time creating memories with your loved ones.</p>
<h3>4. ActiveSG</h3>
<p>What‚Äôs the saying again? A workout a day keeps the dad bod away. (Editor‚Äôs
note: It‚Äôs never too late to work out. Ed has a dad bod, he should start.)</p>
<p>To get the most amount of meaningful time with your loved ones, you‚Äôll
need to maintain a healthy lifestyle. For more strenuous tasks like chasing
a 2 year old toddler, you will need to get that training in to get that
stamina up.</p>
<p>The ActiveSG app is your go-to fitness companion, offering a plethora
of sports facilities, activity bookings, and fitness programs suitable
for the whole family.</p>
<p>Whether it‚Äôs swimming sessions, badminton matches, or energising fitness
classes, you can keep your family active and engaged in a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<h3>5. NParks</h3>
<p>If working out in a gym is not for you, then why not take a walk in nature?
That‚Äôs where the NParks app comes in.</p>
<p>Explore Singapore‚Äôs beautiful green spaces, parks, and nature reserves
with your family. Discover hidden gems, plan outdoor adventures, and join
guided walks to create lasting memories. From picnics in the park to wildlife
spotting and serene nature trails, NParks has got you covered.</p>
<p>As much as we like all things tech, sometimes you need to unplug from
the digital world and immerse yourselves in the beauty of nature.</p>
<p>So whether it is a solo adventure hike for dad, or a family day out in
the sun, make sure you have the NParks app packed away.</p>
<h3>Happy Father‚Äôs Day!</h3>
<p>As Father‚Äôs Day approaches, let‚Äôs celebrate the incredible dads in Singapore
and their unwavering dedication to their families.</p>
<p>These apps not only make fatherhood more manageable but also enhance the
bond between fathers and their children.</p>
<p>By utilising technology and harnessing the power of these apps, fathers
can streamline their daily routines, prioritise their family‚Äôs health,
and create lasting memories.</p>
<p>Happy Father‚Äôs Day from all of us at GovTech!</p>
