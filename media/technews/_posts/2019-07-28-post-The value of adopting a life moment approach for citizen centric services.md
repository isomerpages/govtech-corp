<h3>At the Public Sector Transformation Conference, a panel of experts shared the benefits that organisations can reap from taking a life-moment approach in the design of services.</h3>
<p>By now, you‚Äôve probably heard about Industry 4.0, where digitalisation,
data and automation are shaking up the way organisations operate. Less
talked about is the concept of Services 4.0, which challenges leaders to
shift their focus beyond just technical capabilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúServices 4.0 is about being end to end, thinking about the whole customer
journey and making it frictionless, smooth and seamless,‚Äù explained Ms
Jane Lim, assistant chief executive of the Info-communications Media Development
Authority (IMDA) at a cross-agency panel discussion titled ‚ÄòThe Value of
Adopting a Life-Moment Approach for Citizen-Centric Services.‚Äô</p>
<p>The sharing session was part of the Public Sector Transformation Conference
held at Our Tampines Hub on 18 July 2019. Ms Lim was joined on the panel
by Mr Dominic Chan, director of the Moments of Life platform, Government
Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech); Mr Eugene Toh, director of the
Pro-Enterprise Division at the Ministry of Trade and Industry; and Mr Tan
Chia Han, assistant commissioner of police, Singapore Police Force.</p>

<h4>Keep it simple, seamless</h4>
<p>At its core, a life-moment approach to creating digital services involves
mapping out all of a customer‚Äôs interactions with an organisation at a
specific time of need, effectively creating a customer journey. In doing
so, organisations can ‚Äúuntie knots in policies and processes [and encourage]
collaboration across different agencies [or business units],‚Äù said Mr Chan.</p>
<p>This is very different from how the government used to operate, noted
Mr Toh, adding that services for citizens tended to be organised along
agency lines. ‚ÄúProcesses were pretty efficient within each agency‚Ä¶ but
there were gaps in the way the customer journey flowed between agencies,‚Äù
he said, illustrating his point by highlighting how cumbersome it used
to be for prospective restaurateurs to establish their businesses.</p>
<p>Before the government adopted a life-moment approach, a would-be restaurant
owner had to approach the Urban Redevelopment Authority to obtain a change-of-use
permit for a premise, the Singapore Food Authority to get a food shop license,
the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority to incorporate the business,
and so on. In total, there were 14 separate touchpoints spanning multiple
agencies, making for a frustrating experience when interacting with the
government.</p>
<p>All this changed with the life-moment approach. With some process re-engineering
around the client [prospective restaurant owners], MTI was able to cut
down 845 fields that needed to be filled into about 90 and reduced the
entire application process to a single touchpoint. This led to tangible
benefits for applicants, such as cost savings from not having to pay certain
fees and less time spent on each transaction. ‚ÄúHopefully, this leaves enterprise
owners with a better experience when carrying out regulatory transactions
with the government,‚Äù he quipped.</p>
<h4>Personal, predictive and preventive</h4>
<p>Yet another advantage that the life-moment approach brings to organisations
is the ability to personalise its services. A company may offer its clients
many products, but not all of those products are relevant to each customer.
In the context of government digital services, for instance, young parents
who just welcomed a new child into their lives would need different services
from an elderly person.</p>
<p>‚Äú[For example] we can use citizen information that [the government] has
collected and stored on MyInfo to understand citizens, make recommendations
to them, as well as personalise services for them,‚Äù Mr Chan elaborated.
‚ÄúTo drive this, we have to build new capabilities in data analytics, machine
learning, and deep learning.‚Äù</p>
<p>In addition to personalisation, Ms Lim emphasised that the life-moment
approach towards provision of services could allow organisations to predict
clients‚Äô needs and prevent problems from happening. ‚ÄúThat will be the way
forward to provide a delightful experience and lower the friction for users,‚Äù
she said.</p>
<h4>Tapping into a supportive ecosystem</h4>
<p>Delighting users sometimes requires finding synergies with partners outside
your organisation, and this should be embraced rather than feared, said
the panel. Ms Lim made the case for such partnerships with the example
of how banks can now tap on MyInfo to onboard customers more efficiently.</p>
<p>Mr Tan also experienced the effectiveness of playing off the strengths
of partners during his secondment to Lazada, which is owned by China‚Äôs
Alibaba Group. ‚ÄúThe Alibaba ecosystem is bigger than just Alibaba alone.
It consists of Alibaba, buyers, merchants, logistics service providers
and professional service providers, including companies that help merchants
list and market their products, as well as manage their inventories and
customer feedback, on e-commerce platforms.‚Äù</p>
<p>A life-moment approach could, therefore, help organisations identify specific
areas in their operations for partners to value-add to, ultimately resulting
in better customer experiences and, perhaps, even new business opportunities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFinally, it‚Äôs crucial not to shy away from customer engagement. For example,
Lazada frequently hosts seller conferences, where the managers meet up
with the merchants in person to share the latest initiatives, hear their
feedback and understand their pain points. Customer feedback channels are
prompt and responsive, and feedback is treated seriously,‚Äù Mr Tan said.</p>
