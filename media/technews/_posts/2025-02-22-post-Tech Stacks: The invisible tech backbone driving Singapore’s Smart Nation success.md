<p>Just as we need homes to live in, digital and tech properties need real
estate too. After all, digital applications need stable environments to
function reliably. Without such a foundation, even the most cutting-edge
software wouldn’t be able to perform smoothly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Creating a viable space for these services is essential in Singapore’s
Smart Nation journey, where 99% of all government transactions are completed
online. Recognising this early on, Singapore developed the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/software-development/government-on-commercial-cloud/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC)</a> –
a robust, secure environment where our essential public services live and
thrive. This is the foundation of the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/software-development/sg-tech-stack/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)</a>,
a robust ecosystem that supports the design, development, and deployment
of digital services seamlessly.</p>

<h3>A safe and standardised foundation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>While cloud computing isn’t new, the GCC is a step above the typical commercial
cloud. Designed to meet a digital government’s stringent security and operational
needs, the GCC is like the “land” where all the government’s digital flats,
or applications, are built.</p>
<p>When constructing physical buildings, the land is first prepped, and infrastructure
such as electricity and plumbing is put in place. The GCC does the same
for developers—it provides a stable base for them to work on, freeing them
from repeatedly setting up core infrastructure and worrying about compliance
with government standards and security gaps.</p>
<p>This analogy extends beyond just foundational work. Once the “land” is
ready, developers can focus on the “interior design”: customising applications
and services to meet specific needs. One example is <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/service-delivery/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GatherSG</a>,
a case management tech stack that optimises inter-agency collaboration.
It&nbsp;enables developers to skip foundational tasks like sourcing infrastructure
and instead focus on the user experience, which sped up deployment.</p>
<p>Today, more than 80% of eligible Government systems have been migrated
to the GCC, with plans for all eligible systems to transition over time.
This centralised cloud foundation brings consistency, cost savings, and
reduced setup times for new applications. For example, when COVID-19 hit,
and urgent digital solutions were needed to track and respond to the crisis,
the GCC enabled developers to deploy updates swiftly.</p>
<h3>Urban planning for efficient use of resources</h3>
<p>Just as Singapore’s urban planning balances utility and beauty, the SGTS’s
digital neighbourhood ensures different “blocks” or systems come together
harmoniously. This coordinated planning is crucial because, in digital
ecosystems, multiple agencies often need to use certain tools and technologies.
Without a common platform, each agency would develop its own infrastructure,
leading to redundancies.</p>
<p>Tech stacks help solve this issue by standardising core technologies.
Within the SGTS, tools like <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/devops/ship-hats/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SHIP-HATS</a> for
source code management, C-Stack for containerisation, and <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/data-and-apis/apex-cloud/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">APEX </a>for
API management act as essential digital infrastructure. Instead of agencies
building their own tools, they tap into these shared resources, saving
time and reducing costs. The result? Much faster deployment of digital
services. For instance, <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/government-transactions/singpass-api/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Singpass's MyInfo</a>’s
launch time was cut from a year to just four months, thanks to SGTS.</p>
<h3>Fostering collaboration and innovation</h3>
<p>Having a common platform also enables seamless knowledge sharing through
inner sourcing. Similar to open source but within the government, inner
sourcing allows developers across agencies to share code, templates, and
best practices. This collaborative model reduces duplication of efforts
and accelerates development timelines.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inner sourcing also applies to design through the <a href="https://www.designsystem.tech.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)</a>,
which provides shared design components that agencies can use, ensuring
that government applications have a consistent and user-friendly interface.
Designers can contribute&nbsp; to SGDS, creating a feedback loop of continual
improvement.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Evolving with the future</h3>
<p>As technology evolves, so does the stack. One of the upcoming focus areas
is integrating <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-ways-you-are-already-using-ai/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to
boost developer productivity. AI-powered coding assistants and automation
tools are being explored to optimise the software development process further.
The goal isn’t to replace developers but to augment their capabilities,
allowing smaller teams to achieve more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another area of focus is system resilience. It is crucial to ensure digital
services remain available and responding quickly on the rare occasion when
systems are down. SGTS’s future enhancements will address these needs so
that public confidence in public digital services stays strong.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The invisible backbone of Singapore’s digital success&nbsp;</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Just as Singapore’s well-planned neighbourhoods contribute to its liveability,
the SGTS underpins our digital excellence. Invisible to most, it’s the
hidden engine that powers everything from <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CPF services</a> to career support and upskilling
resources. By centralising infrastructure and fostering collaboration,
the SGTS ensures Singapore stays ahead in its <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/our-enhanced-smart-nation-vision-paving-the-way-for-a-new-digital-era/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation journey</a>.</p>
