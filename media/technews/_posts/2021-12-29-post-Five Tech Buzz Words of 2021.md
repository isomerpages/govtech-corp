<h3>5G network</h3>
<p>The promise of super-fast mobile internet in the form of 5G has been around
for some time, but this year was when it got closer to reality here in
Singapore.</p>
<p>Consumers may be getting as many as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/singtel-m1-starhub-tie-up-and-tpg-provisionally-awarded-21-ghz-spectrum-rights-for-5g" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">three standalone 5G networks</a>&nbsp;to
choose from, thanks to an awarding of network spectrum rights to Singtel,
an M1-Starhub consortium, and TPG.</p>
<p>They are aiming to deploy 5G with 50 per cent coverage within 2 years
and nationwide coverage within five years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/media-releases/2021-10-20-first-batch-of-public-sector-5g-trials-at-sentosa-underway" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sentosa has been serving as a testbed</a>&nbsp;for
trials of 5G’s application in public sector projects. The Building and
Construction Authority and National Environment Agency were among the first
government agencies to leverage low latency 5G for trials involving fully
autonomous robots, tele-operated vehicles, and augmented reality.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p>Wait a minute, haven’t electric vehicles, or EVs, been around for quite
a few years already? True that. But 2021 was the year that Tesla, perhaps
the most well-known EV maker, opened a sales portal in Singapore.</p>
<p>Singapore has been pushing to upgrade its infrastructure to support the
adoption of EVs. This year, government agencies&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Media-Room/Media-Releases/pr21-31" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">awarded the pilot tender</a>&nbsp;for
EV charging points in public car parks across the island.</p>
<p>Starting September 2021, more than 600 EV chargers will be deployed at
over 200 car parks in locations such as public housing and industrial estates,
public parks, community centres and the Central Business District over
the next 12 months. Singapore aims to outfit 40,000 charging points in
public car parks by 2030.</p>
<h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
<p>It’s up, it’s down, it’s going all around. That sums up the story of Bitcoin,
the cryptocurrency that has made multimillionaires out of some early adopters
and captured the world’s attention.</p>
<p>It hit a new milestone this year as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034838909/bitcoin-el-salvador-legal-tender-official-currency-cryptocurrency" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">El Salvador</a>&nbsp;became
the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, an alternative to
its other currency, the US dollar. The country’s president argued that
the move would spur investment in the country and help 70 per cent of the
El Salvadorans who don’t have access to traditional financial services.
Whether the bold experiment will succeed is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/world/americas/bitcoin-el-salvador-bukele.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">still up in the air</a>,
and the world is watching for clues about cryptocurrencies’ future.</p>
<p>Back home, Singapore is aiming to be a leading player in the global crypto
economy. The Monetary Authority said that it s putting in place&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/singapore-has-grand-ambitions-to-become-a-global-crypto-hub" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“strong regulation”</a>, so firms that meet its requirements and address
the multitude of risks in one of the fastest-growing areas of finance.</p>
<p>And Singapore is not the only country in Southeast Asia with its eye on
the potential of crypto. Thailand is paving the way for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-28/thailand-lays-groundwork-for-crypto-tourism-to-revive-industry" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">acceptance of digital currency</a>&nbsp;for
travel so that tourists with crypto will find it convenient to spend and
provide much-needed support to its pandemic-hit tourism industry.</p>
<h3>Metaverse</h3>
<p>The metaverse entered the everyday lexicon thanks to Facebook’s renaming
itself&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-company-name-to-meta.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Meta</a>&nbsp;and
announcing its ambition to chart the next era of online behaviour by establishing
a metaverse where humans can live, work, and play as an extension of the
physical world.&nbsp;<a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/2021-was-the-year-of-the-metaverse-but-itll-take-years-before-its-a-reality-170559280.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Other tech giants like Microsoft</a>&nbsp;also
outlined their plans to make the metaverse a reality.</p>
<p>What might the metaverse look like? Right now, it’s anyone’s guess, as
it’s more a notion than a definition. Possibilities abound at this point,
which is what makes it exciting and what makes it look like a potential
pot of gold to different companies competing to establish the number one
metaverse playground.</p>
<p>It also seems fitting that the fourth Matrix movie dropped this year,
given that the first Matrix was a groundbreaking film featuring a sinister
version of total immersion in a digital reality.</p>
<h3>NFTs</h3>
<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, announced its arrival in the mainstream
when a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">jpeg NFT</a>&nbsp;sold
for US$69 million.</p>
<p>These uniquely tokenised objects reside in the digital world and are recorded
in the blockchain, ensuring that they are one of a kind, giving them value
derived from scarcity. By the first half of the year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nft-sales-volume-surges-25-bln-2021-first-half-2021-07-05/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">US$2.5 billion of NFTs have been sold</a>,
ranging from digital artwork, to GIFs, to basketball highlights.</p>
<h3>New trend or flash in the pan?</h3>
<p>With all things digital new, there is huge potential to be a game changer,
and there is also the chance that it’s just the equivalent of a shooting
star, burning bright but also burning out quickly.</p>
<p>Which of these buzzwords will have staying power? Only time will tell
and we’ll be sure to keep our eyes on them to see what the next chapter
holds.</p>
