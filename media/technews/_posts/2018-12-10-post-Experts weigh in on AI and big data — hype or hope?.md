<p>TL:DR: Society is generating ever-larger datasets through the use of connected
devices. Artificial intelligence (AI) is thus becoming an important analytical
tool for organisations to better understand their client base. Operational
objectives aside, the societal impact of AI must also be considered, said
speakers at the Big Data &amp; AI 2018 conference.</p>
<hr>
<p>The world is awash with data—some 2.5 quintillion bytes of it, generated
every day. Each click, tap and swipe on a smartphone screen generates a
data point, and every surveillance camera and sensor adds to an already
burgeoning library of digital information. Big data looks set to get even
bigger in the years ahead, making the case for artificial intelligence
(AI) to take on an even bigger role in industry and society.</p>
<p>At the Big Data &amp; AI Asia 2018 conference, a panel of experts convened
to discuss the question, “How will big data and AI shape up in 2019?”.
Moderated by Mr Graham Brown, chairman of Asia Tech Podcast, the panel
comprised Mr Devadas Krishnadas, CEO, Future-Moves Group; Dr Cao Hong,
head of data science, Ernst &amp; Young; Mr Johnson Poh, head of data science,
DBS Bank; Mr Sanjay Bakshi, head of digital transformation and ventures,
Shell; Mr Victor Tay, managing partner, Stout (Asia) Advisory Limited;
and Mr Vivek Kumar, director, National Trades Union Congress, Singapore.</p>
<h3>Keeping an eye on the prize</h3>
<p>Like the flavours of ice cream, AI solutions come in a variety of forms,
and this diversity is likely to increase in the year ahead. However, Mr
Tay noted that many AI applications are “solutions looking for problems”,
suggesting that their practical use cases have yet to be identified. Despite
this, the hype surrounding AI is tremendous. “Between 2014 and 2016 alone,
we saw a 400 percent growth in valuation in the [AI and big data] space,”
he said.</p>
<p>Agreeing with Mr Tay, Mr Bakshi added that it is easy to become distracted
in this time of optimistic innovation. Business leaders must therefore
constantly ask themselves: “Just because other companies are doing things
in a certain way, does it mean that their approach is relevant to me?”
he said.</p>
<p>Given the lack of a one-size-fits-all solution, Dr Cao recommended that
business leaders clearly define the tangible outcomes that they want to
achieve with AI and big data. This could help them come up with better
roadmaps for the adoption of emerging technologies.</p>
<h3>Shaping the future of technology</h3>
<p>While there is no denying that AI and big data can help governments and
businesses derive economic benefits, the impact on the labour market must
also be considered. Mr Kumar emphasised that AI, being a tool of the fourth
industrial revolution, must be wielded by the “worker 4.0”. This means
that upskilling and retraining will be necessary.</p>
<p>The notion of worker empowerment struck a chord with Mr Poh, who proposed
an alternative strategy for narrowing the skills gap—make AI analytics
tools easy to use. “We [DBS] take a very product-centric view of the entire
data and AI process… [We strive to create] products and platforms to empower
employees, whether they be data scientists or business analysts, to build
and test their own data models.”</p>
<p>Finally, there is a need for regulation to keep pace with innovation.
Although this task is often left to the government, Mr Krishnadas called
for industry players and citizens to participate in shaping legislation
pertaining to AI and big data.</p>
<p>“Your data and behaviour are helping to create the conditions of technology
that then become the conditions for humanity. I think its important that
we ask ourselves what needs to change on the structural and institutional
side to accommodate, in a more responsible and stable way, the changes
that technology will bring,” he said.</p>
