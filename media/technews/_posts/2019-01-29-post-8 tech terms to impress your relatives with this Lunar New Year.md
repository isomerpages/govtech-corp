<h3>Want to make small talk with relatives during the Lunar New Year celebrations? Steer the conversation away from awkward topics and impress everyone with our handy list of 8 tech terms that are relevant to everyone’s lives.</h3>
<p>It’s that time of the year again when bak gua prices suddenly soar, dieting
plans go out the window and the young or unmarried look forward to an unofficial
bonus contained in a stack of angbaos. This lunar new year season, as you
meet up with members of your great-grandparents’ extended bloodline, why
not use the following eight (huat ah!) tech buzzwords to strike up some
interesting conversations?</p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Artificial Intelligence" src="/images/technews/8-tech-terms-to-impress-your-relatives-with-this-lunar-new-year-part1.png">
</div>
<h3>AI - Artificial Intelligence (人工智能 Réngōng zhìnéng)</h3>
<p>No, this is not the Hanyu Pinyin of the title of that Taiwanese soap opera
from almost a decade ago. AI stands for artificial intelligence, and you
can tell your relatives that it refers to machines that can think and learn
to perform specific functions. As an illustration of the technology, whip
out your latest iPhone and ask Siri for the weather, or demonstrate how
e-commerce websites know how to recommend things that you like. All these
applications require AI, and the odds are everyone is already using AI
in one form or another.</p>

</div>
<h3>Big Data (大数据 Dàshùjù)</h3>
<p>Prosperity and abundance are key themes of Lunar New Year wishes. But
something else has become extremely abundant in this digital age—data.
It has been estimated that by 2025, the amount of data accumulated worldwide
will amount to 175 zettabytes, or 175 trillion gigabytes. Such huge datasets
represent a treasure trove of insights into human behaviour. Unsurprisingly,
governments and companies are keen to analyse such datasets to develop
better products and services for citizens and clients.</p>

</div>
<h3>Cybersecurity (网络安全 Wǎngluò ānquán)</h3>
<p>With increasing digitalisation comes a higher risk of cyber attacks. Computer
viruses or malware are rampant in cyberspace, so remind all your relatives
to update the antivirus software on their smartphones, tablets and laptops
when you see them this lunar new year! The only fish that you want in your
life now is the sliced one in your yusheng, not fishy business involving
your social media accounts, so click on <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/cybersecurity-tips-everyone-can-use" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">these</a> 
<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/5-cybersecurity-tips-from-huawei-chief-cybersecurity-officer" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">links</a>to find out how to steer clear of phishing attempts and keep
cybercriminals at bay.</p>

</div>
<h3>Digital Identity (数码身份认证 Shùmǎ shēnfèn rènzhèng)</h3>
<p>Festive seasons like the lunar new year are often a time for spring cleaning.
Looking back, you’ve probably had countless user IDs and passwords over
the years. How about a day when you don't need to remember more than just
one? The upcoming National Digital Identity programme aims to streamline
your access to public and private sector services (one ID to rule them
all!).</p>
<p>As part of the NDI programme, citizens can log in using their fingerprint
or facial recognition (for selected phones) with the new <a href="https://singpassmobile.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SingPass Mobile app</a> (电子政府密码应用).
New features will be added to the app soon. These include a dashboard that
allows you to view all your relevant personal information (e.g. CPF balance,
passport expiry date) at one glance!</p>

</div>
<h3>E-payments (电子支付 Diànzǐ zhīfù)</h3>
<p>The giving of angbaos or red packets containing money is an age-old Chinese
tradition. In recent years, however, some financial service providers have
introduced the digital or e-angbao, so you can tell your uncles or aunties
that next year, maybe they won’t have to carry physical red packets around
anymore! Also, with the rollout of the <a href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/sgqr/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SGQR code</a>, which simplifies
transactions between consumers and merchants, and PayNow, which serves
as a unified platform for online fund transfers, going cashless in Singapore
is easier than ever before. Having said that, if you’re on the receiving
end of angbaos, physical or digital, good for you!</p>

</div>
<h3>Moments of Life (人生旅程助手 Rénshēng lǚchéng zhùshǒu)</h3>
<p>Whether you’re setting up a family, a company, or caring for an ageing
parent - we all hope for a smooth process and year ahead. To support citizens
through these important phases of life, GovTech has launched family-centric
apps such as the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-key-features-of-the-new-moments-of-life-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Moments of Life (Families) mobile app</a> and
the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-things-busy-parents-should-know-about-the-parents-gateway-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parents Gateway mobile app</a> for
young parents. Whether you need to apply for the Baby Bonus or fill in
a consent form for school activities, these apps have got you covered!</p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="SGTS" src="/images/technews/8-tech-terms-to-impress-your-relatives-with-this-lunar-new-year-part7.png">
</div>
<h3>Government Technology Stack (新加坡政府科技堆栈 Xīnjiāpō zhèngfǔ kējì duīzhàn)</h3>
<p>From spring cleaning to whipping up a feast, a lot of work goes on behind
the scenes when preparing for Lunar New Year celebrations. The same goes
for creating family-centric apps and government digital services. In fact,
a whole new digital infrastructure—the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/singapore-government-tech-stack/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS)</a> —has
been built by GovTech. Think of SGTS as a factory line where many different
parts can be mixed and matched to assemble a variety of products and instructions
for assembly are freely shared among authorised personnel. This optimised
workflow allows more and better government digital services to be delivered
to citizens in a shorter time.</p>

</div>
<h3>Smart Lamp Posts (智能街灯 Zhìnéng jiēdēng)</h3>
<p>When celebrations drag on into the wee hours of the morning, you’ll be
grateful for Singapore’s brightly lit streets as you make your way home.
Soon, the lamp posts along the roads could be doing much more than provide
illumination. GovTech has been working on <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/infographics-just-how-smart-can-lamp-posts-get" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">smart lamp posts</a> that
can record things like traffic conditions, footfall, temperature and humidity
using a variety of cameras, sensors and Internet of Things devices. These
lamp posts will form the backbone of the Smart Nation Sensor Platform,
helping the Singapore government to gather urban and environmental data
so as to better plan our cityscape.</p>
<p>So there you have it, eight tech terms to share with your relatives and
friends this lunar new year. If nothing else, these talking points could
help divert the conversation away from those awkward questions about your
grades or relationship status. Gong xi fa cai!</p>
