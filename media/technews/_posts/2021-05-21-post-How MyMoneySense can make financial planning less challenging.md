</p>
<p>If you find financial planning painful, you can take some comfort in the
fact that you aren‚Äôt alone.</p>
<p>Way back in 2017, the Financial Planning Attitudes Survey was conducted
to understand Singapore Residents‚Äô financial behaviours and attitudes towards
financial planning.</p>
<p>From what was gleaned from the 2,800 responses, only 3 in 5 Singapore
residents have started planning for future financial needs.</p>
<p>Common reasons cited for not planning were ‚Äònot having enough money to
start financial planning‚Äô, ‚Äòthinking it was too early to start‚Äô and ‚Äònot
knowing where or how to start‚Äô.</p>
<p>Mind you, this was pre-pandemic. With Singapore facing its toughest challenge
since independence, last year was the year when people were forced to take
a hard look at their finances.</p>
<p>That said, four years ago, the wheels had already been in motion to help
galvanise Singaporeans into starting financial planning.</p>
<h3>Enter MyMoneySense, a digital financial planning solution</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mymoneysense.gov.sg/?&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=publicagenciesEDM&amp;utm_campaign=MyMoneySenseCampaign2021" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyMoneySense</a>&nbsp;is
a free government financial planning service that helps Singaporeans better
understand their finances so they can make conscious choices to improve
their financial well-being across different life stages.</p>
<p>By providing neutral, personalised, and actionable guidance, MyMoneySense
helps lower the barriers to entry for financial planning and helps Singaporeans
get started.</p>
<p>It does this in three ways.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Consolidate.</strong>&nbsp;MyMoneySense leverages SGFinDex, a
digital infrastructure that enables you to easily access your financial
data across various government agencies and banks (for now) and receive
a consolidated view of your finances.
<br>
<br>The biggest value-add? It‚Äôs that you get to see your overall cashflow
and net worth. This makes it easier for you to kickstart your financial
planning and make better financial decisions.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn.</strong>&nbsp;In addition, MyMoneySense also allows you
to learn more about your finances by using objective indicators and providing
personalised recommendations to improve your financial health.
<br>
<br>For example, one indicator is an emergency fund ratio, so that you know
how long you can sustain your expenses in the event of a loss of income.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan.</strong>&nbsp;Saving for a goal 5, 10 or 20 years ahead
can be daunting. MyMoneySense helps you work out the savings amount you
need to stay on track and reach your goals confidently.

<h3>A joint effort by private and public sectors</h3>
<p>Leon Poh, 29, a Senior Business Analyst from the Ministry of Manpower
(MOM), shared about working with other government agencies and the private
sector to help citizens with financial planning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFinancial information used to be very fragmented across different entities.
Putting together one‚Äôs finances can be quite tedious, and some people find
it hard to make sense of all the information.‚Äù</p>
<p>To help individuals with this, MOM participated in the world‚Äôs first public-private
partnership to build a public digital infrastructure, SGFinDex, to enable
data consolidation across various government agencies and financial institutions.
As there are many data fields that could be consolidated, MOM and other
SGFinDex participants collaborated to identify the key ones that are essential
for financial planning to help individuals, especially those who are just
starting to plan easily.</p>
<p>Beyond mere consolidation of financial data, the team wanted to maximise
the value MyMoneySense can offer to users who retrieve data onto the service.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot more that MyMoneySense can offer with SGFinDex. We could
provide useful data visualisations, financial health assessment and personalised
recommendations to help users improve their financial health.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was achieved by engaging MAS and the Institute for Financial Literacy
(IFL) to develop the business rules and curate the financial health indicators.
Several usability tests were also conducted to incorporate user feedback
before implementation.</p>
<h3>An engineering perspective</h3>
<p>Sng Han Jie, 28, an Associate Software Engineer from GovTech, also shared
his experiences working on the project.</p>
<p>One of the challenges he faced was the long lead time before the SGFinDex
platform would be ready.</p>
<p>This led the team to rethink how they could design the application in
a way that still provided some value to users before the central platform
was ready. A beta version that encouraged users to save actively was released
in 2019 using manual data entry by users. Through the beta version, the
team was able to get user feedback and incorporate the learnings into the
official launch.</p>
<p>Another challenge was in the consolidation of data through SGFinDex.</p>
<p>Sng says, ‚ÄúAs we were the first users of the platform and the only service
consumer to use OIDC(OpenID Connect) for authentication, there were many
teething data issues that we had to solve along the way throughout all
stages of the project (UAT, pilot, production).</p>
<p>These issues included misalignments amongst banks regarding error formats,
receiving data with missing fields, and also receiving duplicated data.‚Äù
We worked closely with all parties on the project to resolve the issues
and the infrastructure is now more robust.</p>
<h3>A true ‚Äòagile‚Äô project</h3>
<p>In tech, we talk a lot about the ‚Äòagile‚Äô mindset, which puts a heavy focus
on collaboration, improvement and learning cycles, pride in ownership,
focus on delivering value, and the ability to adapt to change.</p>
<p>In many ways, the MyMoneySense project was an exemplification of those
values.</p>
<p>The team collaborated closely with various stakeholders and adapted quickly
to unforeseen circumstances to deliver multiple incremental improvements
over the past two years.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they managed to deliver a product that will continue to provide
real value by making financial planning far more accessible.</p>
