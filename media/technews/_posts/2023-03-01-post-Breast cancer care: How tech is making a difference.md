<p>Did you know that breast cancer is the most common cancer among Singaporean
women? Each year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singaporecancersociety.org.sg/learn-about-cancer/types-of-cancer/breast-cancer.html#overview" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">over 2,000 women</a>&nbsp;here
are diagnosed with the disease and die from it.</p>
<p>As we mark International Women‚Äôs Day on March 8, we shine a spotlight
on how technology is changing breast cancer care and the way patients can
access information on the disease. After all, early detection and treatment
can save lives, and the knowledge here may make a difference to those around
you.</p>
<h3>AI chatbot service</h3>
<p>Women at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) can get information
about the disease through an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nuhs.edu.sg/sites/nuhs/NUHS%20Assets/News%20Documents/NUHS%20Corp/Media%20Releases/2021/Media-Release-NCIS-BotMD-Meet-Angie-that-empowers-women-at-risk-of-hereditary-breast-cancer.pdf" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AI chatbot</a>&nbsp;while
also learning about how genetic testing can help.</p>
<p>They can also fill in their family medical history using the Whatsapp
service for risk assessment. This is done before going for a genetic counselling
session to understand the pros and cons of genetic testing and discuss
their options with an expert.</p>
<p>Without the WhatsApp chatbot, a counsellor has to contact the patient
by phone to gather the family medical history in a call that can take up
to an hour.</p>
<p>The initial counselling session can also be a case of information overload
mixed with anxiety over possibly having to grapple with a serious disease.
Hence, patients are often unable to make a decision on whether to undergo
testing.</p>
<p>By using the chatbot known as Angie, patients skip the phone call and
complete their family medical history at their own convenience. They also
get bite-sized modules of information that they don‚Äôt have to finish in
one sitting. After a module is completed, the chatbot will send patients
more information, such as videos and infographics about HOBC, cancer genetic
testing, and the counselling process. Angie can also answer frequently
asked questions on topics like screening and risk-reducing strategies,
as well as the cost of genetic testing.</p>
<h3>Treatment cost calculator</h3>
<p>Besides fighting the disease, cancer patients also have the added stress
of uncertainty over treatment costs. A digital calculator aims to help
give patients better estimates of their monthly out-of-pocket costs, giving
them a better grasp of their financial situation.</p>
<p>The calculator, known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/calculator-cancer-chemotherapy-treatment-cost-subsidies-patients-ncis-botmd-2888921" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ChemoCalc</a>,
takes into account various data points such as the patient‚Äôs residency
status, means-testing tier, and eligibility for government subsidies. It
also takes in personal information, such as the treatment regime the patient
is on.</p>
<p>ChemoCalc then estimates the patient‚Äôs out-of-pocket monthly expenditure
and a list of the medication and treatment services. This facilitates the
easy submission of claims, and the document can be printed for patients.</p>
<h3>Telemedicine for palliative care</h3>
<p>The National Cancer Centre Singapore runs a 12-week palliative care programme
through video and phone consultation for advanced stage 3 and 4 cancer
patients. Known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nccs.com.sg/patient-care/Pages/bringing-cancer-care-to-the-home.aspx" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Telemedicine Clinic</a>,
it starts with a video consultation with a doctor and a nurse. Family members
and caregivers often join this first consultation, which builds trust and
rapport with the patient‚Äôs support system.</p>
<p>The patients then complete a questionnaire, which will be conducted weekly,
to report physical and psychosocial symptoms.</p>
<p>Using the information from the completed questionnaire, the care team
follows up with a phone call to determine if changes are needed to their
clinical management plan.</p>
<p>Shifting some of the caregiving procedures to video and phone consultation
has enabled faster treatment adjustments and reduced waiting time at the
cancer centre‚Äôs premises.</p>
<h3>AI-powered mammogram</h3>
<p>An AI startup known as FathomX is developing technology for more accurate
and faster detection of breast cancer through mammograms.</p>
<p>FxMammo, an AI-powered mammography support tool, has shown good promise
so far in accurately detecting cancer in dense breasts among Asian women.
Tests have also shown a reduction in false positives for cancers diagnosed
in between routine screening. The tool has also been found to reduce screening
time and manpower needs.</p>
<p>The startup, which is a spin-off from the National University of Singapore
and the National University Health System, raised over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/asia/singaporean-startup-fathomx-scores-almost-2m-hasten-breast-cancer-ai-development" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">$2 million</a>&nbsp;in
September 2022 to continue developing the tool.</p>
<h3>Continual fight against the disease</h3>
<p>According to the Singapore Cancer Society, there is a 5% chance of a woman
in Singapore developing breast cancer in her lifetime. Those with a family
history of breast cancer face twice the risk.</p>
<p>Given the relatively widespread nature of this disease, it is all the
more important that progress is continually made in its detection and treatment.</p>
<h4>The good news is that tech is ever-improving and making a difference in the battle against breast cancer. Together with good protocols for regular screening, hopefully, we can one day turn the tide and bring down the prevalence of breast cancer.</h4>
