<p>On the surface, mosquitoes and big data might seem like two totally unrelated
topics.</p>
<p>One of them is primitive, with origins dating back to at least the Jurassic
period. The other is a marvel of the 21st century; made possible only by
recent advancements in human technology. Ancient vs cutting edge, nature
vs nurture. Almost impossible to reconcile.</p>
<p>But thatâ€™s exactly what NEAâ€™s Gravitrap project is doing â€“ using data
on mosquitoes to fight dengue</p>
<p>With that in mind, we approached Goh Jie Wei, Data Analyst from NEA to
shed more light on the project. Hereâ€™s what he had to say.</p>

being used to fight dengue!</p>
<h2>What and how does a Gravitrap work?</h2>
<p>The Gravitrap is designed to attract and trap gravid female Aedes mosquitoes
â€“ gravid here means egg-carrying, or if you prefer a human term â€“ pregnant.</p>
<p>Anyway, when these mosquitoes try to lay eggs in a Gravitrap, the sticky
lining traps them, ensuring they canâ€™t leave the trap. At the same time,
due to the design, the Gravitrap prevents emergence of any mosquitoes from
eggs that are laid in the trap. Hereâ€™s a fun fact: many people are concerned
that more mosquitoes will bite them because of Gravitraps. Truth is, you've
got nothing to fear: Female mosquitoes typically feed on blood, but only
when they are looking to produce eggs.</p>
<p>Gravid female Aedes mosquitoes have already produced these eggs, so they
will not bite people!</p>
<h2>Where are the Gravitraps?</h2>
<p>In January 2020, NEA completed the Gravitrap deployment in private landed
estates, complementing those already deployed at HDB estates since 2017.</p>
<p>Before that, Gravitraps were mainly deployed along the common corridors
or staircases of HDB residential blocks. We now have more than 64,000 Gravitraps
deployed island-wide to monitor the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in
Singapore.</p>

<p>Read on to find out how Wei Jie from NEA uses data to fight dengue!</p>
<h2>How does Gravitrap fit into NEAâ€™s bigger efforts?</h2>
<p>Gravitraps, when distributed across an area, allow NEA to monitor the
Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the vicinity. NEA checks and maintains
the Gravitraps fortnightly to ensure that they are functioning properly
â€“ and trapped mosquitoes are actually collected and identified up to the
species level.</p>
<p>Information such as the number of mosquitoes trapped, species of mosquitoes,
location and functional status of the Gravitraps are collated for further
analyses, and later used to guide NEAâ€™s vector control efforts.</p>
<p>That way, NEA can prioritise its resources, with greater precision at
areas with higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population to search and destroy
the breeding habitats that could be sustaining the populations!</p>
<p><em>Public Service Announcement: Misplace or toppled Gravitraps disrupt NEAâ€™s island-wide Gravitrap surveillance network and could lead to gaps in our intelligence at the localised level! So, please do not remove or tamper with the Gravitraps â€“ they are definitely not ashtrays!</em>
</p>
<h2>What does NEA do with all the data it collects?</h2>
<p>NEA develops trends and assessments on the mosquito population at the
national and localised levels. This is then used to optimise its resources
to areas with high Aedes aegypti mosquito population; a shift towards risk-based
approach for effective use of resources.</p>
<p>The processed data also informs NEAâ€™s targeted approach to public communications
(via mainstream media and also shared monthly through the myENV app and
NEAâ€™s website) to increase awareness among stakeholders and the community
of the risk of dengue and take proactive mosquito prevention measures.</p>
<p>Through the myENV app, members of the public who have subscribed to the
alerts are notified if they are staying within areas of high Aedes aegypti
mosquito population and will be urged to carry out their own checks in
their homes.</p>
<p>NEA also provides Gravitrap surveillance data to Town Councils (TCs) and
other relevant stakeholders to help prioritise their mosquito prevention
and control measures at areas with higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population.</p>
<p>Such information is also shared with key stakeholders such as IADTF(interagency
dengue task force) members to enable them to take timely action to mitigate
transmission.</p>
<h2>What advice do you have for those of us living in dengue prone areas?</h2>
<p>It depends on what zone you live in!</p>
<p>Residents residing in red and yellow dengue clusters should protect themselves
against dengue fever by spraying insecticide in dark corners of the house,
applying insect repellent regularly, and wearing long sleeve tops and long
pants.</p>
<p>They should also do the Mozzie Wipe-out steps frequently to remove stagnant
water from their homes and immediate surroundings to deprive the mosquitoes
of breeding habitats.</p>
