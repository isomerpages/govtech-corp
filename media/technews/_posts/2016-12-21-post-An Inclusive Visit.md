<p>“Is this really a Government office?” Minister Tan Chuan-Jin quipped as
he stepped into GovTech’s Hive office, home to the Government Digital Services
(GDS) team.</p>
<p>Mr Tan, Minister for Social and Family Development, dropped by Hive for
the first time on 24 November 2016, to meet two members of the GDS team.</p>
<p>It was his second stop that morning; the first being National University
Hospital (NUH), where he met two admin assistants from SG Enable’s School-to-Work
programme.</p>
<p>Minister Tan was keen to learn how NUH and GovTech accommodated the needs
of persons with disabilities, and especially how they could adapt and thrive
in their workplaces.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Government Chief Information Officer and GovTech Deputy
Chief Executive, Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Minister Tan first met 25-year-old
Mr Lim Zui Young, an engineer who is part of the GDS DevOps (or Development
Operations) team.</p>
<p>Hailing from the pioneer batch of interns at GDS, Zui Young came on board
full-time after graduating from SMU with a Masters of Applied Information
Systems.</p>
<p>Zui Young can only see with his right eye, and it is tough for him to
look at computer screens due to blurred vision and glare.</p>
<p>But despite his high astigmatism, Zui Young has no major issues at work,
thanks to some clever design hacks and workplace arrangements (such as
using bolder fonts on larger computer monitors).</p>
<p>Other useful tweaks which Zui Young demonstrated to the Minister included
switching to inverted colours cuts off screen glare and improves onscreen
contrast, helping him to see better.</p>
<p>Zui Young also showed how he used the on-screen magnifier and text-to-speech
engines to help him read long passages of information.</p>
<p>As a DevOps engineer, Zui Young has contributed greatly to projects like
the Business Grants Portal, a one-stop portal that lets businesses apply
for multiple Government grants through a simplified online form system.</p>
<p>Current intern William Tay, who is a Year 3 Infocomm Security Management
student at Singapore Polytechnic, also had the opportunity to chat with
the Minister.</p>
<p>William’s hearing disability was no hurdle for him to enjoy a conversation
with the Minister — both parties were able to chat using separate laptops.</p>
<p>William shared with the Minister his thoughts about working in Hive.</p>
<p>He said: “The office lets me interact with different people regardless
of their position. Our culture is really like a start-up. I use an app
that allows both parties to type big text on my mobile phone to manage
one-on-one communications. I am excited that I am now working with my colleague
Johnson to develop the speech to text app for those with similar disabilities."</p>
<p>William revealed that one of his colleagues even picked up sign language
in order to communicate better with him, adding: "I felt that was amazing!”</p>
<p>At the end of the visit, Minister Tan, through the experiences of both
Zui Young and William, saw for himself how both of them managed to thrive
at Hive.</p>
<p>He also had enough time to test drive the autonomous wheelchair prototype
and check out the new drones currently being tested by GDS' Emerging Tech
team, and also chat with several GovTechies.</p>
<p>Thank you for the visit, Minister!</p>
