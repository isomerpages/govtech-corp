<p>The barista hands you your afternoon pick-me-up and you reach over to
pay with a tap of your phone, no cash or credit card required.</p>
<p>Back in the office, an email comes through with good news—the small business
loan you applied for 48 hours ago has been approved, without any bankers
or brokers involved.</p>
<p>Later that night, your friend picks up the tab for dinner and you transfer
her your share via an app, without needing to rummage through your purse
for change.</p>
<p>It’s all in a day’s work—made easier with the help of fintech.</p>
<p>Financial technology, as fintech is more formally known, refers to the
broad array of financial products and services that employ the innovative
use of technology. Fintech firms have made it easier for people to transfer
funds, make payments, manage their wealth, seek investment advice and even
obtain loans.</p>
<p>In 2015, fintech firms — with hubs in London, New York, Tel Aviv, Hong
Kong, Sydney and Singapore, among others — attracted US$22.3 billion from
investors around the world, and this figure is <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/financial-services/fintech-survey/report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">expected to exceed US$150 billion</a> in
the next three to five years.</p>
<p>Here are five things you need to know about the booming fintech industry.</p>
<h3>Goodbye, middleman?</h3>
<p>Fintech’s most powerful weapon, according to professional services firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers, is disintermediation. “While financial service
organisations have acted as intermediaries in the financial system by providing
an invaluable service to clients, their functions are being usurped by
new technology-driven business models,” PwC reported last year.</p>
<p>Fintech is making the middleman obsolete.</p>
<p>For example, individuals seeking investment advice no longer need to make
an appointment with a bank’s financial advisor; automated robo-advisors
such as WiseBanyan and Betterment can do the job. People and businesses
no longer need to queue at the bank for loans and be subjected to stringent
lending criteria; they can turn to marketplace lenders like China’s CreditEase
for peer-to-peer lending.</p>
<p>“It’s a true disruption,” Richard Koh, co-founder of M-DAQ, a company
that facilitates multi-currency trading across borders, told TechNews.</p>
<p>“Things you previously had to go to the bank or a broker for, you can
now potentially bypass. Fintech is literally replacing an incumbent in
the value chain.”</p>
<h3>Shake it up, banks</h3>
<p>“Fintech” may seem like a buzzword that appeared in the past two to three
years, but the industry’s beginnings can actually be traced back to 2008.
The credit crisis that year resulted in financial services facing heavy
regulation around risk control, said Credit Suisse strategist Falguni Desai
in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/falgunidesai/2015/12/14/the-fintech-revolution/#6afb59d0249d" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recent Forbes article</a>.</p>
<p>The outcome: “a perfect vacuum of innovation in banks.”</p>
<p>When fintech firms first appeared on the scene to fill this void, banks
and other financial institutions didn’t take them seriously, said Daniel
Liebau, who founded <a href="https://www.lightbulbcap.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lightbulb Capital</a> to help companies
improve their performances by providing them with benchmark data and insights.</p>
<p>“The reaction was that these are just small technology companies, so our
business is quite safe,” he told TechNews.“But more recently even very
prominent banks like JP Morgan acknowledge that these firms are ‘trying
to eat our lunch.’”</p>
<p>Banks today, aware of the threat posed by fintech firms, have tried to
shed their traditional stuffy image and appear more innovative.</p>
<p>“Every bank these days has decided they need to embrace the culture,”
said M-DAQ’s Koh. “Every bank has an in-house fintech unit — laboratory,
incubator, or simply events halls with beer and pizza.”</p>
<h3>It’s not all disruptive</h3>
<p>But fintech firms don’t just exist to wreak havoc on traditional banks,
insurers and large financial institutions. It’s true that some companies
are ‘disruptors’ that use technology to take away business from established
financial service firms, said Lightbulb Capital’s Liebau.</p>
<p>“But most companies are actually ‘enablers’ who have moved into providing
services and products to sell to large financial institutions,” Liebau
added. These firms partner with established companies to help acquire new
customers (Australia’s Avoka), reduce fraud (Swiss-based NetGuardians),
provide multi-currency payment solutions (Bankable in the UK), among other
services.</p>
<h3>Democratising finance</h3>
<p>Fintech is said to bring about many benefits, and one of the most commonly
cited is that it’s helping to tackle financial exclusion. Fintech firms
have levelled the financial playing field, bringing banking services—once
restricted to established companies and high or moderate net-worth individuals
— to small businesses and the poor.</p>
<p>“Customers who fall below the threshold, the underbanked and unbanked
mostly in developing economies, SMEs who need microloans — these are the
ones that fintech could help,” said M-DAQ’s Koh.</p>
<p>For example, bKash has brought mobile banking services to Bengalis living
in rural areas — seven in every ten people in the South Asian region —
enabling them to send and receive money, make payments and top up their
phone credits through their mobile phones.</p>
<h3>Power to the people</h3>
<p>Although fintech signals increased competition, the good news is that
this often translates into more efficient products and services.</p>
<p>“Just like how Uber and Grab lowered taxi fares, and a fourth telco in
Singapore helped reduce prices, fintech will lead to ultimate gains for
the end customer,” said Raghav Kapoor, co-founder of Singapore-based
<a href="https://www.smartkarma.com/home/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SmartKarma</a>, a firm that provides clients with investment insight.</p>
<p>“That’s actually excellent for consumption.”</p>
<p>With fintech competition set to heat up in the coming years, customers
can look forward to more products and services that will make their financial
dealings smoother, faster and more convenient.</p>
