<p>“You’ve got an Angbao” the app notification flashed on my nephew’s mobile.</p>
<p>“Thanks uncle, Gong Xi Fa Cai!“ he beamed excitedly and raced to his parents
to show off his first digital red packet. As I watched my young nephew’s
excitement, I instantly thought of how digitalising the traditional custom
of red packet-giving is one of the sparks propelling the e-payment juggernaut
across Asia.</p>
<p>Prime example in this space is WeChat Red Packet which originally began
as an experiment for Tencent employees to exchange red packets during the
Chinese New Year. Since its 2014 launch, it has seen hyper-adoption rates
with a reported 768 million users sending digital red packets via WeChat
over the recent 2018 festive season. E-payment services like WeChat Pay
and Alibaba’s AliPay have become ubiquitous in cities and towns across
China. Millions use them daily for peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and transactions
for nearly everything from entertainment, food, healthcare, transport and
utility services.</p>
<p>Here in Singapore, we too enjoy a wide range of e-payment services operated
by various providers such as Apple, EZ-Link, DBS Bank, Grab, NETS, Samsung
and SingTel. Going digital and cashless is not a new or novel experience
for the residents of our island nation.</p>
<p>In fact, more 30 years ago, Singapore pioneered one of the world’s first
nationwide e-payment services in 1986 when NETS (Network for Electronic
Transfer Singapore) launched NETS Debit enabling bank ATM cardholders to
pay electronically for their bills and retail purchases. This was followed
by other payment innovations such as NETS Cashcard - a pioneering form
of stored digital cash for making small value e-payments such as carpark
and ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) charges.</p>
<p>Over the decades, NETS acceptance points have grown to well over 100,000
throughout Singapore and in 2016, the total value of NETS transactions
reached SGD24 billion.</p>
<p>Being early e-payment adopters, many in Singapore have already experienced
the convenience of going cashless and are ready to welcome new payment
services powered by app-based technologies.</p>
<p>As a vibrant Asian fintech hub, there has been no shortage of such innovative
payment solutions debuting in Singapore. Over the last 4 years, we have
seen a steady stream of mobile payment apps from major financial institutions
(e.g. DBS PayLah! and OCBC Pay Anyone), global phone makers (e.g. Apple
Pay and Samsung Pay), regional telecommunication operators and even ride-hailing
providers (e.g SingTel Dash and GrabPay).</p>
<p>Many of such apps started as mobile e-wallets for credit and debit cards
but have rapidly moved into P2P fund transfers. For example, the Singapore
headquartered ride-hailing service provider, Grab introduced P2P functionality
on its in-app mobile wallet GrabPay in 2017 and has been especially active
in promoting its use amongst small businesses such as hawkers.</p>
<p>This is a laudable move since hawkers constitute a sizable group of traditionally
cash-only business operators who have until now, been deterred by the costs
and fees normally associated with point-of-sale systems. With mobile payment
apps such as DBS PayLah! and GrabPay, an expanding number of hawkers and
small businesses, together with their mobile carrying customers, are making
the quick and easy switch to e-payments. Thanks to the multiple functionalities
available on these apps, users can not only check their bank accounts,
perform financial transactions or hail rides, but also pay for their food,
entertainment and other retail purchases.</p>
<p>To help even more people enjoy the benefits of the digital economy, the
government has also been taking steps to further advance and facilitate
Singapore’s move towards a cash-free society. A significant milestone is
the launch of the PayNow fund transfer service in July 2017. Supported
by the Association of Banks of Singapore, PayNow allows for instantaneous
fund transfers just by using the recipient’s mobile number or identity
card number. With PayNow, users no longer need to remember or share bank
account details in order to send or receive funds thereby removing a major
user bugbear hindering electronic fund transfers.</p>
<p>In the months following PayNow’s launch, more than a million users have
registered for PayNow and used it mostly for P2P transfers totalling in
excess of SGD370 million. During the recent 2018 Budget debates, it was
announced that PayNow Corporate will be launched to enable businesses to
link their corporate bank accounts to their unique entity numbers (UENs)
and that public agencies will also begin to use PayNow (e.g. Central Provident
Fund Board will allow eligible members aged over 55 years of age to receive
lump sum withdrawals via PayNow).</p>
<p>Adding to this positive momentum generated by PayNow, users in Singapore
can also look forward to SGQR in 2018. Conceived as a national QR code
standard, SGQR will facilitate QR code-based payments via a common standard
across an entire range of e-payment services. By enabling seamless e-payments
for all customers and merchants, PayNow and SGQR constitute a powerful
complementary combination which will further accelerate Singapore’s digital
transition towards a cashless society.</p>
<p>In addition to making e-payments convenient and fast, Singapore is also
moving to enhance its payments regulatory framework which has as its key
existing pillars - the Money-Changing and Remittance Businesses Act (MCRBA)
and the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act (PSOA).</p>
<p>In a recent public consultation paper, the Monetary Authority of Singapore
released details on a new Payment Services Bill (PS Bill). This proposed
legislation will consolidate current MCRBA and PSOA rules as well as expand
the scope of regulated activities in order to govern both traditional and
new payment services. Under the draft First Schedule of the PS Bill, regulated
activities would be classified into the following seven categories –</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>providing account issuance services,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing domestic money transfer services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing cross border money transfer services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing merchant acquisition services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing money-changing services,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing virtual currency services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e-money issuance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, e-wallets and payment apps which allow users to make payments
from bank accounts or credit cards would potentially fall under the regulated
category of account issuance services.</p>
<p>When enacted, the PS Bill will enhance MAS’ ability to implement appropriate
user protection measures in a broad range of payment services. In turn,
such measures would provide users even more assurance and confidence in
their use of e-payment services. Viewed together with PayNow, SGQR and
other market-led innovations, an expanded regulatory framework for payments
is timely and would be much welcomed.</p>
<p>With the expected double-digit growth rates in e-payment activities across
Asia in the coming decade, Singapore’s continued efforts to develop an
accessible, efficient and interoperable payments ecosystem serve as shining
guideposts in the journey towards building a Smart Nation.</p>
