<p>Fancy yourself a cybersecurity warrior? Then, you’ll have lots to get
excited about in the final months of 2022 as GovTech’s cybersecurity competition
returns!</p>
<p>STACK the Flags – which attracted over 1,400 participants in 2020 – is
back, and GovTech will also be organising STACK the Codes, the first-ever
cybersecurity hackathon by the government where the best teams not only
stand to win cash prizes but also the chance to build fully functional
proofs of concept under the mentorship of GovTech’s Cyber Security Group!</p>

<h3>What can you expect at STACK the Codes?</h3>
<p>While traditional hackathons usually take place over one to two days,
STACK the Codes gives competitors 30 days to ideate and develop Minimum
Viable Products, or MVPs. Comprising two rounds in October and November,
teams will gain unique insights into cybersecurity threats the public sector
faces and develop novel solutions in areas such as Red Teaming, Blue Teaming,
Policy Planning, and Operations. The event aims to uncover potential talent
that can help bolster the public sector’s cybersecurity workforce.</p>
<h3>What’s new about STACK the Flags 2022?</h3>
<p>Fans of Capture-the-Flag competitions should look out for STACK the Flags
2022. It will commence in December after the conclusion of STACK the Codes,
and participants will get to showcase their “offensive” cybersecurity skills
across 11 cybersecurity domains. Teams that can capture the most flags
after 48 hours will emerge as the victors.</p>
<p>Calvin Fong and Sean Seah, who finished among the top five teams in the
Open and JC &amp; ITE categories respectively at STACK the Flags 2020,
shared that they found the puzzles challenging and engaging. They also
commended the competition for its fast, responsive support and stable infrastructure
that enabled participants to fully enjoy the experience.</p>
<p>In 2022, the organising team seeks to enhance competitors’ experience
by not only increasing the level of difficulty, but to also create challenges
that are more technically interesting.</p>

<h3>Show me the money!</h3>
<p>No competition is complete without the allure of the prizes. STACK the
Codes and STACK the Flags offer cash prizes of over SGD $90,000 to the
best teams.</p>
<p>What’s more, there is an added incentive for participants of STACK the
Codes: teams can earn a six-month mentorship with GovTech’s Cyber Security
Group to build prototypes for cybersecurity programmes. As most hackathons
lack follow-up, many great ideas are neglected after the competition concludes.
GovTech hopes to avoid this by ensuring that it continues to engage winning
teams to create a workable solution.</p>
<p>This presents the perfect opportunity for professionals and enthusiasts
alike to work with real-world experts on a real-world problem.</p>
<h3>Best of both worlds!</h3>
<p>By introducing these two competitions, Jaga the STACK will not just test
“offensive” skills but also solution development.</p>
<p>Sean is looking forward to this year’s edition. Beyond the prize money,
he believes the “gamified” framework adds fun to learning new concepts.
With just six months of experience in other competitions under his belt
before joining STACK the Flags 2020, he said the event was “life-changing”
as it convinced him to continue pursuing cyber security.</p>
<p>Calvin and his team also had a great time and strongly encouraged his
friends to take part this year. “The competition is a good chance for them
to showcase skills they’ve learnt in and out of school. The challenges
were rewarding, and this would be a good chance for students like us to
gain more exposure in the field.”</p>
