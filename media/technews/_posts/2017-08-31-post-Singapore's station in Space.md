<p>“Space, the final frontier.”</p>
<p>These were the words made famous by William Shatner aka Captain James
Kirk in the original Star Trek television series.</p>
<p>Growing up watching these fantastical depictions of space travel, many
of us may have wondered what it would be like to breach the atmosphere
in a rocket, shrug off the tug of gravity and look down at Earth from a
celestial vantage point.</p>
<p>One of a select few to have experienced this is US National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) Commander Jeffrey Williams.</p>
<p>Mr Williams, who played a significant role in the construction of the
International Space Station (ISS), once held the record (since broken in
April 2017 by Dr Peggy Whitson) for spending more time in space than any
other US astronauts — an impressive 534 days!</p>
<p>While small countries like Singapore may not have their own rocket launchpads
or space programmes, that doesn’t mean that they are left out of the great
human adventure into space, Mr Williams told TechNews in an interview.</p>
<p>He held a meet-and-greet session on 2 August 2017 at the Nanyang Technological
University (NTU).</p>
<p>In today’s globalised world, technology and talent transfer are not limited
by geographical boundaries, meaning that even the smallest of nations can
nurture big ambitions for space exploration, said Commander Williams.</p>
<p>Here are three takeaways from a chat with him:</p>
<h3>Singapore's role in space</h3>
<p>Although the original space race had its roots in hostile competition,
recent exploits into the void have been congenial and collaborative.</p>
<p>This is best represented by the ISS, which hosts astronauts from the US,
Canada, Europe, Japan and Russia.</p>
<p>“Space programmes are sustained by political will, and a lot of the time,
political will is solidified in international partnerships,” Mr Williams
told TechNews.</p>
<p>“Hence, even smaller countries like Singapore have a tremendous opportunity
to join partnerships to contribute, participate and reap the benefits of
exploration.”</p>
<p>Indeed, a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/7th-ntu-satellite-marks-a-spore-first" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore satellite</a> jointly
developed by NTU and Japan’s Kyushu Institute of Technology was launched
from the ISS on 17 January 2017.</p>
<p>The Aoba Velox-III was designed to test the durability of commercial microprocessors
in low Earth orbit and consists of a micro-propulsion system and a wireless
communication system, weighing approximately two kilogrammes in total.</p>
<p>Although such projects may be small in scale at present, the knowledge
gleaned from them could pave the way for bigger and better Singapore-made
satellites in the future.</p>
<h3>Fund the future</h3>
<p>Space exploration is an expensive endeavour, requiring a significant amount
of research and development.</p>
<p>This means that most private businesses, whether in Singapore or around
the world, are unlikely to be able to bear the cost on their own.</p>
<p>“Space exploration takes a lot of resources, so usually governments have
to pick up the tab to drive innovations for that purpose,” said Mr Williams.</p>
<p>However, he noted that by providing the seed funding for research and
development in space technology, governments can create economic models
that favour commercial entities and startups getting into the early space
business.</p>
<p>Public-private partnerships could also help defray the risks of investing
in space technology and provide a longer runway for such projects to take
off.</p>
<p>Citing the example of the aviation industry, Mr Williams elaborated on
how initial investments into promising technological capabilities could
lead to massive payoffs in the future.</p>
<p>“Governments invested heavily in aviation engineering, and the technologies
were eventually cost-effective enough to be picked up by the commercial
world. Today, we know that aviation is a huge industry supported by a strong
and sustainable economic model,” said Mr Williams.</p>
<p>“If history repeats itself — and it usually does — we might expect to
see the same thing happen with space technology and space exploration.”</p>
<h3>Launch the heartware</h3>
<p>Simply browsing through NASA’s recruitment page gives you an idea of the
qualifications needed to work in space exploration.</p>
<p>The minimal requirement is a bachelor’s degree, although most NASA employees
usually have a higher education certificate to their names.</p>
<p>“Most of the non-military astronauts have PhDs or are medical doctors.
Most of us who are from a military background have at least master’s degrees
in various scientific disciplines. So, it takes high levels of education
to be competitive,” said Mr Williams.</p>
<p>This is good news for Singapore, with its highly educated workforce and
reputation throughout the world as a hub for quality higher education.</p>
<p>In addition to the hardware, Singapore can supply the human and intellectual
capital — the heartware — required for space exploration.</p>
<p>Take Dr Goh Eng Lim, vice president of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, for
example.</p>
<p>The Spaceborne computer he helped develop was launched from Cape Canaveral
in August 2017, and is considered the most powerful supercomputer to have
been delivered into space.</p>
<p>If there’s one discipline that could open the door to space travel, Mr
Williams is placing his bet on engineering. Singaporeans keen to follow
in Dr Goh’s footsteps might want to take Mr Williams’ advice to heart:
“Engineers are very important. I think everything that we too often take
for granted around us, such as our transportation systems and our communication
systems, are a result of engineering.”</p>
<p>And it appears that engineering, and not space, is the actual final frontier.</p>
<p>As Mr Williams summed it up: “Not everyone will get the opportunity to
be an astronaut, but engineering is still a very practical discipline where
you take knowledge and combine it with raw materials to create something
useful.”</p>
