<p>It’s a recurrent trope in spy movies—a skilled secret agent infiltrates
an organisation and gathers compromising data on its people and processes;
information that can be used as leverage. Far from being limited to works
of fiction, gathering publicly available online information is more common
in everyday life than you think.</p>
<p>For example, when companies seek to fill a position, their human resource
division runs background checks on potential candidates through job portals
or even social media pages.</p>
<p>Intelligence amassed from public and unclassified sources and analysed
for a specific purpose—be it national security or corporate profiling—is
known as Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). Such information can be used
for good or malicious intent and a key step to protecting yourself is by
using OSINT tools to enhance your <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/our-capabilities/cybersecurity/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>cybersecurity solutions</u></a>.</p>
<p>If you are a(n):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organisation or business concerned about the security of your data?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT professional or cybersecurity expert looking to assess and mitigate
online security threats?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General individual who wants to check if their personal information has
been exposed online?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government entity involved in national security?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a quick download of OSINT 101, with tips on how to identify and
protect against data leaks.</p>
<h3>Understanding the risks of data leaks</h3>
<p>Data leaks are a growing concern in Singapore and globally. For businesses,
the risks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial loss: </strong>Companies may face direct financial damages,
including fraud, theft, or ransom payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reputational damage: </strong>A breach can severely damage customer
trust, leading to lost business and long-term brand harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory fines and legal action: </strong>Non-compliance with
data protection laws (like Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA))
can result in heavy penalties and lawsuits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operational disruption: </strong>Breaches can halt operations,
compromise internal systems, and require costly incident response efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loss of Intellectual Property: </strong>Confidential business
strategies, designs, or trade secrets may be exposed, giving competitors
an unfair advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customer Churn: </strong>Users may leave the platform or stop
using services due to fear of their personal data being compromised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals also face risks such as identity theft, financial fraud, and
reputational damage, while government entities should be concerned that
leaks of sensitive information could potentially endanger citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to prevent data leaks?</h3>
<h4>Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)</h4>
<p>OSINT is the practice of collecting and analysing publicly available information
related to an organisation that could be used by attackers. OSINT tools
help identify vulnerabilities which inform the next steps you can take
to enhance cybersecurity and enforce <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/ict-and-infrastructure/data-loss-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>data leakage protection</u></a>.</p>
<h3>What are OSINT tools?</h3>
<p>OSINT tools use a variety of techniques to gather and analyse publicly
available data. Here's a general overview of how OSINT works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Collection: </strong>OSINT tools crawl and collate publicly available
information from sources as varied as social media platforms, government
reports, news articles, press releases, academic papers, and commercial
databases. This could be done manually or through automated programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Processing: </strong>Once the data is collected, the tool filters
out any duplicated, irrelevant, outdated, or inaccurate information. Data
may be reorganised depending on its relevance and importance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis: </strong>The processed information is analysed for any
salient trends, patterns, or relationships. Analysis technologies include
natural language processing and data visualisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dissemination: </strong>The filtered and analysed OSINT information
is disseminated to key decision-makers and personnel. This can take the
form of a report or alert, depending on the organisation’s protocol.</p>
<h4>Core functions of OSINT tools</h4>
<p>OSINT tools have several core functions, including:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Threat intelligence: </strong>Identifying potential cyber threats
and vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital footprinting: </strong>Mapping an organisation's online
presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brand monitoring: </strong>Tracking mentions of a brand or organisation
online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Background checks: </strong>Verifying information about individuals
or organisations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who uses OSINT tools?</h4>
<p>OSINT tools can be used for good or malicious intent. Cybercriminals may
use OSINT to find potential targets and vulnerabilities, for instance,
while ethical ‘white hat’ hackers use OSINT for penetration testing and
vulnerability assessments.</p>
<p>Businesses may use OSINT for market research, competitive analysis, and
brand monitoring, while government agencies may find it relevant to maintaining
national security and law enforcement.</p>
<h4>What are some key OSINT sources?</h4>
<p>Key OSINT sources include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Search engines (Google, Bing, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New media (blogs, personal websites, digital newsletters, online portfolios,
etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public records (government databases, company registries)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web scraping tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data analysis tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traditional media (magazines, newspapers, radio and TV broadcasts, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unclassified datasets or reports by governments or corporations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While traditional media remains one of the most accessible sources of
public information, new media has quickly developed into an OSINT treasure
trove. Not only is new media and social media accessible from anywhere,
it is also easily shared. This means it enters the collective consciousness
of the general populace more rapidly and in a more uncontrollable way.
Once something has gone viral online, it’s near impossible to scrub and
remove all traces of it from existence.</p>
<h4><strong>How do I perform OSINT?</strong></h4>
<p>Search engines and social media sites are perhaps the most straightforward
means of carrying out OSINT. Simply by keying in the name of an individual
or organisation, one can learn what the public knows about the said party.</p>
<h3>Signs that your information might be leaked</h3>
<p>Wondering if your own data has been leaked? Early signs of information
leakage can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unusual website activity: </strong>Unexpected traffic, spikes
in login attempts, or unexpected changes to website content could indicate
unauthorised access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publicly available private data: </strong>Sensitive information<strong> </strong>such
as employee credentials, internal documents, or customer data should never
be publicly accessible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mentions on</strong>  <strong>leaking websites or in data breach reports: </strong>Websites
that aggregate data breach information, as well as specialised data leak
checker services, can provide valuable insights on potential data breaches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unexpected financial transactions: Be aware of unexplained credit card statements or bank accounts</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changes in search engine results: Unexpected or negative results could indicate that sensitive information has been leaked and is being indexed by search engines</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why OSINT tools are crucial for data security</h4>
<p>OSINT plays several key functions in proactive cybersecurity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerability identification: </strong>By identifying vulnerabilities
before they are exploited, organisations can significantly reduce their
risk of data breaches. This includes identifying exposed credentials, misconfigured
servers, and outdated software. For example, by monitoring public code
repositories like GitHub, organisations can detect if developers have inadvertently
committed sensitive information to the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Threat intelligence gathering: </strong>Through monitoring hacker
forums, social media, and other online sources, organisations or law enforcement
agencies can gather information on potential security threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital footprint analysis: </strong>OSINT helps organisations
understand their digital footprint, which is the sum of all online information
about them. This can encompass uncovering leaked credentials of high-value
targets such as C-suite personnel as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reputation management: </strong>By monitoring online discussions
and mentions of their brand, organisations can identify and address negative
sentiment or misinformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supply chain security: </strong>Organisations can use OSINT to
assess the security posture of their suppliers and partners and avoid cascading
negative effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insider threat detection: </strong>By monitoring employee activity
on social media and other online platforms, organisations can detect signs
of disgruntlement or malicious intent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a comprehensive OSINT protocol in place could help plug such vulnerability
or loopholes before they are exploited by hostile groups. It’s also important
to maintain <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>scam prevention protocols</u></a> and
heighten awareness of <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/top-five-scams-in-singapore-and-how-to-protect-yourself/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>phishing scams in Singapore</u></a> to
help avoid data leakages.</p>
<h3>Best OSINT tools to find information leaks</h3>
<p>To go deeper, organisations can use advanced search engines like:</p>
<h4>Google Hacking Database – for finding exposed information</h4>
<p>The Google Hacking Database (GHD) is a repository of custom Google search
terms for files containing sensitive information such as usernames, vulnerable
servers, and even passwords, also known as ‘Google Dorks’. Attackers can
use this database to identify search strings that may uncover vulnerabilities
and sensitive information on affected websites.</p>
<p>For example, the following search string would produce a list of directories
within with directory listing enabled, and these files are publicly accessible:</p>
<p><strong>site: intitle: “index of”</strong>
</p>
<p>Hence, organisations may use GHD to check whether any of their sensitive
information is inadvertently exposed via these custom search strings.</p>
<h4>Wayback Machine – for recovering exposed data</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Wayback Machine</u></a> is
like a digital time capsule for the internet. It stores snapshots of websites
from different points in time. This can be useful for attackers looking
for older versions of a website that might contain vulnerabilities or exposed
data. For example, an older version of a company's website might have a
contact form that doesn't properly sanitise inputs, allowing for a potential
SQL injection attack.</p>
<p>Defensively, organisations may use Wayback Machine to ensure that no sensitive
data exists in legacy editions of its webpages.</p>
<h4>Sploitus – for identifying exploitable data</h4>
<p><a href="https://sploitus.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Sploitus</u></a> is
a search engine for publicly-available exploits for vulnerable software.
Think of it as a library of known weaknesses in different software programmes.
Attackers may use these exploits to launch attacks against organisational
assets. For example, if a company is running an outdated version of a web
server with a known vulnerability, Sploitus can help an attacker find the
code needed to exploit that vulnerability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organisations may use Sploitus to find out if exploits
for the specific software versions they are using are publicly available.
Organisations can then remediate these exploits to pre-empt a breach.</p>
<p>For example, if an organisation server is using Drupal 8.6.10 (a Content
Management System, or CMS), a search in Sploitus could reveal if a public
exploit exists to compromise the CMS.

<h4>HaveIBeenPwned – checking for compromised accounts</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Are you leaking information on the web? Use these tools to find out" src="/images/technews/are-you-leading-information-on-the-web-part2.png">
</div>
<p><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>HaveIBeenPwned</u></a> is
a search engine for compromised email addresses. It's like a "check engine"
light for your online accounts. Anyone can use it to check if their email
addresses have been hijacked for malicious purposes and identify which
breaches the email addresses were involved in. If an employee learns that
his or her email address has been compromised, they can be advised to change
their passwords or to enable 2-factor authentication.</p>

<h4>Case Study 1: Preventing data breaches in a corporate environment</h4>
<p>Mass data breaches in corporations and companies have, unfortunately,
become more prevalent recently as hackers and cyberterrorists hone their
data breaching abilities. However, some organisations have taken proactive
steps to plug such leaks and limit the damage done. In November 2024, University
of Toronto-based Citizen Lab identified <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/apple-users-urged-to-update-devices-to-prevent-breach-by-pegasus-spyware" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>vulnerabilities in Apple devices that allows the Pegasus spyware to be covertly installed</u></a>.
Incidents of Pegasus spyware infections were found in 45 countries including
Singapore and Apple cooperated immediately with Citizen Lab to launch an
investigation. Citizen Lab also urged Apple device owners to update their
devices or enable Lockdown Mode to protect against future infections.</p>
<h4>Case Study 2: OSINT in government and national security</h4>
<p>Government and national security agencies in Singapore use OSINT to protect
the nation by detecting potential leaks of classified or sensitive information.
In a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/intelligence-expert-defends-singapore-against-hidden-threats-mindef-scholarship-centre" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>profile in the Straits Times</u></a>,
an officer from the Digital and Intelligence Service’s (DIS) Counter Terrorism
and Intelligence Group (CTIG) describes sifting through OSINT on mainstream
and social media platforms to piece together ‘clues’ in anticipating non-traditional
threats. This helps in preemptive actions against espionage or cyberattacks,
securing digital assets.</p>
<h3>Protect your data with OSINT tools</h3>
<p>In our highly digital world, the risk of information leakage is a growing
concern for individuals, businesses, and government entities alike. By
understanding what open source intelligence is and leveraging the power
of OSINT techniques and tools, you can take proactive steps to safeguard
your valuable data.</p>
