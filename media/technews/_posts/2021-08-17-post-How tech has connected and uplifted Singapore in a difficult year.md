<p>No sugar coating it; the past year or so has been tough on everyone as
Singapore continues its fight against Covid-19. Front-line workers have
worked extra hard to keep the virus at bay. Businesses have felt the strain
on their bottom lines. And social and family ties have been tested by heightened
alert and safe distancing measures.</p>
<p>This year‚Äôs National Day Parade has even been postponed to Aug 21, with
a simpler observance ceremony on National Day itself.</p>
<p>Yet, in these trying times, we see the Singapore spirit shining through.
Fellow Singaporeans are uniting the community through tech-driven initiatives
‚Äì here are some of their stories!</p>

<h3>Supporting our hawkers</h3>
<p>Eateries have been relying on delivery services when dining-in was restricted.
But what about hawkers ‚Äì especially the ones not comfortable with English
and tech ‚Äì who faced difficulties offering their fare online?</p>

over 200 digitally disadvantaged hawkers and counting, with the aim of
boosting their business.</p>
<p>Those who want to support these hawkers can pull out the interactive Google
map, see which hawkers are in their vicinity, and patronise them. The map
helpfully lists information such as the store name, opening hours, address,
and other useful details. Some of the listings even have short backstories
of the hawkers running the stores and the challenges they have been facing
since the pandemic.</p>
<p>The redditor behind the project said he started the project so that people
have a convenient way to see in one glance hawkers that are near them who
need help.</p>
<p>Do you know a hawker who could do with a helping hand but is not yet on
this map? Contribute by filling up the details in this&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kFwMnj8LLdujRLRsFZ5gAnDDBaFJdjI_HN9NWfQPWQg/viewform?edit_requested=true" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">form!</a>

<h3>Computers against Covid</h3>

</p>
<p>The pandemic has made digital connections all the more important for all
people. Two examples ‚Äì home-based learning has made it essential for students
to have access to computers and with job listings increasingly on online
portals, job seekers also need computers to access the job market.</p>
<p>The charity organisation&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engineeringgood.org/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Engineering Good</a>&nbsp;has
been collecting used devices, refurbishing them, and then distributing
them to low-income families. According to their website, they have distributed
more than 4,000 laptops since May 2021 but are still trying to fulfil requests
of between 150 and 200 laptops a month.</p>
<p>You can&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DBdIFS-28WoLg1fBXoMFPKzsVv0OYxFVkhxl_B8NzrQ/viewform?edit_requested=true" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">donate</a>&nbsp;laptops
and smartphones, as well as laptop accessories such as laptop bags, webcams,
and headsets.</p>
<p>For social services organisations who want to request for devices for
your beneficiaries, you can reach out to the charity at&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@maxoh?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">request4laptops@engineeringgood.org</a>.</p>
<h3>When Friendzone is a good thing</h3>
<p><a href="https://friendzone.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Friendzone</a>&nbsp;started in 2018 as an
event for people living in the same neighbourhood to meet up and bond over
common interests. Meetups were held at void decks with mats and cushions
for people to chill.</p>
<p>Why organise according to geographical location? The people behind Friendzone
found that it was increasingly common for youngsters to lament that only
the older folks interacted with their neighbours or that they felt no attachments
to their neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit, its get-togethers shifted online. There are usually
themes for discussion, such as ‚Äúadulting‚Äù, but the goal is to keep conversations
flowing and encourage deep conversations. These sessions continue to be
organised according to neighbourhoods, although there are monthly sessions
that welcome people islandwide.</p>
<p>While Friendzone is aimed at young adults, there is no official age limit.
As the website says: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre young at heart or even in the life stage
of poly, JC or NS, we welcome you to join us.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Seniors teaching seniors</h3>

</p>
<p>It‚Äôs conventional wisdom that older people have a harder time catching
up with the latest technology, but only one group truly have the lived
experience of such difficulties ‚Äì seniors themselves. That‚Äôs why there
are close to 300 Silver Infocomm Wellness Ambassadors today who share their
digital skills with their fellow seniors regularly.</p>
<p>Aged 50 and above, these ambassadors hold classes and more informal sessions
to empower other seniors with the ability to use technology for things
that interest them, such as finding music from an earlier era and connecting
with family through video calls.</p>
<p>Being from the same generation, they can also better understand the concerns
and anxieties of seniors who are unfamiliar with technology.</p>
<h3>Tech and bonding for the long haul</h3>
<p>Even after the pandemic eventually subsides, it‚Äôs important to lock in
these digital gains and ensure that the bonds forged through tech remain
strong.</p>
<p>Events like Covid-19 have periodically challenged the country, but Singaporeans
have always pulled together to get through the tough times. It‚Äôs no different
now, albeit with tech as a new ally.</p>
<p>We at GovTech certainly hope that our fellow Singaporeans continue to
step up and make a difference.</p>
