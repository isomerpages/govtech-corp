<p>The Health Promotion Board’s (HPB) bold move to get Singaporeans to walk
the talk about getting fit is well, working out.</p>
<p>Soon Khim Soo, IT consultant said: "Designed to encourage Singaporeans
with a sedentary lifestyle to sit less and move more, the National Steps
Challenge (NSC) leverages the use of empowering technology, such as a steps
tracker and HPB’s Healthy 365 mobile app, to nudge participants towards
a more active lifestyle by taking more steps anytime, anywhere."</p>
<p>Through the app, participants are motivated to accumulate steps, track
their diet and see the total calories consumed and expended daily.</p>
<p>It’s brilliantly simple: The more steps you take, the more rewards you
earn.</p>
<p>As of March this year, a total of about 210,000 downloads of Healthy 365
(a top-ranked app for iOS and Android devices) while about 156,000 sign-ups
for the NSC were recorded.</p>
<p>Anyone can download the Healthy 365 for personal tracking, while only
NSC participants earn rewards for achieving milestones.</p>
<p>This incentive system is based on behavioural insights to motivate participants
to increase their physical activity levels progressively and to sustain
this behavioural change in the longer term — such that it becomes a norm.</p>
<p>And it's working.</p>
<p>Since the Challenge started, more than 80% of the participants have clocked
enough steps to win prizes. HPB has joined forces with several partners
across different industries, such as sports and wellness companies, and
food and beverage establishments to offer attractive sure-win prizes at
different stages of the Challenge to motivate participants.</p>
<p>There are useful insights gained too: The information collected also allows
HPB to monitor behavioural changes in relation to physical activity levels
at the individual and population levels throughout the Challenge period.</p>
<h3>First Steps</h3>
<p>The Healthy 365 app began with a pilot in October 2014. It was then progressively
enhanced and rolled out on a national level to support the National Steps
Challenge.</p>
<p>The design team had to overcome potential hurdles for the app such as
power consumption.</p>
<p>It was designed to work in the background and optimises the battery life
of mobile phones because the team provided a low frequency GPS request
so that the operating system can continue operating in the background without
consuming too much power — less than 10% of a day’s use, in fact.</p>
<p>Accuracy was also an issue, as there are a myriad of smartphone models
and the accuracy of the accelerometer tracking varies by brands, models
and even shipments. This is further complicated by how users place their
phones, such as in the pants pocket or handbag, which affects the steps
accuracy.</p>
<p>Said Khim Soo: "To overcome this, HPB decided to develop a common wearable
to achieve a homogenous experience across all participants for the first
season of NSC."</p>
<p>The HPB team also catered for participants without smart phones. They
can go to participating Guardian and Sportslink outlets to sync and update
their step count using the Healthy 365 Tracker Kiosk, which offers a scaled
down version of the app.</p>
<p>Both the app and the kiosk are linked to a common database at the backend
and they share the same mechanism to reward participants for milestones
achieved. The original Healthy 365 and the backend system were planned
and conceptualised to support numerous versions of the same app code-base
for reusability, scalability and fast deployment.</p>
<p>For future seasons of NSC, the strategy is to leverage partners’ app or
other wearable devices to retrieve step count.</p>
<p>The results and feedback from participants have been encouraging for the
team.</p>
<p>"Our data also shows that active participation remained consistently high
at 58% over a four-month period. We have also received suggestions to improve
in areas like user experience, functionality and will take these into consideration
when planning for season 2 of NSC."</p>
<p>This high level of participation is unprecedented, as "it far exceeds
other similar community-based interventions that uses fitness trackers,
such as in the US and Australia, where the total number of participants
did not exceed 4,000".</p>
<p>The next step: Add-ons to expand the functionalities to improve the user
experience for the long term.</p>
<p>"We envision Healthy 365 to be a key health tool that will help Singaporeans
adopt a healthier lifestyle by empowering them to track their physical
activity level and monitor their calorie intake.”</p>
<p>The app will also star in future seasons of the NSC, but the team is stepping
up their game: everything will be ‘bigger and better’.</p>
<p>"We aim to attract many more new participants. There will also be new
challenge categories to reach out to more people at home, at the workplace
and in schools."</p>
<p>Participants can expect more details in the later part of 2016.</p>
<p>But the overall focus goes beyond just the app or the tech.</p>
<p>Added Khim Soo: "Over the years, HPB has progressively raised the ante
on its health promotion efforts, from raising awareness on healthy living
to employing the use of behavioural insights to influence a sustained behavioural
change among Singapore residents to make healthy living a part of their
everyday lifestyle."</p>
