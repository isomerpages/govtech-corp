<h3>Welcome to STACK 2022!</h3>
<p>Members of the tech community across the public and private sectors gathered
in November for the largest Government-led developer conference ‚Äì STACK
2022.</p>
<p>With the opening up of Singapore following the easing of pandemic restrictions,
the event returned to a hybrid format with both in-person and online participants.
Over 2,500 attendees took part in keynote sessions, plenaries, panel discussions,
pre-conference technical workshops and lightning talks from 14-16 November.</p>
<p>Centred on the theme ‚ÄúDesign your Future‚Äù, key industry experts shared
insights and covered topics such as building digital trust, cloud technology,
datafication, fail-safe app development, smart city, and tech culture and
careers.</p>
<p>Minister for Communications and Information, Josephine Teo, delivered
the opening address on the first day of the conference, noting that in
Singapore today, ‚Äú99 per cent of all transactions between citizens and
government can be completed digitally from end-to-end, anytime and anywhere‚Äù.</p>
<p>Mrs Teo, who is also the Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity,
added that this milestone was reached ahead of the target set in 2018 to
have digital services for up to 95 percent of transactions by 2023.</p>
<h3>Cloud and government services</h3>
<p>Indeed, one of the major themes of STACK 2022 was the continued digitalisation
of government services. The modernisation of tech infrastructure through
cloud platforms has played a major role in this, said Mr Paul Tatum, the
executive vice president of solution engineering for the global public
sector at Salesforce.</p>
<p>SaaS, or software as a service, has enabled governments and industry players
to add value quickly by rapidly deploying applications and getting them
out to their users, he said in his keynote on the benefits of SaaS and
PaaS (platform as a service).</p>
<p>He added that his trip to Singapore has been an ‚Äúeye opener‚Äù in terms
of seeing digital government services in action, from the moment he landed
in the country and went through immigration at the airport.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is world class‚Ä¶ and an example for the world on what other governments
should be doing,‚Äù he said.</p>
<h3>Trust in the world of big data</h3>
<p>Another important talking point at the conference was the impact of big
data. With data collection growing ever bigger, people have rightfully
become concerned about its implications for safety and privacy. Big decisions
also increasingly rely on online data.</p>
<p>In such a world, trust is crucial, said Dr Rebecca Parsons, chief technology
officer at Thoughtworks, at her keynote, and people must have the assurance
that data driven insights are unbiased and their data is secure. Systems
and policies must be mutually reinforcing to ensure that users can interact
confidently in the digital world.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur systems are the realisation of our policies. And it doesn‚Äôt matter
what the policy says if our system does something different. So we need
to ensure the systems are doing what we say through our policies that we
want them to do,‚Äù she said.</p>
<h3>Talent and jobs in today‚Äôs hiring climate</h3>
<p>The pandemic has sparked global trends such as the great resignation and
quiet quitting, pushing the topic of careers to the forefront in the last
two years. And with major tech companies restructuring their workforce
recently, the subject has received renewed attention.</p>
<p>This backdrop made for a lively conversation on talent and workplace culture
at the panel discussion. The panellist had a couple of tips for people
who are starting out in their tech careers.</p>
<p>Mr Noah Pepper, a GovTech Board member, stressed the importance of finding
a career that is meaningful to oneself. Such a job will mean one enjoys
the experience of working every day and is far more sustainable in the
long run.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRather than try to optimise what other people think you should be doing
or how to get the best pay package, you will end up happier, do better,
and advance your career faster.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mr Frank Koo, head of Asia, talent and learning solutions at LinkedIn,
emphasised that continual skills upgrading is needed for career longevity
in today‚Äôs rapidly evolving economic and technology landscape.</p>
<p>One should develop a core set of skills but always be on the lookout for
new skills to learn. Workers need to have a growth mindset and be willing
to take ‚Äúintelligent risk‚Äù, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIntelligent risk is about understanding what skills and traits you can
bring to the table. You might not have all the skills for a job opening
and be a 50 to 70 per cent fit. But you must be willing to take on new
responsibilities so you can learn more, stretch yourself beyond your comfort
zone,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>He noted that hiring managers nowadays are also looking beyond qualifications
and past experiences, focusing instead on skills and traits.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe know there are no plug-and-play workers. So many hiring managers are
open to hiring for potential ‚Äì People who are a 50 to 70 per cent fit,
and then help them develop their skills and capabilities so that they can
do the job well,‚Äù he said.</p>
<h3>Cheers for the return of the physical conference</h3>
<p>Conference speakers and attendees alike cheered the return of the physical
event at Suntec after two years of online-only events.</p>
<p>Many noted that such gatherings were critical for industry players to
break out of their daily routine and interact with others from different
technical experiences, given that developers usually come in contact with
others in the same organisation during their day-to-day work.</p>
<p>Chance encounters and serendipitous conversations are also some of the
more valuable experiences that online conferences can‚Äôt provide, they added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think the energy is palpable. And you feel like other people are excited
about the same things that you are excited about. These events create an
oppotunity for people to get to know one another and eventually to work
together.‚Äù said Microsoft‚Äôs Paul Lorimer.</p>
