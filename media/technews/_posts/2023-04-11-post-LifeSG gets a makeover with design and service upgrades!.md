<p><em>New look, greater access to services!</em>
</p>
<p>If you live in Singapore, chances are that you’ve used the LifeSG app
for government services from time to time.</p>
<p>After all, the app provides frictionless and simplified access to digital
government services – whether it’s for something as momentous as registering
your child’s birth or as ordinary as reporting a neighbourhood concern.</p>
<p>To ensure that LifeSG continues to journey with Singaporeans through key
moments in life and daily living, the app recently went through a refresh.
We find out more about the revamp and also speak to the UX team behind
LifeSG to gain insights into the work that went into the overhaul.</p>
<h3>So what’s new with LifeSG?</h3>
<p>LifeSG provides access to a comprehensive list of 400 government services.
For a more intuitive user experience, these services are now categorised
broadly into;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>those for key moments (registering a child’s birth, conducting legacy
planning)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and those for daily life (booking virtual appointments with government
agencies, reporting neighbourhood issues)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A section featuring recent/popular services has also been added to the
home screen so that users can easily reach frequently used services.</p>
<p>Apart from the LifeSG app, users can now also find their desired government
service by using the web search tool to look for information and services
across the top 100 government websites. This greatly enhances LifeSG’s
goal of simplifying access to services and making them easier to find.</p>
<p>All of this is done to bundle multiple transactions into a single seamless
experience. For instance, the birth registration feature enables more than
just registering a child’s birth, but also applying for baby bonus grants
and a library membership. Relevant content from different agency sources
are also carefully curated into guides to serve as support for key services.</p>
<p>“You can think of LifeSG as a toolbox with sets of multitools instead
of single-function tools,” the UX team said.</p>
<h3>Testing the usability of LifeSG</h3>
<p>Two rounds of user testing were conducted with diverse slates of Singaporeans
and permanent residents across age groups, marital statuses, racial groups,
and employment statuses. The participants tried performing various tasks
that involved accessing government services through the app.</p>
<p>The tests were meant to validate whether users can find services easily
and quickly with the refreshed design and whether the prioritisation of
certain services was having the intended effect. There were also tests
on other specific aspects of the app, such as the recent/popular tabs.</p>
<p>These sessions yielded plenty of feedback that the design team used to
improve the app further. For instance, many users who wanted to book barbeque
pits failed because the app design required them to first know which public
agency managed the pit they wanted. Integrating all barbeque bookings eliminated
this stumbling block.</p>

<h3>Leveraging feedback for improvement</h3>
<p>Such improvements involved the development and product teams as well as
collaboration with other government agencies.</p>
<p>“LifeSG is the result of close collaboration with many other government
agencies. This collaboration makes the app useful, but it also means that
we often receive suggestions that we simply have no control over,” the
design team said. “We try to improve what we can improve and respect what
we can’t. But the great thing is that our partner agencies are also very
receptive to user feedback.”</p>
<p>They also have to deal with the unavoidable situation of sometimes receiving
conflicting feedback. After all, different individuals will find different
parts of the app more useful to them. According to the team, this means
finding the right balance between focusing on shared experiences so the
app is relevant to more people and giving users what’s uniquely relevant
to them.</p>
<p>“The challenge for our team is really to find the right balance between
two approaches. Frankly, there’s still a long way to go before we’ll be
able to get that balance right, so the issue of conflicting points of view
is here to stay,” the team said.</p>
<p>This is why it’s important to include as many diverse voices as possible
when considering feedback. “When we’re building an app for such a large
amount of people, it’s inevitable that some features will benefit certain
groups more than others. Hopefully, over time, we’ll be able to gradually
right that balance and give our users what’s uniquely relevant to them,
no matter who they are.”</p>
<h3>Constant work in progress</h3>
<p>Enhancing the user experience is a constant work in progress, and the
team members keep themselves on their toes by being avid users of the app
themselves.</p>
<p>For UX designer Li Ting Kway, the benefits section is what she checks
most often. “It serves as a constant reminder that I have some Skillsfuture
credits left unutilised, so I’m always thinking about what courses I can
sign up with those. I also really like the finances section in the Profile
page, because it gives me a quick overview of my CPF account.”</p>
<p>Of course, continual feedback can be hard to hear sometimes, and the team
acknowledged that as designers, “we do get quite attached to the designs
we come up with, especially if we’ve already devoted time and energy to
making sure they’re the best they can be before testing”.</p>
<p>“We remind ourselves that there is no perfect design out there, and that
everything can always be improved. We’re also aware that different users
have different needs, and sometimes, a design that best fits one group
may not be as useful for another. Knowing that our users come from a diverse
range of backgrounds and perspectives keeps us grounded in the work we
do,” the team said.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, knowing their work has a tangible impact on the
lives of many people is what keeps the team going.</p>
<p>“We recently conducted some user interviews on parents’ experiences using
LifeSG to register their child’s birth, and one parent mentioned that she
didn’t realise a government form could be so simple. She said she’d set
aside an hour to complete the form but had completed it within twenty minutes.
Another parent also mentioned that the joint form was so seamless that
he couldn’t recall having any issues with completing it,” the team said.</p>
<p>“These anecdotes stood out because we all know how exhausting it is for
parents after their child is born, and it felt like we’d made an administrative
process that usually takes energy and time to complete much quicker and
easier. It’s especially humbling when you sit in these user research sessions
and hear from the participants firsthand about their experiences using
our product.”</p>
