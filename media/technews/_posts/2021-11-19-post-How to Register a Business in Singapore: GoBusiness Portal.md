by accessing a centralised platform that simplifies the often complex process
of starting a business. The GoBusiness portal also offers clear, step-by-step
guidance on how to register a business in Singapore, saving valuable time
and reducing costs associated with navigating multiple agencies and applications.
This streamlined approach makes the initial stages of setting up and licensing
a business in Singapore much easier and more efficient for new ventures.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Business owners</h4>
<p>Existing business owners will find significant value in the GoBusiness
portal by gaining easy access to and tracking of essential government services
such as licenses, grants, and various applications. This centralised access
saves considerable time and streamlines numerous administrative processes,
allowing businesses to stay informed on relevant regulations and available
financial support without needing to navigate various government platforms.</p>
<h4>Government entities</h4>
<p>Government entities can also enjoy benefits through the GoBusiness portal
as it supports the digitisation and streamlining of a wide range of public
sector services. By offering a unified and accessible platform, the portal
enhances efficiency in service delivery, significantly reduces administrative
burdens, and improves overall communication and engagement with the business
community. This contributes to better resource management and more effective

<h4>Business consultants&nbsp;</h4>

<h3>Key Features of the GoBusiness portal</h3>
<p>Here are the key services that the GoBusiness portal enables:</p>
<h4>1. Seamless business registration and licensing</h4>
<p>In Singapore, you must register a business if you are carrying out any
activity for profit on an ongoing basis unless you are exempted. The actual
business registration process is conducted via ACRA's BizFile+ portal,
accessible through the GoBusiness platform. This integration streamlines
the registration process, making it more efficient for business owners.</p>
<p>On the GoBusiness portal, would-be entrepreneurs will get a personalised
step-by-step guide on business registration and can then choose to complete
the incorporation within the same transaction. Upon completion of the registration,
there will be suggestions on what to do next, including applying for relevant
licences and grants.</p>

simplifies the application process for these grants, allowing businesses
to apply for various forms of government assistance without the need to
engage with numerous separate agencies and navigate their individual application
requirements. This centralised access saves businesses considerable time

<h4>3. Simplifying all transactions in one personalised dashboard</h4>
<p>An inevitable aspect of running a business is periodic transactions with
the government. However, navigating these interactions has been significantly
simplified and made more efficient thanks to the GoBusiness portal. The
GoBusiness dashboard streamlines over 300 government-to-business services,
some of which include:</p>

</p>
<p>Users can access and apply for more than 200 licences that are administered
by different government agencies, saving them the trouble of visiting separate
portals. They can also easily view the status of all their applications
and will be prompted if any action is required. At the same time, they
can keep track of existing licences and renew or amend them as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Grant recommendations based on business profile</strong>
</p>
<p>There are many government grants that businesses can benefit from, and
the new portal can assess the user’s profile before making recommendations
for relevant grants.</p>

measures for their event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
