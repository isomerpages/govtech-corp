With the new SingPass Mobile app, you don't need to enter long passwords and carry your token around. What’s more, the app just launched two new features. You now get faster access to your important information and favourite digital services!

### **1. Forget about long passwords and having “where’s that token?!” moments.**

Built for convenience, the SingPass Mobile app doesn't require you to memorise long passwords or key in an SMS one-time password to log in. 

You simply have to scan your fingerprint, or hold up your mobile phone for a selfie (facial recognition for selected smartphones), or enter a 6-digit passcode. You can even leave your OneKey token behind when travelling, as all you need is your mobile phone and internet connection to transact online.


### **2. View your information at a glance**

With the MyInfo Profile feature, you can view your passport expiry date, CPF contribution history, HDB property details and more, all in one place!

You don't need to switch between multiple screens to retrieve your personal information. What a way to save time!

When you select ‘View MyInfo Profile’ in the SingPass Mobile app, you'll be prompted to verify your identity using biometric authentication or your six-digit passcode. Thereafter, your profile information will load automatically. The list of information available will grow over time, so keep a lookout for it.


### **3. Access digital services with a tap**

Even as SingPass Mobile becomes increasingly multifunctional, ease of use remains a top priority. Hence, the SingPass Mobile team has implemented an intuitive navigation system for users in the form of Login Shortcuts.

When you launch the SingPass Mobile app, you will see icons of some frequently used digital services, such as those offered by CPF, HDB and NS Portal. Tap on the service you are interested in, verify yourself using biometrics or passcode, and you'll be immediately directed to the relevant services without having to search for them. More shortcuts will be added progressively to make your experience even better.
