<div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Know how to correctly identify CDC vouchers links and avoid getting scammed by fake URLs" src="/images/technews/CDC_SMS_links__scam_or_not_.jpg"></div><p>Earlier this year, the People’s Association distributed $500 worth of CDC (Community Development Council) vouchers to over 1.27 million households. Since then, over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1.1 million</a>&nbsp;or 88% of households have claimed their CDC vouchers.</p><p>That’s all good, but there were a few things that caught our attention that we thought you should take note of, especially for those who have yet to claim their CDC vouchers.</p><p>If you’re collecting your CDC vouchers, here’s what you need to know.</p><h3>How to identify what links are scams…and which are not</h3><p>One of the first things that caught our eye from this latest distribution of CDC vouchers was this WhatsApp message, which was forwarded many times.</p><p>Despite what it says, we want to stress that <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/cdcv</a> is not a scam. We repeat: NOT a scam.</p><p>How do you know it’s not a scam?</p><p>As you can see, the link begins with ‘<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg</a>’. This is a special URL that only public officers can create. These are secure links you can trust – no matter where you encounter them.</p><p>Additionally, the ‘dot’ at the end isn’t included in the clickable portion of the URL. That said, it doesn’t hurt to be vigilant and we appreciate the scepticism. Scammers can create similar-looking URLs to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg</a>. So hypothetical examples include:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go-gov.sg</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gov-go.sg</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.govsg.com</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gov.sg-go.com</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go-govsg.net</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">g0.gov.sg</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go-gov-sg.org</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">govsg-go.org</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go-gov-singapore.com</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gov.sg.go.com</a></p></li></ul><p>For that reason, always look at the URL carefully, and when in doubt, don’t click on links from forwarded messages. Remember, it’s&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg</a></strong>&nbsp;– not anything else!</p><h3>Worst case scenario?</h3><p>Unofficial websites can be used by scammers to collect sensitive information, such as your bank account passwords and other important credentials. This is known as a ‘phishing scam.’ After successfully collecting your details, scammers can log in to your other accounts and wreak havoc on your finances. Like emptying your bank account. Not good. Remember, these unofficial websites can look very much like the real thing, which is why it’s important to look for official URLs.</p><h3>Don’t be fooled by CDC voucher resellers</h3><p>Another thing that happened after the vouchers launched online? Listings of CDC vouchers were soon spotted on online marketplaces, most notably Carousell. According to a report by The Straits Times, a few listings were offering these vouchers for sale.</p><p>Our stand? We strongly recommend not purchasing these vouchers on the secondary market. Trying to buy $500 worth of CDC vouchers for $300 might sound like a good idea, but it’s another opportunity for you to get scammed by unscrupulous e-commerce scammers. After sending your money over to the seller, there’s no guarantee you’ll even receive the CDC vouchers. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p><h3>Claim your vouchers before 31 December</h3><p>While the initial launch of the CDC collections saw many people queuing, it’s important to remember that the CDC vouchers can be both claimed and used until 31 December 2024. Once again, we want to stress that your personal or banking details are not needed to claim CDC vouchers. Finally, if you encounter suspicious messages related to RedeemSG or CDC vouchers, please contact the People’s Association at 6225-5322, the police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or report online at <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.police.gov.sg/iWitness</a>.</p><p>Last but not least, make sure to have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamshield.org.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield</a>&nbsp;installed on your phone to protect yourself from scams! Happy redeeming!</p><p>PS: If you’ve received an SMS from RedeemSG to get your CDC vouchers, the redemption link should start with the following prefix: <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-11-million-or-88-of-s-porean-households-have-claimed-cdc-vouchers-low-yen-ling" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://voucher.redeem.gov.sg</a></p><p></p>
