<h3>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a><a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> portal</a>&nbsp;has been upgraded with new features to make job hunting and hiring more efficient.</h3>
<h4>We spoke with our GovTechies, who worked on the portal and found insider tips on how to increase the chances of finding that ideal match in a competitive job market.</h4>
<p>Everybody wants to land their dream job and build a career in the profession
of their choice. To help match citizens with their ideal roles in companies,
Workforce Singapore, in collaboration with the Government Technology Agency
of Singapore (GovTech), has launched <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a> â€”a one-stop
portal for job hunting, hiring, career advice and industry insights.</p>
<p>We spoke to two GovTechies from the <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a> team, Barry
Lim and Yvonne Chia, who worked on the portal and found insider tips for
jobseekers looking to increase their visibility on <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a>. For employers,
read on to find out how you can use the portal to find that elusive but
exceptional candidate to fill a position.</p>
<h3>For jobseekers</h3>
<h4>1. Add skills to improve your job search</h4>
<p>While educational qualifications are important in the modern economy,
companies are emphasising skills more when evaluating whether a candidate
is suitable for a particular position. Typically, an organisation inputs
a list of skills that it deems valuable to its operations to the <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a> portal.
An algorithm on <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a> will
then scour the applicant database for individuals who have indicated the
relevant skills. It goes without saying, then, that you ought to flaunt
your skills when creating your profile on <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a>.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s how:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Start a search on <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the â€˜Add Skillsâ€™ button</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify skills that you have, and click to add</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Login with SingPass to save the skills to your profile</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Search for jobs on the MyCareersFuture.sg portal" src="/images/technews/6_hacks_to_land_a_great_job_via_MyCareersFuture_sg_2.jpg">
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Build your resume within MyCareersFuture.sg portal to easily apply for jobs and different roles" src="/images/technews/6_hacks_to_land_a_great_job_via_MyCareersFuture_sg_2a.png">
</div>
<p>The more thorough you are in highlighting your capabilities, the more
job opportunities can possibly be made available to you. However, also
take note that the skills you add are appropriate to the kinds of jobs
you are applying for as the algorithm will sort candidates based on how
well they match the job.</p>
<h4>2. Create job alerts to get notified of relevant jobs</h4>
<p>Once youâ€™ve created your profile, youâ€™re all set to start job hunting!
Simply start by searching for your desired job. Alternatively, you can
explore jobs that are popular or in demand.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Match your skills with jobs that require them on the MyCareersFuture.sg portal" src="/images/technews/6_hacks_to_land_a_great_job_via_MyCareersFuture_sg_3.png">
</div>
<p>Timing matters in a job search, and sometimes, your ideal position just
isnâ€™t available yet. Fret notâ€”the <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a> portal allows
you to create a job alert based on your search terms and filters.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s how:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Key in a job title in the search bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on â€˜Create Job Alertâ€™.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Create job alerts for the types of roles that you are interested in." src="/images/technews/6_hacks_to_land_a_great_job_via_MyCareersFuture_sg_4.png">
</div>
<p>This means that you will be automatically notified if new job postings
match your preferences. The database of job postings is refreshed daily,
so the moment a good match is found, you can pounce on the opportunity
and send in your application.</p>
<h4>3. Use government support filters for an added boost</h4>
<p>Maybe youâ€™ve been looking for a job for six months or more. Or perhaps
youâ€™re looking to explore a new field but have no prior experience in it.
Good news, we are here to help increase your chances of landing your next
job.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s what you need to do:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Click on â€˜Search jobs with government supportâ€™ on the main page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Searching for jobs with government support on the MyCareersFutureSg page" src="/images/technews/6_hacks_to_land_a_great_job_via_MyCareersFuture_sg_5.png">
</div>
<p>Browse through job postings that are eligible for government support.
For example, if you see â€˜Government support for individuals between jobsâ€™
next to the job posting, it means that the government will provide wage
subsidies to companies for hiring experienced individuals under the Career
Support Programme.</p>

<h3>For employers</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="MyCareersFuture.sg is also useful for employers to find potential employees" src="/images/technews/6_hacks_to_land_a_great_job_via_MyCareersFuture_sg_7.jpg">
</div>
<h4>1. Use the â€˜Top Matchesâ€™ checkbox</h4>
<p>Letâ€™s face itâ€”hiring managers are flooded with job applications every
day, not all of which are relevant to the position being advertised.
<a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a>can help you cut through the noise with its â€˜Top
Matchesâ€™ function. With just a click of a button, youâ€™ll be able to quickly
view the top matches as assessed by the platformâ€™s two job matching partnersâ€”WCC
and JobKred. For even better results, employers should include the skills
they expect their prospective hires to have in their job postings. This
helps close the loop with the skills information volunteered by jobseekers
while raising the visibility of the job posting.</p>

</div>
<h4>2. Rank applicants by suitability</h4>
<p>Instead of sorting candidates based on the date they submitted their applications,
employers can now categorise candidates according to their suitability
for job postings on <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture.sg</a>. An algorithm
automatically searches through candidate profiles for their skills, work
experience, and education and ranks candidates to facilitate hiring decisions.</p>
<h4>3. Discover hidden talents</h4>
<p>Sometimes, experienced and competent individuals may not be actively looking
for a career transition, but they remain open to job offers and opportunities.
Companies that are looking to hire opportunistically or urgently can view
suggested talents who have been assessed to be a good fit based on how
closely they matched the job.</p>
