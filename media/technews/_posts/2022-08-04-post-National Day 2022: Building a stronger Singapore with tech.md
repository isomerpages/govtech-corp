<p>Many aspects go towards building a nation, and one of the most important
is community. Communities, after all, give different people a sense of
identity and forge common values, ultimately rooting individuals to a country.</p>
<p>In line with this year‚Äôs National Day Parade theme ‚Äì ‚ÄúStronger Together,
Majulah!‚Äù ‚Äì we want to mark Singapore‚Äôs birthday by looking at how tech
can help bond our communities and enhance their resilience for the future.</p>
<p>Read on to find out more about various initiatives and how you can be
a part of them!</p>

<p><em>Check out some initiatives you can take part in this NDP.</em>
</p>
<h3>#DoingGood ‚Äì NDP 2022</h3>
<p>This year‚Äôs NDP has a series of voluntary events collectively known as
#DoingGood. Among the over 80 activities are several tech-focused ones.</p>
<p>For instance, with e-payment becoming increasingly ubiquitous, you can
help seniors gain confidence in using digital payment tools and eventually
experience the convenience of going cashless.</p>
<p>Or you can refurbish donated laptops to make them suitable for use by
low-income families. Tech experts will be on hand to guide you so you don‚Äôt
have to be an IT guru to take part.</p>
<h3>Better.sg</h3>
<p>As its name suggests, <a href="https://better.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">better.sg</a> is all about creating a better Singapore
by building and scaling innovative digital tools to address societal issues.</p>
<p>This volunteer-run&nbsp;organisation&nbsp;helps bring to life a variety
of projects that help different groups of beneficiaries. One tool uses
voice-over-IP tech to aid migrant workers to&nbsp;call home&nbsp;and connect
to their loved ones for free. Another is an&nbsp;online game&nbsp;that
encourages empathy by allowing you to experience a day in the life of someone
from a different background.</p>
<p>You can volunteer in various capacities, be it helping to brainstorm and
develop new tech tools, generate articles and podcasts to spread the word
about #techforgood, or helping to develop <a href="http://better.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">better.sg</a>‚Äôs community by lending a hand with
members‚Äô activities.</p>
<h3>Engineering Good</h3>
<p><a href="https://engineeringgood.org/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Engineering Good</a>&nbsp;is a charity
that helps empower those with disabilities and the disadvantaged through
engineering and technology.</p>
<p>One way it does this is by providing those with disabilities with the
tools to make daily life more convenient. Over the years, volunteers have
delivered projects such as customised writing tools and retrofitted light
switches for those who have limited dexterity with their hands.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the group‚Äôs work is digital inclusion ‚Äì providing devices
and know-how to those who do not have the means to be digitally connected.
They collect and refurbish pre-owned laptops and then distribute these
devices to those in need.</p>
<h3>SG Enable Smart Home</h3>
<p>Another organisation that helps people with disabilities live more independent
lives is SG Enable, which partnered with Google to develop the&nbsp;Smart
Home Guide.</p>
<p>The guide advises about the benefits of smart home devices and how people
with disabilities ‚Äì such as physical disabilities, visual impairment, and
deafness ‚Äì can set up their homes with such conveniences.</p>
<p>For example, people with deafness can programme lights to flicker when
the doorbell rings. They can also set up a light to turn a certain colour
when it‚Äôs raining so that they can quickly close the windows and take in
their laundry.</p>
<p>Small teams of volunteers also work with potential beneficiaries to understand
their needs and how smart devices can improve their way of life. They then
assist in setting up the smart home. The eight-month scheme runs till September
this year and has so far benefited 25 people.</p>
<h3>Singapore Women in Tech</h3>
<p>As tech becomes increasingly important in our society, it is imperative
that tech opportunities are equally accessible to everyone. While 41 per
cent of tech professionals in Singapore are women, well above the global
average of 28 per cent, more can still be done to develop and retain more
women talent in the tech industry.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-push-to-develop-and-retain-more-women-in-tech-sector" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Cross-Polytechnic Girls in Tech Committee</a>,
made up of girls studying infocomm technology courses in the five Singapore
polytechnics, aims to do just that by being a community of support for
girls in tech.</p>
<p>It aims to reach 700 girls each year, and participants will visit companies
and attend workshops by women tech leaders.</p>
<p>They will also be able to take part in the annual Girls in Tech Week in
October.</p>
<p>If you are a woman in tech, do consider taking some time to share your
career experiences with the budding techies of tomorrow!</p>
<h3>Green Plan</h3>
<p>Issues like climate change can often seem too daunting for any one person
to make a difference.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/cna-green-plan/city-nature-2606646" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CNA Green Plan</a>&nbsp;aims
to correct this perception by shining the spotlight on inspiring individuals
who take small steps to go green.</p>
<p>Individuals submitted examples of them doing their part in their day-to-day
lives to promote sustainability.</p>
<p>Some of the winning entries involving tech include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A fitness enthusiast who ‚Äúburns fat, not fossil fuels‚Äù by using exercise
bikes that convert workout energy into electricity to charge mobile devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A supporter of renewable energy installing solar panels on the roof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hand-crafted radio reconfigured from discarded parts of a 40-year-old
radio.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making National Day more than just a public holiday</h3>
<p>Yes, National Day is a much-needed break from our busy school and work
lives, but it can also be so much more than just a public holiday.</p>
<p>Make this National Day period much more meaningful by taking part in efforts
to forge a better Singapore that‚Äôs a home for everyone.</p>
