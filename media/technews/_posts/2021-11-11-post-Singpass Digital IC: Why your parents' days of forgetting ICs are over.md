<p>Hands up if your parents are the type who usually leave their physical
identity card, commonly known as IC, at home because they‚Äôre afraid they‚Äôll
lose it. And hands up if they‚Äôve ever forgotten to bring along their IC
for whatever official business they must settle, even after making a hundred
mental notes the day before.</p>

<p><em>How your Digital IC appears on the Singpass app.</em>
</p>
<p>Well, their days of ‚Äúforgot to bring IC‚Äù are over, thanks to the Singpass
Digital IC! All Singpass users can now see their Digital IC displayed prominently
on the app‚Äôs homepage, and yes, it resembles the physical IC so you can‚Äôt
miss it.</p>
<p>If your folks are the type who need some persuasion to adopt new tech,
here are some ways you can convince them.</p>
<h3>All government agencies now accept the Digital IC</h3>
<p>All government agencies now accept the Digital IC as proof of identity
for in-person services. This includes counter services at government ministries
and agencies, public libraries, and SingHealth polyclinics. Since you‚Äôre
unlikely to forget your smartphone while going out, no more smacking your
head at the counter because you‚Äôve forgotten your physical IC!</p>
<p>There are instances where your physical IC is specifically required by
law, such as for registering a marriage (which probably won‚Äôt matter to
your parents anyway‚Ä¶) and hotel check-ins. The authorities are reviewing
the legislation to formalise the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ifaq.gov.sg/singpass/apps/Fcd_faqmain.aspx#FAQ_1112653" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital ICs for these exceptions.</a>

<p><em>Besides the Digital IC, Singpass is packed with other features! Watch this video to find out more!</em>
</p>
<h3>Safe and secure</h3>
<p>One perennial concern that keeps seniors from using technology is cybersecurity.
They are already unfamiliar with technology, and the added fear of being
hacked turns them off. With the Digital IC, you can assure them that there
are several built-in security and privacy features.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Authentication required to access Digital IC details and profile information" src="/images/technews/Singpass_Digital_IC__Why_your_parents__days_of_forgetting_ICs_are_over_2.jpg">
</div>
<p><em>The Digital IC is kept secure with various security features</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It displays the latest photo you‚Äôve provided to the Government to facilitate
face-to-face verifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only the last four characters of your IC number are displayed on the homepage.
Authentication is required to access the full IC number, and an additional
tap on ‚ÄúShow details‚Äù to reveal full information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that your parents‚Äô personal information is shielded should
they lose their smartphone, compared to having all their information exposed
should they misplace their physical IC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploring your freshly installed app and seeing your IC number in full
without authentication? Don‚Äôt panic just yet! A 2-minute grace period after
each authentication (which you‚Äôve done during app setup!) lets you navigate
the app easily before authentication is requested again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an animated and holographic lion crest on the Digital IC. The
crest is absent or appears static when someone attempts to capture a screenshot
or recording of the Digital IC. (Go on, try to take a screen recording
of your Digital IC and see what happens!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If malicious apps are detected on the device, the app will not be usable
until the threat is removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your parents lose their device, they can also remotely deactivate their
Singpass app on the Singpass website or install the app on another device
to automatically deactivate it on the lost device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, most of us now protect access to our smart devices with pins
or biometric options, adding another layer of security.</p>
<h3>An important step towards Smart Nation</h3>
<p>When we think of life in Singapore, ‚Äúpink IC‚Äù is one of the things that
inevitably comes to mind. We‚Äôve used it at every life milestone ‚Äì from
national examinations to National Service, ROM, HDB applications and more.
Our IC has indeed come a long way from the laminated cards in the 60‚Äôs
to the polycarbonate cards issued in the 90‚Äôs that we know today.</p>
<p>The digitalisation of this document, which is a core part of life here,
is a small yet fundamental step in our progress as a Smart Nation. Today,
94% of government services are digital from end-to-end, mobile penetration
is high, and the use of e-payments is prevalent. Having an important document
like the Digital IC with you in your smartphone opens possibilities for
a digital wallet and brings us one step closer to leaving our homes without
bulky wallets in our pockets!</p>
<p>Wait, before you go ‚Äì please remind your parents that just like how they
will not allow others to photocopy their ICs without a good reason, they
should not let others take pictures of their Digital IC or send screenshots
of it to friends or strangers! Yes, there are security measures in place,
but we should still play our part to keep our digital identity safe.</p>
<p>GovTech currently partners with the SG Digital Office (SDO) through the
Seniors Go Digital programme to support users who may need help picking
up digital tools. If your parents or friends need help, they may visit
any SG Digital Community Hub for a 1-on-1 consultation with a Digital Ambassador
or contact us at <a href="https://www.ifaq.gov.sg/singpass/apps/Fcd_faqmain.aspx#FAQ_1112653" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">support@singpass.gov.sg</a>.</p>
