<h3>User feedback is important when developing and deploying government digital services. GovTech has developed a tool as part of the Whole-of-Government-Application-Analytics - called Sentiments - to help agencies understand the experiences and emotions of users better.</h3>
<p>How do you know if a product or service is working well and if it isn't,
how it can be improved? Feedback forms and surveys immediately come to
mind, but recruiting participants and compiling the subsequent results
represent a very manual way of understanding how people feel about certain
product features or specific aspects of service delivery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when you're a government running more than 300 websites with
an accumulated 200 million visits and more than one billion minutes of
use, gathering user feedback can be a convoluted process. This is where
technology and digital tools can help public officers get a sense of how
people feel about government digital services more efficiently.</p>
<p>At the Public Sector Infocomm Seminar held at the NTUC Centre on 26 March
2019, Mr Lingesvaran Palanisamy from the Government Digital Services team
at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) shared how a
Whole-of-Government Application Analytics (WOGAA) applicationâ€”named â€˜Sentiments'â€”is
helping to streamline the gathering of feedback from the ground.</p>

<h3>User experience: going beyond usability</h3>
<p>"According to user experience design, you always advocate that a product
should be built based on users' feedback," Mr. Palanisamy explained. "There
are three important questions to think about: firstly, what do citizens
think of our services? Secondly, what kind of problems are they facing?
Lastly, how can I actually solve this problem for them?"</p>
<p>As he and his team were working on Sentiments, Mr. Palanisamy began to
notice a potential disconnect between usability and user experience. Just
because something can be used doesn't mean that someone will want to use
it.</p>
<p>"Good usability is essential but not sufficient for securing good user
sentiment," he said. A website could be functioning well during the testing
phase, but when it is deployed and used by thousands of people, certain
technical issues may surface that mar the user experience, contributing
to negative user emotions such as confusion or frustration, he added. Being
able to capture those reactions when they arise and pinpoint the reasons
behind them is what Sentiments was built for.</p>

<h3>A listening tool based on data</h3>
<p>By crunching large datasets of interactions between citizens and a website,
for example, Sentiments can provide public officers with insights into
how a digital service is faring in the eyes of its users. It can even highlight
specific parameters surrounding the use of a website that likely contributed
to positive or negative emotions.</p>
<p>"For example, a happy user's loading time for a webpage was three seconds,
and you can see they are using the Windows operating system running Google
Chrome on a desktop. [On the other hand], everything is the same for an
unhappy user except the internet browser, so maybe some pages were not
configured properly for that browser. This is how Sentiments can tell you
what the users went through for them to give [the website] a particular
rating. When a problem appears in a huge number of datasets, we know it
is something we have to fix."</p>
<p>Equally important is the fact that Sentiments can segment users into different
demographics. A website can be serving several groups of users, but only
one group may be encountering issues that exasperate them. Rather than
overhaul the entire site, targeted small tweaks can be made to cater to
the needs and preferences of this minority.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, inclusiveness is a crucial tenet of digital governance
in Singapore, and Sentiments helps developers in government make sure that
digital services are delivered seamlessly for all. "Sentiments is not an
ordinary user satisfaction tool. Here, we are actually combining WOGAA
data and Sentiments data to understand citizens' experiences and emotions
better," said Mr. Palanisamy.</p>
