<p>As a small, resource-scarce nation, Singapore’s energy consumption is
disproportionately high. To meet our growing energy needs, artificial intelligence
(AI) is being used to optimise the harvesting of solar power. Additionally,
AI is enabling the predictive maintenance of Singapore’s numerous elevators,
ensuring that they run smoothly, and in an energy-efficient manner.</p>
<hr>
<p>Despite its reputation as cutting-edge technology, artificial intelligence
(AI) has actually been around for nearly half a century. As early as the
1950s, the English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing had
already raised the idea of machines that could think, and by the 1970s,
nascent forms of machine learning had appeared, albeit mainly dealing with
simple automation.</p>
<p>Notably, the processing power of computers back then imposed a strict
upper limit on the capabilities of AI.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few decades, however, and today’s blazing fast graphics
processing units allow computations to be completed within seconds where
they would have taken days in the past, said Dr Thomas Ho, department head,
Smart Energy and Environment, at the Institute of Infocomm Research (I2R).
He was speaking at the AI leader’s forum on 15 May 2018, where he explained
how AI is now being applied to solve one of Singapore’s most pressing issues—sustainability.</p>

<h3>Little red dot, big energy needs</h3>
<p>Small as it may be, Singapore is one of the top consumers of electricity
in the world, said Dr Ho. Furthermore, unlike other energy guzzlers such
as the United Kingdom, whose power consumption has remained relatively
steady over time, Singapore’s usage has continued to increase. Dr Ho called
this an “alarming problem”, given that Singapore is resource-scarce and
therefore must rely heavily on other countries rich in fossil fuels.</p>
<p>“As Singapore becomes more and more technologically advanced, and as the
number of gadgets attached to human beings increases, we can only expect
our energy consumption to increase further,” he warned.</p>
<p>To address this growing demand for energy, Singapore is exploring renewable
energy sources, which will not only reduce the city-state’s reliance on
fossil fuels, but also shrink its carbon footprint.</p>
<p>“For Singapore, being in the tropics, the obvious and immediate answer
is to use solar power,” said Dr Ho, highlighting, as an example, a public
housing block in Ang Mo Kio which uses solar energy to power its lifts,
lights and water pumps.</p>
<h3>Finding a brighter solution</h3>
<p>But simply installing solar panels on the rooftops of apartment blocks
does not solve the problem of intermittency—the amount of electric power
generated from sunlight varies with weather conditions and the time of
day. Batteries are thus required to store excess power during peak energy-harvesting
hours for use at a later time.</p>
<p>However, since batteries cannot be charged and discharged at the same
time, being able to schedule charge and discharge cycles in sync with weather
forecasts and usage patterns is essential. “You have to schedule energy
storage and factor in the amount of sunlight that you are likely to harness,
and whether the amount [of energy collected] is sufficient for use by the
apartment block,” said Dr Ho, adding that the system must know when to
draw more electricity from the energy grid should solar power fall short.</p>
<p>“Hence, we use AI in this management system. We let the machine run an
optimisation algorithm to find the best solution to adopt at any time of
the day,” he explained.</p>
<p>Dr Ho further noted that the data being fed to the AI had to be of high
quality, since having substandard data informing the AI algorithm could
result in unwanted outcomes, such as power outages. Therefore, the system
was also designed to automatically evaluate data quality—almost like a
human making decisions about which news sources to trust.</p>
<h3>Taking elevators to a whole new level</h3>
<p>In addition to tackling the challenge of energy demand, Dr Ho also shared
how AI is facilitating the maintenance of elevators—a ubiquitous feature
in Singapore, given its large number of high-rise buildings. He highlighted
the persistent issue of lift breakdowns, causing people to be trapped in
lifts.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be good if we could give the elevator intelligence, for it
to tell us, ‘I think I’m going to break down soon, probably in the next
week or two’?”</p>

<p>Using sensors and a microcontroller, Dr Ho explained that the remaining
lifespan of each mechanical part in elevators can be estimated automatically,
and the in-built AI even recommends servicing timelines. This means that
engineers know precisely when to perform pre-emptive maintenance and which
elevator parts need replacing.</p>
<p>Over the long run, ensuring that elevators operate in prime condition
contributes towards their energy efficiency, since less electricity is
consumed to overcome the effects of wear and tear, Dr Ho noted.</p>
<p>“These are the small things we do with the hope of making Singapore a
more sustainable nation,” Mr Ho concluded.</p>
