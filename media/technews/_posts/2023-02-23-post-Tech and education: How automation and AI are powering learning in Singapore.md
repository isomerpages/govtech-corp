<p>The education sector has gone through huge changes in recent years. With
massive open online courses gaining popularity, attending classes with
an instructor in front of a physical room is no longer the only way to
learn.</p>
<p>The pandemic has only accelerated this trend, as students and educators
alike were forced to adapt to circumstances and had to fully embrace online
learning.</p>
<p>Yet the industry is still evolving rapidly, with automation and artificial
intelligence set to make a big impact. Here‚Äôs a look at some of the changes
that are already underway.</p>
<h3>Automated English marking systems</h3>
<p>As part of Singapore‚Äôs national AI strategy, the Ministry of Education
is working on rolling out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.snec.com.sg/news/academic-medicine/singapores-artificial-intelligence-strategy-applying-ai-to-help-not-replace-people" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">automated marking systems</a>&nbsp;for
primary and secondary English language assignments such as open-ended,
short-answer questions and essays.</p>
<p>These AI-powered systems will catch language errors such as in grammar,
spelling and syntax. The teacher will focus on higher level concepts such
as marking for ideas, structure, content, creative expression, persuasiveness,
and tone. MOE believes this will enable teachers to spend less time on
routine assignments, giving them more time to design effective lessons
and strengthen relations with students.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the system is its ability to collect data on common
grammar mistakes so that teachers can work on these areas with their students.</p>
<p>The ministry will not be using these systems for marking exams, including
the Primary School Leaving Examination.</p>
<h3>Adaptive learning systems for mathematics</h3>
<p>Students learn at a different pace, and a teacher often has to deal with
a class where some have already grasped the concept while others are still
struggling. To address this, MOE has been trialling an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/contact-mar20.ashx" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">adaptive learning system</a>&nbsp;enhanced
by machine learning that can assess student performance in real-time and
adjust their learning pathways accordingly.</p>
<p>In one school, students completed modules on maths subjects before class,
and teachers received reports on their performance. In the classrooms,
the students were able to ask better questions about the subject and discuss
how maths could be used in real-life situations.</p>
<p>The teachers could also mix students of different abilities together so
that they could do peer learning and teaching.</p>
<p>Those working on the system are now taking in teachers‚Äô feedback, such
as the need for more localised examples and the ability for students to
enter their mathematical work into the programme.</p>
<h3>AI-enabled learning companion</h3>
<p>Another project from the Smart Nation initiative is the development of
an AI-enabled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/files/publications/national-ai-strategy.pdf" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">learning companion</a>.
It will be able to support holistic learning by motivating the student
while he or she is doing a challenging task, encouraging reflection on
the learning experience, and recommending further learning activities.</p>
<p>While the use of AI as a learning companion is still relatively new, there
are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/why-ai-can-better-help-students-as-learning-buddy-not-teacher" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">promising areas</a>&nbsp;to
explore. For example, AI can be used to detect a student‚Äôs engagement level
with the study material by tracking the student‚Äôs eye moment and the duration
spent on specific parts of the document.</p>
<p>For maths problems, the companion can identify the part that is presenting
problems for the student and provide hints, resources, or prompts for an
alternative method.</p>
<p>While recognising AI‚Äôs potential as a learning companion, it is also important
to acknowledge its limitations. For instance, interpreting a student‚Äôs
behaviour during the learning process might be a task that is complex for
AI. Can it correctly read the facial expression of a student and tell if
he or she is concentrating or simply spacing out?</p>
<h3>Training teachers to use AI</h3>
<p>With technology rapidly evolving, teachers must keep up with changes and
upskill accordingly. The National Institute of Education&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/nie-to-train-teachers-in-using-ai-in-classroom-invest-in-research" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;in
May 2022 that it will step up efforts to train teachers to employ AI in
teaching.</p>
<p>By 2026, topics about artificial intelligence in education will be offered
for trainee teachers at all levels, including undergraduates, post-graduate
and in-service teachers. As part of a five-year plan called AI@NIE, the
institute will also invest in research and innovation to use artificial
intelligence for education.</p>
<h3>AI as a complement, not a replacement</h3>
<p>Even as Singapore explores ways to increase AI‚Äôs usage in education, experts
and officials have reiterated that technology will never fully replace
the crucial role that teachers play in educating and guiding students.</p>
<p>After all, teachers are not just repositories of facts and figures that
are regurgitated to students. They nurture, inspire, and encourage young
minds to stretch their curiosity. They also provide human communication
and support as youngsters mature and find their place in the world. These
are roles that AI will not be able to take on.</p>
<p>As Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative, Vivian Balakrishnan
said: ‚ÄúAt the heart of education is interaction‚Ä¶ I do not believe that
AI will ever replace teachers.‚Äù</p>
