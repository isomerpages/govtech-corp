public sector organisations to continually improve in this aspect, the
government holds the annual Digital Services Awards, which honour agencies
that have demonstrated excellence in their online offerings.</p>

<p>This year’s award presentation, held in November, was attended by about
650 public officers from over 70 government agencies. Guest of Honour Dr
Janil Puthucheary underscored that it was crucial for the whole of government
to embrace technology.</p>
<p>“When we talk about digitisation in Singapore, we’re not talking about
a small subgroup of public service; this is about getting it out to our
nation, our society, and every citizen that we serve,” said the Senior
Minister of State for the Ministry of Communications and Information.</p>
<p>The CPF Board and Ministry of Education walked away with the top prizes.
CPF’s Informational Service Team bagged the “Best Usability – Accessibility”
and “Most Popular Informational Service” awards, while MOE’s Corporate
Website Team won “Best Usability – Citizens’ Choice”.</p>
<p>These teams emerged on top through a nomination and judging process spanning
six months.</p>
<p>The websites went through vigorous assessment by judging panels comprising
private and public sector tech experts as well as leaders of special needs
organisations such as the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped.</p>
<p>After the judges picked their top three choices, they were turned over
for citizen evaluation. The finalists for “Best Usability – Accessibility”
were scored by 46 citizens comprising persons with disabilities and those
over 65 years old, while the finalists for “Best Usability – Citizen’s
Choice” were assessed by 106 citizens from all age groups.</p>
<p>To underscore the importance of the user experience of everyday folks,
the citizens’ assessment made up 70 per cent of the final score, while
expert judges’ evaluations made up the remaining 30 per cent.</p>
<p>As Dr Janil, who is also Minister-in-Charge of GovTech, said: “We have
to be inclusive as an approach. Our seniors especially, where it is not
just about whether they have access to the technology or the skills, but
also the language where we have to think through the user experience very
deeply. We also have to take into consideration the needs of people with
disabilities, visual, audio, intellectual and motor impairments.”</p>
<p>These citizen evaluators, who were recruited from SGEnable, A11y, Tech
Kaki and CrowdTaskSG, were given a set of tasks to perform on the websites
to familiarise themselves with the site’s functions. They then answered
questions on the usability and accessibility of each website, such as whether
all the banners and links worked and if the site had unnecessary complexities.</p>
<p>As technology gets increasingly important in our lives, digital government
services will also become more integral to interactions between Singaporeans
and the public sector. Dr Puthucheary cited the country’s response to the
Covid-19 pandemic as an example of digital services playing a crucial role.</p>
<p>“Circuit breaker, national mask distributions, vaccinations and finally,
travel. At every step of the way, our government digital services were
a necessity,” he said.</p>
<p>In all, a total of 18 awards were presented to government agencies that
delivered excellent functionality and usability in their digital services.
