<p>The internet ‚Äì we rely on it for everything from work (especially when
working from home), entertainment (video streaming, mindless surfing, you
name it), and even sustenance (hands up if your guilty pleasure is ordering
bubble tea delivery).</p>
<p>How did this cyberspace make its way to our shores and change our lives
forever? We‚Äôre hopping into a time machine to trace its journey from niche
toy to ubiquitous tool. Only have 2 minutes? You can watch the video below
too!</p>

<p>Short on time? Catch this video to find out how the internet landscape
changed in Singapore.</p>
<h3>1987 ‚Äì Connection to Bitnet, the internet‚Äôs precursor</h3>
<p>Take this as the prequel to the internet‚Äôs origin story. Bitnet was a
network connecting over 600 computers in academic institutions ‚Äì mostly
in the US, Canada, and Europe. In 1987, Singapore‚Äôs National University
of Singapore&nbsp;linked up to Bitnet.</p>
<p>NUS would go on to play a central role in bringing the internet to Singapore.
It established the&nbsp;country‚Äôs first connection&nbsp;to the internet
in 1990. A year later, NUS began operating&nbsp;Technet, which connected
R&amp;D and academic institutions. But even as things were picking up pace,
such digital communication did not touch the lives of the vast majority
of Singaporeans.</p>
<h3>1994 ‚Äì Dawn of the internet for the masses</h3>
<p>For most of us, this was the year it all began.&nbsp;Singtel launched
SingNet, which offered public access to the internet as well as an email
service. If you ever come across an email address with "singnet" in it,
you‚Äôre looking at an early adopter in Singapore.</p>
<p>Two other Internet Service Providers (ISPs) would enter the fray in quick
succession: Pacific Internet in 1995 and Cyberway in 1996, shaking up the
landscape to the benefit of consumers.</p>
<p>These were also the days of dial-up modems and their&nbsp;tell-tale connecting
tone&nbsp;(imagine R2-D2 with a sore throat and cold) while connecting
through the home phone landline. Older millennials no doubt remember your
folks screaming at you to ‚Äústop messing with the computer‚Äù so that they
could make a call (yeah, handphones were rare back then too. Truly the
Dark Ages).</p>
<h3>1998 ‚Äì Need for speed as broadband launched</h3>
<p>After a year-long successful pilot programme, the&nbsp;<a href="https://graphics.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/Interactives/2015/10/35-years-of-ict/supercharging-singapore/the-1990s.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore One national broadband network</a>&nbsp;was
commercially launched and gradually rolled out to households. The buzzwords
then were ‚Äúcable‚Äù or ‚ÄúADSL‚Äù, the two ways to enjoy surfing speeds more
than 100 times faster than a dial-up connection. Singapore CableVision
(SCV) provided the cable service that also incorporated cable TV services,
while Singtel ran the ADSL network through phone lines.</p>
<p>While take-up was slow at the beginning, Singapore eventually became one
of the countries with the highest broadband penetration rates, with more
than&nbsp;nine out of ten&nbsp;residential households having broadband
connections.</p>
<p>Both cable and ADSL began losing popularity and were eventually decommissioned
about&nbsp;two decades&nbsp;after their debut, thanks to a new kid on the
block: fibre broadband.</p>
<h3>2006 ‚Äì Cutting the cord with Wireless@SG</h3>
<p>As accessing the internet on the go with laptops became increasingly important,
the government launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/wireless-at-sg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wireless@SG</a>&nbsp;to
deliver high-speed wireless connectivity. Over the years, the programme
was enhanced with faster surfing speeds and a more seamless login process
using SIM card credentials or through the Wireless@SG app.</p>
<p>Today, there are over 6500 hotspots across the islands in&nbsp;locations&nbsp;such
as shopping malls, schools, hospitals, MRT stations, hawker centres, and
community centres.</p>
<h3>2007 ‚Äì Smartphone revolution begins</h3>
<p>The smartphone‚Äôs instant popularity ‚Äì&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/6/26/15821652/iphone-apple-10-year-anniversary-launch-mobile-stats-smart-phone-steve-jobs" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fuelled in part by the iPhone</a>&nbsp;‚Äì
changed the way we use the internet. Seemingly overnight, everyone was
carrying a mini-computer with internet access in their pockets.</p>
<p>While 3G services had been available since 2005, they never caught on
until smartphones‚Äô bigger screens and usage of apps became widespread and
bred new habits.</p>
<p>Commutes became a chance to be lost in your own world, head bowed over
a screen. Debates during lunch over what is the highest-grossing movie
of all time were settled instantly by whipping up the smartphone and checking
Wikipedia.</p>
<h3>2013 ‚Äì Fibre broadband points in every home</h3>
<p>Fibre broadband, the current broadband network in Singapore, reached the&nbsp;milestone
of nationwide coverage&nbsp;in 2013, with easily recognisable bright yellow
optical fibre cables deployed to all residential and non-residential premises.</p>
<p>This infrastructure enabled truly fast and furious surfing speeds, with
Singapore regularly topping ‚Äúspeediest internet lists‚Äù.</p>
<h3>2013 ‚Äì 4G nationwide coverage</h3>
<p>Our smartphone addiction no doubt became more acute when all three telcos
at that time ‚Äì Singtel, M1, Starhub ‚Äì achieved&nbsp;<a href="https://graphics.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/Interactives/2015/10/35-years-of-ict/supercharging-singapore/2010-and-beyond.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nationwide 4G coverage</a>,
making bandwidth-intensive activities like streaming videos possible on
the go.</p>
<h3>To the future and beyond</h3>
<p>What‚Äôs next for the internet in Singapore? The country is aiming to have
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singtel-launches-5g-trial-services-in-singapore-second-telco-after-starhub-to-do-so" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nationwide 5G</a>&nbsp;coverage by 2025. Boosting speed and coverage is
essential to implementing Internet-of-Things (IoT) initiatives such as
the&nbsp;smart lamppost&nbsp;project, equipping lampposts with sensors
for better monitoring of environmental factors like rainfall and humidity.</p>
<p>As Singapore works towards becoming a Smart Nation, the internet will
only continue to gain importance in our lives. We hope this trip down memory
lane has been a nice, nostalgic, and informative one that lets you appreciate
how far we have come and how far we can go!</p>
