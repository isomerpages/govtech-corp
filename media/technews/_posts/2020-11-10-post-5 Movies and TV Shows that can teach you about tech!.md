<p>We‚Äôve all heard that tech is the future and that we should learn something
about it. But there‚Äôs a difference between thinking about it and actually
doing it. After a long, hard day at work, it‚Äôs just so much more appealing
to vegetate in front of a screen, consuming content from our favourite
streaming service.</p>
<p>Well, if starting an online coding course is a bridge too far, check out
the following recommendations of TV shows and films that can teach you
a thing or two about tech and make your daily viewings less of a guilty
pleasure.</p>

<p><em>While you sit back and enjoy the movie, remember to learn something!</em>
</p>
<p>[SPOILER ALERT] The rest of the article explores the themes and premise
of popular TV shows and films. While there will be no specific revelations
(‚ÄúHe was the killer she was hunting all along, gasp!‚Äù), there will be discussions
that take in broad plot developments (‚ÄúWhat starts out as a comedic farce
about office politics evolves into a sombre morality tale). Don‚Äôt read
on if you can‚Äôt stomach these.</p>
<h3>Silicon Valley!</h3>
<p><em>What you can learn: Life in the tech start-up ecosystem</em>
</p>
<p>Set in the titular homebase of all things tech, this comedy series revolves
around a bunch of programmers who are brilliant at coding but not so great
at getting a company up and running.</p>
<p>We go through everything about start-up life together with our merry band
of misfits, from boardroom machinations between founders to how&nbsp; venture
capitalists&nbsp;can be the maker and crusher of entrepreneurial dreams.
We even get a helpful 101 on the&nbsp;Scrum&nbsp;workflow in an episode
where the long-suffering head of business development tries to instill
some discipline and structure to the freewheeling team.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also the rivalry with a fictional giant tech firm that will stop
at nothing to bring its opponent to heel, reminiscent of the ongoing debate
about whether the largest Silicon Valley companies are engaging in&nbsp;
monopolistic behaviour.</p>
<p>As the real-life image of tech went from universal force for good to potential
purveyor of evil in the wrong hands in recent years, the show also takes
a turn for the dark in exploring the ethical dilemma of whether a few guys
who wrote a bunch of code should have this much power and influence over
vast swaths of humanity. Watch out for&nbsp;cameos&nbsp;from actual tech
moguls and journalists for an added dose of realism.</p>
<h3>The Great Hack</h3>
<p><em>What you can learn: Data and social media‚Äôs impact on democracy</em>
</p>
<p>It has now been widely reported that social media can be exploited to
influence elections, but the relentless news cycle can make it difficult
to remember the details. The Great Hack takes an unsparing look at how
political consulting firm&nbsp;Cambridge Analytica&nbsp;harvested data
from tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent and then
used that information in the course of their work for various political
campaigns. The ensuing public outcry when the scandal came to light compelled
Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress and
magnified calls for greater regulation of social media.</p>
<p>Weaving together the voices of several key figures, including whistleblowers
and investigative journalists, the documentary will imbue you with a healthy
degree of scepticism every time you are assured by boilerplate language
on some website that ‚Äúyour data is safe with us‚Äù.</p>
<h3>The Social Dilemma</h3>
<p>*What you can learn: Users-as-product business model of social media</p>
<p>The Social Dilemma is very much a companion piece to The Great Hack, but
the former examines the impact social media has on personal, everyday life.
Featuring interviews with tech veterans and behavioural specialists, it
drives home its key message: tech products are designed to be as addictive
as possible, and we are paying for them with our unceasing attention.</p>
<p>The film intersperses expert interviews (‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not paying for the
product, then you are the product‚Äù) with a fictional story of social media‚Äôs
negative impact on a suburban family. In one sequence, the pre-teen daughter
suffers body-image issues because of comments on an uploaded photo. In
another, the teenage son is radicalised by going down a rabbit hole of
online videos served up by a recommendation engine that surfaces similar
content.</p>
<p>Together with The Great Hack, this docu-drama hybrid forms a one-two punch
in waking us up to the manipulative effects of social media.</p>
<h3>West World</h3>
<p><em>What you can learn: Ethical questions in tech</em>
</p>
<p>West World starts as a series about a theme park filled with life-like
robots that, when playing their roles as inhabitants of America‚Äôs Old West,
are indistinguishable from humans. Real people visit the West World to
experience fantasy lives as cowboys, as well as engage in all sorts of
consequence-free debauchery and twisted violence against the robots. Once
dead, the robots are fixed and reset, as good as new.</p>
<p>But what if the robots gain the ability to remember their pain and suffering
even after reboots? And at what point does a robot‚Äôs ability to simulate
emotion, feeling, and experience transition into true sentience?</p>
<p>The latest third season takes place outside the park, where we see a society
in which predictive analytics rules all aspects and determines a person‚Äôs
lot in life. This mirrors the real-world debate of what are the&nbsp; pitfalls&nbsp;and
where to draw the line in our embrace of AI in decision-making.</p>
<p>Of course, there‚Äôs also the visceral pleasure of watching Singapore depicted
as a city of the future in season three, which was partly&nbsp;shot here.
Our sunny island even gets name-dropped when two characters have a drink
at an opulent watering hole (Atlas Bar in Parkview Square).</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnother simulation? Well, this one‚Äôs a bit over the top,‚Äù says one, while
taking in her surroundings.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo Maeve, this is Singapore.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Black Mirror</h3>
<p><em>What you can learn: Implications of tech in the near future</em>
</p>
<p>If robots that make minced meat out of the&nbsp;Turing Test&nbsp;seem
too far off, then check out Black Mirror instead. This series that originated
in Britain grounds itself by taking inspiration from the tech that already
exists and pushes the premise off-kilter.</p>
<p>How off? Well imagine a world where the only way to avoid watching commercials
on ubiquitous screens is to pay a fee. Or one where your social media rating
determines the priority you get in a queue. Yes, there is the occasional
episode about killer machines, but the chills are mostly from the creeping
sensation that ‚Äúit could very well come true‚Äù.</p>
<p>If all these sound unbearably bleak, know that Black Mirror also contains
one of the most uplifting tales of tech on TV in the episode San Junipero.</p>
<h3>Mr Robot</h3>
<p><em>What you can learn: Cyber security and the world of hackers</em>
</p>
<p>You know this series isn‚Äôt playing around with keeping things real when
the lead character drops terms like ‚ÄúTor networking‚Äù, ‚Äúonion routing protocol‚Äù,
and ‚Äúexit nodes‚Äù in the very first episode, even before the title card
makes its debut appearance.</p>
<p>Mr Robot ‚Äì about a cybersecurity engineer leading a double life as a vigilante
hacker ‚Äì earned&nbsp;widespread praise&nbsp;for its&nbsp;authenticity&nbsp;from
various cybersecurity firms. Watching this show can get you educated about
cybersecurity terms like&nbsp;DDOS&nbsp;and how weak passwords are like
using tissues to absorb a tidal wave.</p>
<p>If you find yourself furiously changing your passwords and being paranoid
about every phone call with your bank, this show would have done its job.</p>
<h3>So there you have it!</h3>
<p>5 Movies and TV shows which are not only entertaining, but also sets your
mind racing when it comes to questions of ethics and how technology are

to watch on Movie Night perhaps try out some of the shows on this list!</p>
