<p>What do Luke Skywalker, Bucky Barnes AKA the Winter Soldier, and Robocop
have in common? Beyond being fictional heroes, they are also outfitted
with prosthetics that are just as good (some would say even better than
real limbs).</p>
<p>While we may not be there yet in the real world, the quality of artificial
body parts has nonetheless improved by leaps and bounds in recent years
thanks to the technology of 3D printing.</p>

</p>
<p>Late last year, a man in Britain became the first person in the world
to be fitted with a&nbsp;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/25/health/3d-printed-eye-scli-intl-gbr-scn/index.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3D-printed eye.</a>&nbsp;The
prosthetic is more life-like than those produced using previous methods,
and the procedure was also less invasive, as the patient‚Äôs eye socket was
scanned digitally instead of having a mould of the socket made.</p>
<p>Of course, this is far from the first breakthrough made possible by 3D
printing. For instance, the technology has already been deployed in fields
such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/3d-printing-can-solution-nations-affordable-housing-crisis-rcna10725" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">construction.</a>
</p>
<p>In this article, we‚Äôll focus on the impact that 3D printing is having
on products that we put on (or into) our bodies. But before we get there,
a quick introduction to what exactly is 3D printing.</p>
<h3>So what‚Äôs 3D printing?</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôve ever had a printer at home and printed your school essay, you
would have seen how the printhead runs back and forth the sheet of paper,
almost like it‚Äôs inking layer by layer.</p>
<p>Well, a 3D printer works pretty much the same way, except that it‚Äôs making
a three-dimensional object by laying on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hp.com/sg-en/shop/buying-guide-3d-printer" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">successive thin layers of material</a>&nbsp;according
to a digital blueprint. And yes, much like there are home-use and industry-grade
ink printers, there are 3D printers that are suitable for personal use,
which you can use to get up to all sorts of&nbsp;<a href="https://all3dp.com/1/useful-cool-things-3d-print-ideas-3d-printer-projects-stuff/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">home projects!</a>
</p>
<p>With that, let‚Äôs get back to the main topic: impactful uses of 3D printing.</p>
<h3>Prosthetic limbs</h3>

</p>
<p>Just like the example of the 3D printed eye, 3D printed prosthetic limbs
bring a new level of aesthetics, although the look is more cyberpunk mimicking
human flesh.</p>
<p>Besides being much more customisable to ensure better fit and comfort,
the designs are also eye-catchingly futuristic, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://newatlas.com/exo-prosthetic-leg-3d-printing/35297/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">see-through legs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/26/the-future-of-3d-printed-prosthetics/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">bionic-like arms</a>&nbsp;and legs straight out of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-amazing-bionic-prosthetics-that-are-changing-lives-and-shaping-our-future" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">video games.</a>
</p>
<p>Oh and these prosthetics come with the added benefit of faster manufacturing
time at lower costs.</p>
<h3>Casts and splints</h3>

</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve ever fractured an arm or a leg and had to put on a cast, you
would know how much of a pain it is. The thing is heavy, ugly, and, oh
yeah, starts to smell funky as a good part of you is enclosed for months.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitfab.io/blog/3d-printed-splints/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3D printed casts</a>,
on the other hand (haha), are lighter, more customisable to your body shape,
and its rigidity can be adjusted according to what kind of injury you‚Äôre
rehabilitating.</p>
<p>The designs can also incorporate the colour of your choice and cool, lattice
patterns that are not just pleasing to the eye but also breathable. And
the material is even waterproof (traditional cast wearers have been known
to wrap their casts in plastic bags while taking a shower)!</p>
<h3>Dental implants</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>Dental implants like crowns, retainers, and dentures are usually expensive
and take a long time to produce. Given how distressing a dental issue can
be ‚Äì you can‚Äôt eat, drink, talk, or even laugh without pain ‚Äì the wait
time is a literal pain in the mouth.</p>
<p>Traditional manufacturing of dental implants is also largely analogue,
with the quality of the product and its fit to a patient highly dependent
on the skill of the attending technician.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://dental.formlabs.com/blog/digital-dentistry-dental-3d-printing/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3D printing</a>&nbsp;has
made it possible for faster customisation that digitally scans the patient
instead of relying on moulds, improving accuracy and patient comfort. The
3D printing process also enables greater precision in crafting artificial
teeth or aligners that are unique to patients.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Yes, you read that right, food. Instead of just using material like plastic,
edible materials can be used as well.</p>
<p>While&nbsp;<a href="https://all3dp.com/2/3d-printed-food-3d-printing-food/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3D printed food</a>&nbsp;has
not reached a mass market level (yet), it is nonetheless opening up possibilities
of creating intricate designs and personalised meals. I mean, just look
at some of these 3D-printed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.3dsourced.com/3d-printers/chocolate-3d-printer/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">chocolates</a>&nbsp;and
tell me they aren‚Äôt too beautiful to be eaten.</p>
<h3>I‚Äôm intrigued, how do I get started?</h3>
<p>Three regional libraries (Jurong, Tampines and Woodlands) have 3D printing
machines that the public can freely use. Housed within MakeIT on the premises
of those libraries, these machines are part of dedicated public maker spaces
with equipment for people to try out various forms of digital and traditional
fabrication, including 3D printing, robotics, and other forms of tech-based
tinkering.</p>
<p>Only people who have attended one of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.sg/cc/makeit-at-libraries-programmes-104559" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3D Starter Sessions</a>&nbsp;will
be allowed to reserve and use the 3D printers in MakeIT at Libraries. The
three-hour introductory lesson will teach newcomers the fundamentals of
3D printing, including how to create and edit 3D digital models, as well
as safely turn them into actual items using the 3D printers in MakeIT.</p>
<p>If you would like even more training, there are a number of SkillsFuture-approved
courses such as a two-day course run by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools-and-courses/adult-learners/all-courses/skillsfuture-series/basic-computer-aided-design-cad-3d-modelling-and-3d-printing.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Temasek Polytechnic.</a>
</p>
<p>And as mentioned above, 3D printers are suitable for home use too. So
if you‚Äôre really excited about this technology, why not buy one to fiddle
around with at home?</p>
