<p>What do Luke Skywalker, Bucky Barnes AKA the Winter Soldier, and Robocop
have in common? Beyond being fictional heroes, they are also outfitted
with prosthetics that are just as good (some would say even better than
real limbs).</p>
<p>While we may not be there yet in the real world, the quality of artificial
body parts has nonetheless improved by leaps and bounds in recent years
thanks to the technology of 3D printing.</p>

<p>Late last year, a man in Britain became the first person in the world
to be fitted with a&nbsp;<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/25/health/3d-printed-eye-scli-intl-gbr-scn/index.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">3D-printed eye.</a>&nbsp;The
prosthetic is more life-like than those produced using previous methods,
and the procedure was also less invasive, as the patient‚Äôs eye socket was
scanned digitally instead of having a mould of the socket made.</p>
<p>Of course, this is far from the first breakthrough made possible by 3D
printing. For instance, the technology has already been deployed in fields
such as construction.</p>
<p>In this article, we‚Äôll focus on the impact that 3D printing is having
on products that we put on (or into) our bodies. But before we get there,
a quick introduction to what exactly is 3D printing.</p>
<h3>So what‚Äôs 3D printing?</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôve ever had a printer at home and printed your school essay, you
would have seen how the printhead runs back and forth the sheet of paper,
almost like it‚Äôs inking layer by layer.</p>
<p>Well, a 3D printer works pretty much the same way, except that it‚Äôs making
a three-dimensional object by laying on&nbsp;successive thin layers of
material&nbsp;according to a digital blueprint. And yes, much like there
are home-use and industry-grade ink printers, there are 3D printers that
are suitable for personal use, which you can use to get up to all sorts
of&nbsp;home projects!</p>
<p>With that, let‚Äôs get back to the main topic: impactful uses of 3D printing.</p>
<h3>Prosthetic limbs</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Just like the example of the 3D printed eye, 3D printed prosthetic limbs
bring a new level of aesthetics, although the look is more cyberpunk mimicking
human flesh.</p>
<p>Besides being much more customisable to ensure better fit and comfort,
the designs are also eye-catchingly futuristic, such as&nbsp;see-through
legs, bionic-like arms,&nbsp;and legs straight out of&nbsp;video games.</p>
<p>Oh and these prosthetics come with the added benefit of faster manufacturing
time at lower costs.</p>
<h3>Casts and splints</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="3D printing a custom-made cast" src="/images/technews/Blood__Flesh_and____3D_printing__3__.jpg">
</div>
<p>If you‚Äôve ever fractured an arm or a leg and had to put on a cast, you
would know how much of a pain it is. The thing is heavy, ugly, and, oh
yeah, starts to smell funky as a good part of you is enclosed for months.</p>
<p>3D printed casts, on the other hand, are lighter, more customisable to
your body shape, and its rigidity can be adjusted according to what kind
of injury you‚Äôre rehabilitating.</p>
<p>The designs can also incorporate the colour of your choice and cool, lattice
patterns that are not just pleasing to the eye but also breathable. And
the material is even waterproof (traditional cast wearers have been known
to wrap their casts in plastic bags while taking a shower)!</p>
<h3>Dental implants</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Structure of dental implant and how different components can be 3D printed" src="/images/technews/Blood__Flesh_and____3D_printing__4_.jpg">
</div>
<p>Dental implants like crowns, retainers, and dentures are usually expensive
and take a long time to produce. Given how distressing a dental issue can
be ‚Äì you can‚Äôt eat, drink, talk, or even laugh without pain ‚Äì the wait
time is a literal pain in the mouth.</p>
<p>Traditional manufacturing of dental implants is also largely analogue,
with the quality of the product and its fit to a patient highly dependent
on the skill of the attending technician.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;3D printing&nbsp;has made it possible for faster customisation
that digitally scans the patient instead of relying on moulds, improving
accuracy and patient comfort. The 3D printing process also enables greater
precision in crafting artificial teeth or aligners that are unique to patients.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Graphic of burger being 3D printed using organic materials" src="/images/technews/Blood__Flesh_and____3D_printing___5_.jpg">
</div>
<p>Yes, you read that right, food. Instead of just using material like plastic,
edible materials can be used as well.</p>
<p>While&nbsp;3D printed food&nbsp;has not reached a mass market level (yet),
it is nonetheless opening up possibilities of creating intricate designs
and personalised meals. I mean, just look at some of these 3D-printed&nbsp;chocolates&nbsp;and
tell me they aren‚Äôt too beautiful to be eaten.</p>
<h3>I‚Äôm intrigued, how do I get started?</h3>
<p>Three regional libraries (Jurong, Tampines and Woodlands) have 3D printing
machines that the public can freely use. Housed within MakeIT on the premises
of those libraries, these machines are part of dedicated public maker spaces
with equipment for people to try out various forms of digital and traditional
fabrication, including 3D printing, robotics, and other forms of tech-based
tinkering.</p>
<p>Only people who have attended one of the&nbsp;3D Starter Sessions&nbsp;will
be allowed to reserve and use the 3D printers in MakeIT at Libraries. The
three-hour introductory lesson will teach newcomers the fundamentals of
3D printing, including how to create and edit 3D digital models, as well
as safely turn them into actual items using the 3D printers in MakeIT.</p>
<p>If you would like even more training, there are a number of SkillsFuture-approved
courses such as a two-day course run by&nbsp;Temasek Polytechnic.</p>
<p>And as mentioned above, 3D printers are suitable for home use too. So
if you‚Äôre really excited about this technology, why not buy one to fiddle
around with at home?</p>
