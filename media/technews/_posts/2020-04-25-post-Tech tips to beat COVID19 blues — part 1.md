<h3>While technology can never fully replace the human touch, here are six ways that technology is making life during the ‚Äòcircuit breaker‚Äô more enjoyable.</h3>
<p>As the worldwide movement to embrace social distancing gains traction,
individuals and organisations alike are scrambling to adapt to the new
realities of life.</p>
<p>Whether it‚Äôs a work-from-home arrangement or online parties, technology
has become indispensable when it comes to accepting the new normal. Here‚Äôs
a list of tech tools to help you navigate these challenging times.</p>
<h3>1. Meet people online</h3>
<p>Travel restrictions and social distancing have prevented face-to-face
meetings between family, friends and colleagues. So it comes as little
surprise that video conferencing tools like Zoom and Google Hangouts have
taken centerstage. Equipped with bells and whistles‚Äîlike Virtual Backgrounds,
more on that later‚Äîit is ultimately Zoom‚Äôs ability to accommodate large
groups for video conferences or classroom lectures that give it an edge
over its competitors.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre keen to avoid a video conference faux pas like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4f9AYRCZY" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">‚ÄòBBC Dad‚Äô</a>&nbsp;or
just want to hide the clutter in your room, take advantage of the Virtual
Background feature. This feature allows you to display custom images or
videos in the background. Additionally, Zoom lets you record video calls.
This can be handy for students who want to revisit course materials and
lectures.</p>

<h3>2. Get organised with Airtable</h3>
<p>Keeping tabs on multiple projects when your colleagues are cocooned at
home can be cumbersome. Enter Airtable, a free-to-use cloud collaboration
service that promises to make organising projects easy. Its spreadsheet
design‚Äîwhich is similar to Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets‚Äîfeels familiar
and easy to work with. Airtable also provides several ready-to-use templates
for a variety of activities including marketing and product planning, making
it easy for new users to get started.</p>
<p>Airtable accommodates many types of data and allows you to switch between
different views like a Kanban board, an image gallery or a calendar. It
can also help set up web forms and collate responses within the same table
for easy reference.</p>
<h3>3. Let‚Äôs TraceTogether</h3>
<p>Contact tracing normally requires significant time and resources. But
the recently launched TraceTogether app that hopes to mitigate the spread
of COVID-19 through community-driven contact tracing, will make the task
much simpler. Using Bluetooth signals, the app records the presence of
other TraceTogether users nearby. If someone tests positive for COVID-19
and provides their data to the Ministry of Health (MOH), MOH can inform
potential contacts over the phone.</p>
<h3>4. Embrace the outdoors</h3>
<p>Physical activity is important for our health, mood and productivity.
If you‚Äôre thinking of taking a walk outdoors or going for a trail run,
make sure it‚Äôs not too crowded by visiting an online portal named&nbsp;
<a href="https://safedistparks.nparks.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Safe Distance @ Parks</a>. Co-developed by GovTech and NParks, the website
allows you to check how crowded a park is in advance so that you can plan
your outing accordingly.</p>
<p>The portal monitors the real-time visitors of major parks and green spaces
with the help of data gathered by staff on the ground and aerial photographs
taken by drones. NParks has advised that people should avoid areas where
footfall is high and return home as soon as they complete their exercise
to free up space and allow others to use the park.</p>

<h3>5. Stay healthy with home workouts</h3>
<p>Are parks too crowded? Fret not. Plenty of YouTube and Instagram videos
and apps catering to varying fitness goals provide home workouts you can
bank on. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fiton-fitness-workout-plans/id1442473191" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FitOn app</a>&nbsp;offers
free exercises designed by celebrity trainers, ranging from pilates to
high-intensity interval training sessions.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôd like to support local fitness experts while working on your health
goals at the same time, why not try&nbsp;<a href="https://circle.myactivesg.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ActiveSG Circle</a>,

Singapore. With 88 verified instructors in piloxing, Zumba, yoga and more,

<h3>Protect your mental well-being</h3>
<p>Much of life, as we know, has changed in a remarkably short time thanks
to COVID-19. Protecting our mental well-being is as imperative, if not
more, as keeping our bodies fit and healthy in these trying times. If you‚Äôre
feeling overwhelmed by the current situation, try practising mindfulness
through meditation. While it might seem daunting at first, plenty of meditation
apps, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calm.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Calm</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.headspace.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Headspace</a>, are available to guide you through the process. Take a
deep breath and remind yourself that this, too, shall pass.</p>
