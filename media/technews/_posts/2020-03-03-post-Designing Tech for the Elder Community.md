<h3>GovTech and the National University of Singapore collaborated to conceptualise a wearable personal alert button for the elderly that can be used to summon emergency services.</h3>
<p>An increasing number of senior citizens in Singapore are living alone,
many of whom may not have loved ones living nearby or may be estranged
from their relatives. The Department of Statistics, Singapore, estimates
that there will be 83,000 elderly persons living alone by 2030.</p>
<p>Recognising that this growing subpopulation may be unable to get help
when they need it most—for instance when they have a fall or are feeling
faint—the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) envisioned
a future where each elderly individual has an ‘SOS’ system on them at all
times.</p>
<p>While GovTech has installed personal alert buttons (PABs) in the homes
of senior citizens, the existing solution is not portable, which means
that an elderly person may be unable to send out a distress call if an
emergency occurs outside his or her home. Watch the video below to find
out how this system is helping the elderly who are living in Pulau Ubin!</p>

<h4>Innovation by design</h4>
<p>Rather than brainstorm internally, the GovTech team decided to tap on
an ally from academia—the National University of Singapore’s Division of
Industrial Design (NUS DID). In June 2019, GovTechies visited the NUS DID
showcase and were impressed by the students’ creativity in problem-solving.</p>
<p>“We approached NUS Associate Professor Song Kee Hong and proposed a ‘mini
hackathon’ of sorts to crowdsource ideas for a wearable PAB for the elderly,”
said Ms Joy Ng, User Experience Designer at GovTech. “The problem statement
we issued was: How might we design a wearable that will help seniors who
are living alone to call for help when needed?”</p>
<p>Seven teams from NUS DID took up the challenge, bringing diverse skillsets,
including design thinking, engineering and behavioural science, to the
table. Over the course of 13 weeks, they researched the problem and came
up with ideas that aligned with the objectives of the GovTech Assisted
Living Ecosystem—enabling the elderly to age in their homes, stay within
their community and maintain an independent lifestyle.</p>
<p>The entries were judged by experts from the Government Digital Services
and Sensors and Internet of Things divisions of GovTech, which meant that
everything—from the hardware to the software and user experience of the
proposed solutions—came under scrutiny.</p>
<h4>Thinking out of the box</h4>
<p>Keeping the end users in mind, the NUS teams first spent a few weeks interacting
with the elderly at senior activity centres and various heartland areas
to understand their needs and preferences surrounding the use of wearable
PABs.</p>

</div>
<p>“I don’t feel the need for an extra device” and “I won’t use it if it
gets in the way of my activities” were some of the notable insights that
surfaced from engaging with the elderly. It appeared that senior citizens
were not averse to technology per se, but wanted technology to be easy
to use and seamlessly integrated with their lifestyles.</p>
<p>Armed with these insights, the NUS teams then proceeded to conceptualising
and designing their wearable PABs. This was a phase where ideas evolved
rapidly; some teams saw their design concept shift from ‘a smart mini plush
toy’ into ‘something more practical and worn closer to the body’.</p>
<p>The functions of the potential devices also extended beyond the primary
requirement of sending a distress signal, to include social engagement
and vital signs monitoring. The teams were clearly thinking out of the
box, finding ways to weave their solutions into a larger ecosystem of apps
and digital services.</p>
<h4>Unpolished gems uncovered</h4>
<p>Eventually, three frontrunners emerged among the participating teams.
One prototype that caught the eye of the GovTech judges was Buddy, a clip-on
badge with a round touchscreen interface that displays a smiley face by
default.</p>

</div>
<p>Meant to be worn on the elderly individual’s shirt sleeve, Buddy not only
allows the wearer to contact emergency services anytime and from anywhere
but also provides the wearer with social engagement via its expressive
and versatile screen. Studies have shown that many senior citizens also
experience social isolation, so a ‘smart companion’ like Buddy could help
keep loneliness at bay.</p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Another innovative solution for the elderly which can make life easier for them" src="/images/technews/Designing_Tech_for_the_Elder_Community_4.jpg">
</div>
<p>Another innovative solution, called Omi, took the form of a three-part
system comprising a wearable wristband, a home system, and audio sensors.
The wearable wristband is to be worn by the elderly when they leave their
homes, but when they return home, it can be docked at the home system for
charging. At home, the audio sensors placed throughout the house sync with
the home system to passively detect any sounds of distress, and the devices
can be voice-activated to call for emergency services.</p>
<p>However, the team that emerged as the overall winners had a unique take
on the PAB—an ear-mounted device called Cradle. Touted by the team as the
‘Airpod for seniors’, Cradle’s creators noted that the device’s position
at the ear puts it in proximity to several of the major blood vessels in
the head and neck. This would allow Cradle to continuously monitor heart
rate and oxygen levels in the blood in addition to fall detection. At the
touch of a button, Cradle will also allow the wearer to contact emergency
services.</p>

</div>
<p>“We thought that Cradle was the most innovative and original concept for
a wearable PAB,” said Ms Ng. “It was something that our team probably would
not have thought of ourselves because we were too familiar with the project’s
constraints.”</p>
<p>Such is the beauty of crowdsourcing innovation—new perspectives and unexpected
designs can converge to result in a practical outcome. “GovTech will perform
further work on the initial design, as well as explore its reliability,”
Ms Ng said. “It might be possible to create a workable prototype in the
future and test it with actual users to measure acceptability.”</p>
