<p>If you havenâ€™t heard, Apple is finally ditching the lighting cable and
moving to USB-C for all iPhones.</p>
<p>Concerned about sustainability and e-waste, the European Union recently
suggested that all smartphones should use the USB-C standard. So it has
come to pass that your iPhoneâ€™s lightning cable might go the way of the
Dodo.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t feel too sad though. The lightning cable wonâ€™t be the first to go
obsolete. Neither will it be the last.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, technology advances and cables come and
go. Chances are, youâ€™re holding on to some of these cable dinosaurs in
some hidden corner of your house.</p>
<p>How many of them do you recognise?</p>

<h3>Apple 30-pin</h3>
<p>Found on: Old Apple Devices Making its debut in 2003 on another extinct
device â€“ the iPod classic â€“ the Apple 30 pin went on to appear on many
iconic devices of the early 2000s. The first-generation iPhone used this,
so did the iPod touch.</p>
<p>It wasnâ€™t just Apple that utilised the 30-pin though. The rise of Apple
throughout the decade also meant that many third-party manufacturers incorporated
the 30-pin into their designs. If you look at hotels last renovated pre-2010s,
you can sometimes still find the 30-pin dock in their entertainment systems.
Of course, all good things come to an end. The lightning cable appeared
in 2012, and Appleâ€™s love affair with the 30-pin died with the iPhone 4S
and iPad 3 in 2014.</p>
<h3>DVI</h3>
<p>Found on: TVs and Monitors Long before the days of HDMI in the late 1990s,
human beings used DVI (Digital Virtual Interface). This clunky cable allowed
you to reach resolutions of up to 2,560 x 1,600, and while it did not provide
any audio connections, it was groundbreaking for sure back then. Less so
today.</p>
<p>Experiences with the DVI cable were mostly frustrating and fiddly. There
was always a chance you could bend the pins inside, damaging the cable.
Fortunately for us, the reign of the DVI lasted around a decade. By the
2010s, newcomers such as DisplayPort and HDMI started to offer much higher-quality
imaging. Most monitors today come with HDMI ports â€“ which offer audio support.</p>
<h3>VGA</h3>
<p>Found on: TVs and Monitors Even older than DVI, is VGA, or Video Graphics
Array. This cable often comes in black and blue and debuted in 1987 on
ultra-boxy IBM computers. The cool thing about VGA â€“ which hipsters might
enjoy â€“ is that itâ€™s analog technology. That means signals were transmitted
via digital pulses. Not 1s and 0s.</p>
<p>Say what you will about the VGA cable, but it has had a remarkably long
career for a cable. The DVI replaced it in 1999, yes, but you can still
find some VGA adaptors today sold at electronics stores â€“ mostly to ensure
backwards compatibility. Thatâ€™s 34 whole years! And it's just about time
for retirement.</p>
<h3>Composite Cables</h3>
<p>Found on: TVs, and some very old monitors, VCRs, Game Consoles. Like the
mythical hydra, the legendary composite cable has â€“ you guessed it â€“ three
heads, in red, white and yellow. Like the VGA, itâ€™s an analog technology
that past its heyday â€“ which was in the pre-2000s.</p>
<p>If you owned a Playstation (1) in the 1990s, you might have remembered
using these to connect to your television. Same with the Video Cassette
Recorder (VCR). Like the VGA and DVI, HDMI and display have more or less
replaced them.</p>
<p>For some weird reason though, modern-day TVs still have these ports. Our
guess is that itâ€™s used to ensure backward compatibility with VCRs â€“ which
amazingly still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/style/vhs-tapes.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">see use.</a>&nbsp;Itâ€™s
only a matter of time â€“ so donâ€™t feel too attached to them!</p>
<h3>Coaxial</h3>
<p>Where you might have seen it: Set-top boxes, TVs, wall ports (which connect
to networks). When we say this cable is old, we mean it. The submarine
transatlantic cables that facilitated telegraphy first used an early variant
of this technology â€“ back in 1858! Amazingly, this cable is still used
for cable and the internet in some parts of the world. Make no mistake,
when they say â€˜cable TVâ€™ â€“ this is the cable they are talking about.</p>
<p>If you subscribed to Singapore Cable Television (later it became Starhub
Cable TV), in the 1990s to early 2000s, you might recognise this cable.
Itâ€™s used to transport signals from a satellite to a TV, or a setup box.</p>
<p>Most consumers wonâ€™t be needing this one though, at least in Singapore.
Singapore completed its national Fibre Optics Network as early as 1998
â€“ which is why coaxials are being replaced by all over the world. For cable
users, Starhub Cable TV migrated all its customers to a fibre-optic network
in November 2019, firmly cementing the fate of the trusty coaxial cable
as an obsolete tech locally.</p>
