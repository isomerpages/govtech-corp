<p>TL: DR: GovTech’s approach to digitalisation is not just technology for
technology’s sake, said chief executive Kok Ping Soon. Instead, it involves
a fundamental re-think of the government-citizen relationship. The goal
is to go beyond providing frictionless services to delighting citizens.</p>

<p>These days, you can apply for a new passport, file your taxes and renew
your library books all from the comfort of your home—or even on your mobile
phone. One of the reasons all this is possible is that the Singaporean
government has been committed to digitalisation since the 1980s, explained
Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) chief executive Mr
Kok Ping Soon.</p>
<p>“We have services that are well-acknowledged to be among the most comprehensive
and responsive [in the world]; but we want to do even more,” said Mr Kok,
speaking at the East-West Centre’s International Media Conference held
at Singapore Management University from 24-27 June 2018.</p>
<p>For GovTech, “more” doesn’t mean simply chasing the latest technology
fads or spicing up press releases with trendy buzzwords. Instead, going
digital requires a completely different approach, one that radically alters
the relationship between the government and its citizens, Mr Kok said.</p>
<p>“What that means is that the ambition of the Singapore government is not
about digitalising for digitalisation’s sake. It’s not about taking existing
forms and putting them onto the web,” he continued. “It is a fundamental
re-thinking, re-imagining and re-engineering of our government processes.”</p>
<p><strong>From ministry-centric to moments of life</strong>
</p>
<p>In the past, digital services were thought of as a “linear value chain”
that began with policy formulation and ended with technology implementation,
Mr Kok explained. Singapore’s 16 different ministries and 84 agencies were
organised accordingly, with structures that facilitated the flow from policy
makers to operational staff who design a project’s specifications and finally
to technology suppliers in charge of building the system.</p>
<p>But citizens do not interact with the government in such a linear fashion.
A new mother, for instance, would need to register her child’s birth, apply
for the Baby Bonus scheme and access her child’s immunisation and medical
records, services that would require her to approach three different government
agencies: the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, the Ministry of Social
and Family Development and the Health Promotion Board respectively.</p>
<p>With the Moments of Life (Families) app launched in June 2018, all this
and more can be done within a single app instead. Apart from helping parents
to register the birth of a child and apply for the Baby Bonus scheme with
a single form, the Moments of Life (Families) app also allows them to locate
nearby childcare centres, as well as check how full each centre is.</p>
<p>The app is just one example of how the government has re-organised itself
and integrated services around the needs of its citizens, Mr Kok said.
As the name suggests, the moments of life approach will be extended to
non-parents as the government continues to re-think services from the perspective
of its citizens.</p>
<p>“Why stop at parents with young kids? What about helping working adults
to stay relevant in the workforce or find new jobs? What about helping
retirees?” Mr Kok asked. “We’re taking the moment of life approach deeper
in each of these moments, as well as spreading [the approach] across different
moments.”</p>
<p><strong>From engagement to co-creation</strong>
</p>
<p>Another thing that the government is now doing differently is getting
citizens involved as early as possible, partnering them to co-create new
services rather than simply collecting feedback after the service has been
launched.</p>
<p>“It used to be that when we delivered digital services, citizens were
the subject of study. We did focus groups to find out their needs and develop
services for them. Citizens were involved, but somewhat downstream [in
the process],” Mr Kok said.</p>
<p>“Now, we want to find platforms for us to co-create solutions with citizens.
Because who better to tell us where the pain points are than the citizens
themselves? One of the Digital Government Blueprint strategies is to co-create
with citizens, businesses and industry solutions that are meant for them.”</p>
<p>Co-creation has proven to be a productive approach, particularly in the
realm of transportation. For example, GovTech’s Beeline app makes public
transport data available to private bus operators, allowing them to crowdsource
demand for point-to-point bus services and adaptively plan their routes.</p>
<p><strong>From satisfactory to delightful</strong>
</p>
<p>Ultimately, digitalisation should be about treating the citizen as a customer
and providing services that do not just satisfy but actually delight them,
he added. “If we can deliver services that are easy to use, seamless and
secure online, all we have done is reduce the inconveniences [of everyday
life]. But doing more to delight citizens might be foreign to governments
because unlike private companies, we are not trying to maximise revenue,”
Mr Kok said. Nonetheless, it is essential for governments to embrace the
“law of the customer” and focus on the needs of its citizenry, he said.
To do this, GovTech starts developing new services by first going through
what it calls a ‘service experience journey,’ evaluating every interaction
with the government from the perspective of the user.</p>
<p>“Developing services in this way requires us to do things very differently,
in a more agile manner. It requires the government to change its thinking
and the way we approach policies,” Mr Kok said. “At the end of the day,
building a smart nation requires a new level of partnership between the
people, the private and the public sector.”</p>
