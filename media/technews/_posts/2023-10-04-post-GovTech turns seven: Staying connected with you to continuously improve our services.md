<p>GovTech turns 7 this year! It did seem just like yesterday when we were
formed with the goal of helping Singapore reach its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/who-we-are/our-role/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation objectives.</a>
</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve created many services and products that many Singaporeans
find invaluable today. Some of these you’ll definitely recognise: think
Singpass, CrowdTaskSG, ScamShield and GoBusiness.</p>
<p>Behind every one of these apps is a team that works tirelessly behind
the scenes. You would think that this refers to only the engineers and
UX designers in GovTech.</p>
<p>But nope! Users also play a crucial role in our product design where they
provide valuable feedback to improve the services for users. On our 7th
birthday, we took the opportunity to ask some of our product teams how
the everyday user impacts their final products.</p>
<p><em>Editor’s note: Make sure to check out our birthday page&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/gt7-article" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. We promise you, it’s well worth your while.</em>
</p>
<h3>Singpass: Redesigning for enhanced vigilance</h3>
<p>The design team at Singpass collects feedback and conducts surveys, interviews,
and usability testing regularly to better understand users’ behaviour during
transactions and continually improve the Singpass service for 5 million
users. Since 2022, Singapore has seen a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20221002_advisory_on_phishing_scams_involving_singpass" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">surge in scams</a>,
including phishing for Singpass login details and misusing Singpass accounts.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main/security/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">better protect users</a>&nbsp;against
evolving scams, the Singpass team examined the effectiveness of the Singpass
app consent screen in helping users spot fraudulent activities during transactions.
The team conducted a 2-week user research study with selected Tech Kaki
community members, where participants performed login tasks with different
design prototypes, to observe user behaviours when logging in and inspire
design changes.</p>

</div>
<p>The login screen was redesigned in August 2023 to display only pertinent
information, like the e-service name and colour-coded approval buttons,
to encourage users to check the details carefully and clearly communicate
the security significance of this screen. Sometimes, less is really more.</p>
<h3>CrowdTaskSG: It doesn’t get more user-centric than this</h3>
<p>Get rewarded for your feedback, what could be better? Sharing your thoughts
through CrowdTaskSG allows users to earn virtual coins that be used to
redeem real-life rewards!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdtask.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CrowdTaskSG</a>, if you haven’t guessed
from the name, is a crowdsourcing web portal which taps the collective
intelligence of Singaporeans through crowdsourcing tasks, such as surveys
and polls.</p>
<p>Upon completing tasks, citizens are rewarded with virtual coins that can
be used to offset purchases at any retail, food and beverage establishments,
and major supermarkets accepting NETS QR payment mode.</p>
<p>It’s a way for citizens to share their perspectives about government initiatives,
allowing agencies to consider such feedback when creating programmes. During
its beta launch in 2022, one of the most common pieces of feedback was
that it was challenging for users to redeem rewards. This led the team
to revamp the reward system.</p>
<p>Previously, users had to accumulate a minimum of $5 worth of virtual coins
in value, before the coins could be exchanged for NTUC vouchers.</p>
<p>Today, with the integration with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wallet.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GovWallet</a>,
users can simply use any amount of their coins to offset their purchases
at any NETs QR participating merchants immediately.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, CrowdTaskSG also worked with the Singpass team on a
Scam Quiz campaign to educate and equip citizens with the knowledge to
protect themselves from potential phishing scams. As this was not the typical
survey task type, the CrowdTaskSG team had to create and support quiz functionalities
on the portal to support the campaign.</p>
<p>But it was well worth it – the quiz received around 200 responses a day,
and more than 2,600 responses in total which came in invaluable to the
Singpass team</p>

<h3>Public feedback: Front and centre of the ScamShield Bot</h3>
<p>Scams are becoming more sophisticated, making it increasingly difficult
for citizens to discern what is genuine. Recognising this growing threat,
Open Government Products, in collaboration with the Singapore Police Force
and NCPC, brought the ScamShield App and more recently, the ScamShield
Bot, to life.</p>
<p>What role did the public play? A big one.</p>
<p>For starters, the ScamShield Bot puts powers in the hands of the public,
enabling users to conveniently check and report scams received from across
multiple platforms directly to the Singapore Police Force, all neatly within
WhatsApp.</p>
<p>In addition, ScamShield Bot can check against crowdsourced information
– it can tell you how many others have also reported a similar message
or contact.</p>
<p>This was a direct result of multiple rounds of user testing, knowing that
others have reported a similar scam reinforces public awareness and caution.</p>
<p>Finally, ScamShield Bot also has a feature that allows users to see the
impact of their actions, showing statistics on the number of scams reported,
and how their reports have helped others to identify these scams.</p>
<p>This level of transparency and acknowledgement acts as a motivator for
continued community participation in scam prevention.</p>
<p>In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, the ScamShield Bot is an example
of how we can harness technological innovation and community engagement
to create a safer, more secure Singapore for our citizens.</p>

<h3>GoBusiness: Helping Singapore become more business-friendly</h3>
<p>Now, Singapore is already one of the easiest places to start a business
in the world. But part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GoBusiness</a>&nbsp;team’s
remit is to make it even easier. To do so, the team regularly gathers feedback
from users via multiple channels such as the GoBusiness websites, from
our partner government agencies and from businesses directly. To get a
more in-depth understanding of businesses’ needs, the team also place an
emphasis on on-the-ground engagements.</p>
<p>That’s why the team has also expanded their outreach efforts by engaging
with trade associations and chambers, as well as participating in business
conferences. Call it qualitative research!</p>
<p>These efforts enable the team to gain a deeper understanding of the various
regulatory challenges that businesses encounter throughout their business
journey.</p>
<p>For example: One frequent feedback was that users were unsure about the
grants available to them or which ones they were eligible for.</p>
<p>In response, the team created an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/gov-assist/#:~:text=Find%20out%20with%20e%2DAdviser,needs%20to%20get%20our%20recommendations." class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">e-Adviser for Government Assistance</a>.
This is a tool to help businesses narrow down the relevant assistance schemes
that they can apply for.</p>
<h3>We want to be better – so give us feedback!</h3>
<p>As we celebrate our 7th year, we are more committed than ever to keeping

year of creating better, more inclusive experiences for all Singaporeans.
