<h3>In times of need, hassle-free access to government digital services can be critical. The Moments of Life (MOL) platform spearheaded by GovTech aims to allow seamless interaction among the Singapore government, businesses and citizens. Mr Dominic Chan, director, MOL, at GovTech, shares his thoughts about MOL’s future direction and potential.</h3>
<p>During critical turning points in life—whether you’re setting up a family,
a company, or caring for an ageing parent—transactions with the government
are often inevitable. In situations such as these, the less friction between
you and the government agency the better.</p>
<p>Digitalisation has been the metaphorical oil to the machinery of the Singapore
government, allowing more efficient and streamlined delivery of services
to businesses and citizens. Yet, digitalisation is not just about moving
processes online, but also about unifying multiple touchpoints into a single
coherent service journey. This is being achieved through the Moments of
Life (MOL) platform, spearheaded by the Government Technology Agency of
Singapore (GovTech).</p>
<p>“The government is often thought of as multiple agencies each doing very
different things. When businesses and citizens come to the government with
their needs, they may not know who to approach and where to go to solve
their problems,” said Mr Dominic Chan, director, MOL, at GovTech. “I personally
view MOL as a concierge, where we can help people along and make their
interactions with the government as seamless as possible.”</p>
<h3>Switching lanes</h3>
<p>Before joining GovTech, Mr Chan was senior vice president (operations)
in engineering services firm PCI Limited, where he was involved in improving
core business processes, reducing waste, boosting productivity, raising
quality and ensuring reliability - <a href="https://www.isixsigma.com/new-to-six-sigma/what-six-sigma/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lean Six Sigma</a> methodology
is often used.</p>
<p>“If you think about it, what we are doing [at GovTech] is re-engineering
government processes around businesses and citizens, so a lot of the skills
I acquired in the private sector remain relevant,” he explained. For instance,
his expertise in multi-stakeholder project and technology management comes
in handy when coordinating digitalisation plans among the various government
agencies that GovTech works with.</p>
<p>“From the service journey standpoint, there are definitely a lot of low-lying
fruits to improve the delivery of government digital services,” said Mr
Chan. “This is why when [Government Chief Digital Technology Officer] Cheow
Hoe shared with me the vision of MOL, I found it to be very inspiring and
meaningful, and was convinced to leave the private sector to join GovTech,”
he said.</p>
<h3>Licensed to make life easier</h3>
<p>Some of the low-lying fruits mentioned by Mr Chan are already being savoured
by the masses, in the form of the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-key-features-of-the-new-moments-of-life-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOL (Families)</a> mobile
app, launched in June 2018. Young couples with children under six years
old can now use the app to register new births, apply for the Baby Bonus
and track immunisation records on a single platform.</p>
<p>Going forward, Mr Chan highlighted that MOL will be expanded to provide
similar convenience in a variety of other contexts, for example, when setting
up or running a business. Before a company can operate in Singapore, it
must be registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority,
and the appropriate licenses and business permits must be obtained from
the respective government agencies. Figuring out these intricacies and
complying with them can be tricky and time-consuming.</p>
<p>“Having come from the private sector, I know that senior management is
always keen to ensure that the company’s activities are in full compliance
with government regulations. Hence, I think that the government can proactively
help businesses in this aspect,” said Mr Chan.</p>

<h3>A push in the right direction</h3>
<p>But does having a mobile app for each ‘Moment’ of life make sense? Mr
Chan has his reservations, noting that an individual may be going through
multiple ‘Moments’ simultaneously. “We cannot possibly expect someone to
download seven to ten apps in their phones just to access government digital
services,” he said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, swinging towards the other extreme of consolidating everything
on a single platform poses its own challenges. For one, the amount of information
on the platform could become overwhelming for users. To avoid some of the
issues that come with consolidation, Mr Chan thinks that a strategy of
timely nudges would work, something like the recommender systems on Netflix
or e-commerce sites.</p>
<p>“It is natural for the government to be able to at least categorise citizens
based on their age group, then identify triggering moments and perhaps
send a notification to them saying, ‘Hey, please check this out,’” he said.</p>
<p>The MOL approach could, therefore, be summed up as government digital
services delivered in a personalised, anticipatory fashion.</p>
<p>“I think if we continue to focus on how we can bring value to citizens
on a day-to-day basis, then people will talk about our products and use
them as a primary means of getting things done. That’s how we know we are
successful,” he concluded.</p>
