<p>The <a href="https://www.publicserviceweek.gov.sg/pstac-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Public Sector Transformation Awards Ceremony</a> on
10th July 2024 was a momentous occasion where public officers and agencies
were honoured for their exceptional contributions. It fills us with pride
to witness the dedication of our GovTechies, both as individuals and teams,
as they go above and beyond, collaborating closely with other agencies
to deliver impactful tech solutions for the public good.</p>
<p>Here's a glimpse of the remarkable projects that have earned well-deserved
recognition for their outstanding contributions. Congratulations to all
the award recipients for their exceptional service and contributions!</p>
<h3>Exemplary Innovator: LaunchPad</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/productivity-and-marketing/launchpad/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LaunchPad</a> is
a Whole-Of-Government innovation and experimentation platform that assists
public officers in brainstorming, experimenting with AI tools, and learning
about AI applications. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-sg/2024/04/25/govtechs-launchpad-ignites-ai-innovation-across-singapores-public-sector/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Since its inception</a>,
LaunchPad has garnered nearly 200,000 visits and facilitated over 36,000
conversations with AI, propelling numerous agencies forward in their digital
transformation journey.</p>
<p>Multiple prototypes have also originated from LaunchPad and its ecosystem.
One such prototype is Appraiser, a testimonial generator for teachers within
the Ministry of Education. What used to take an hour to draft is now reduced
to about 15 minutes, significantly decreasing the time taken for teachers
to compose students’ testimonials. This application has since benefited
over 4,000 teachers, with more than 40,000 testimonials generated to date.</p>

<h3>One Public Service Award: Case Connect (Referral &amp; Coordination)</h3>
<p><em>In collaboration with MSF, CPFB, HDB, ITE, MinLaw, MOE, MOH, MUIS, PA, SPS, and WSG</em>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/article/Building-Capabilities-Deepening-Partnerships-and-Leveraging-Technology-to-Strengthen-Social-Service-Delivery-" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Case Connect (Referral &amp; Coordination)</a> enables
case workers to seamlessly refer and coordinate a case plan on a common
IT platform. Before the launch of Case Connect in June 2021, there was
no standard platform for case workers to refer and coordinate cases across
Government and Non-Government agencies. Cases were typically managed manually
through email, text messages, or phone calls, and case outcomes were consolidated
manually. With Case Connect, case workers can now refer cases, share updates,
coordinate on a single case plan for clients, and track the case plan progress
on a single page, providing Comprehensive, Convenient, and Coordinated
(3C) support for clients.</p>

<h3>One Public Service Award: Project Cumulus </h3>
<p><em>In collaboration with AGD, PSD, and VITAL</em>
</p>
<p>Project Columbus was the first government public cloud project designed
to harmonise Finance, HR, and Payroll processes and practices across 41
Statutory Boards. This initiative facilitated the rapid adoption of best
practices and innovative services, yielding Whole-of-Government resource
efficiencies and streamlining the transition to shared services. Commencing
in July 2023, a monumental effort led to the onboarding of 41 statutory
boards with over 53,000 users onto a single-instance SaaS platform under
<a href="https://www.vital.gov.sg/media-library/videos/cumulus/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Platform Cumulus</a>– a groundbreaking Singapore Government public cloud
project.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>One Public Service Award: WOG Appeal System</h3>
<p>The team developed and launched the first-ever Whole-of-Government (WOG)
Appeal System, enabling Members of Parliament to appeal to lodge appeals
with agencies and access real-time outcomes. The system standardised the
upfront capture of necessary information and bolstered WOG citizen-sensing
capabilities to bridge policy-ops gaps.</p>
<p>The system was successfully launched on 13 June 2022, with 100% of agencies
managing MP appeals onboarded by July 2022. To date, the team has achieved
an impressive adoption rate of 90% among 92 MP divisions (including opposition)
for the system.</p>
