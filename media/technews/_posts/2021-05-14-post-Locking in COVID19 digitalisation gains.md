<p>We’ve all seen the meme by now: an innocuous enough multiple-choice question
about who led your organisation’s digital transformation. Your choices
are Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), and
– the punchline – Covid-19, of course!</p>

<p><em>It’s funny because it is true!</em>
</p>
<p>It’s funny because it’s true. But while the pandemic has triggered five
years’ worth of digital adoption in a matter of eight weeks (according
to a McKinsey study), organisations must now be proactive in ensuring these
changes are long-lasting, said GovTech Chief Executive Kok Ping Soon, who
kicked off the 25 March 2021 edition of the Stack X Webinar series, titled
“CIO Edition: Perspectives from the Public and Private Sector”.</p>
<p>He was joined by two other speakers: Ministry of Education CIO Tan Bee
Teck, who shared about shaping the classroom of the future through tech,
and Miriam McLemore, Director of Enterprise Strategy at Amazon Web Services,
who talked about her experiences helping different companies adopt new
agile practices and embrace cloud services.</p>
<p>After sharing the meme, Ping Soon emphasised the need to quickly seize
this unique moment. “As CIOs, you should lock in these gains and resist
the temptation to revert to old ways of doing things,” he said, adding
that there were three key shifts needed to achieve this.</p>
<h3>No to digital window-dressing?</h3>
<p>Firstly, entities should “avoid the temptation of applying a digital lipstick
to a legacy process”, he said, citing how diners at some restaurants are
now asked to scan a QR code for the menu instead of being handed physical
copies. However, often, the digital version turns out to be nothing more
than a PDF copy of the old menu, and diners still need to get the attention
of servers to take their orders.</p>
<p>“This is digitisation and not digitalisation,” Ping Soon said.</p>
<p>Today, 95 percent of government transactions can be completed digitally
from end-to-end and the government is aiming for complete digitalisation
of all services, he added. Some of these fully digital services include
the registering of a new-born and getting the accompanying baby bonus,
getting a business licence, and booking a COVID-19 vaccination appointment.</p>
<p>To support the private sector’s digital transformation, the government
has also opened its digital platforms to private companies. Hence, businesses
can use MyInfo to offer one-click registration and perform seamless, reliable
verification of customer details. Firms can also tap on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singpass-digital-signature-e-document-govtech-property-caveat-13469756" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sign with SingPass</a>&nbsp;to
allow their customers to sign digital documents.</p>
<h3>Get on the cloud</h3>
<p>Next, digitalisation efforts should leverage cloud and commercial solutions
that are already available. Such a strategy enabled the government to quickly
roll out Covid-19 digital solutions – the <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singpass-digital-signature-e-document-govtech-property-caveat-13469756" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Gov.sg</a> WhatsApp
Channel, TraceTogether, SafeEntry, GoWhere websites – by utilising existing
services from tech companies like Google and Amazon.</p>
<p>The government is also moving 70 per cent of its ICT systems to the commercial
cloud. One major advantage of this move is that different government agencies
can access a government-wide ecosystem of ready-made applications.</p>
<p>“Cloud has become the foundation that enables organisations to transform,
differentiate and gain a competitive advantage. Adopt a cloud-first strategy
in your digital transformation, or risk being left behind,” Ping Soon said.</p>
<h3>Keep digital at the core</h3>
<p>Finally, the pandemic has reshaped organisations’ views of their IT capabilities.
“CIOs and engineering teams are now uniquely positioned to influence not
just how business is done, but what should be done. Don’t lose this window
of opportunity,” he said.</p>
<p>Indeed, CIOs in the government “are now in the front seat” in driving
transformation and are “no longer order-takers at the end of a value chain”.
In the past, IT infrastructure was seen as a cost centre, and CIOs were
valued for their ability to keep costs down. Now, CIOs are expected to
demonstrate IT’s utility as a value driver by delivering transformational
growth. Hence, it is no longer enough to keep abreast of new technologies;
for starters, CIOs need to sharpen their communication skills and develop
good relationships with business leaders.</p>
<h3>Avoiding the pitfalls</h3>
<p>Along with these three opportunities, there are also three major risks
that must be handled well, Ping Soon shared.</p>
<p>One, cyber threats have the potential to deal with increasing damage as
Singapore deepens our reliance on tech, as demonstrated by the&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/solarwinds-hack-was-largest-and-most-sophisticated-attack-ever-microsoft" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SolarWinds</a>&nbsp;cyber attack, which affected 18,000 organisations,
including US government agencies and Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Two, data must be safeguarded and used responsibly so as not to erode
trust. Organisations must strengthen accountability for data handling and
privacy.</p>
<p>And three, third-party risks will arise when organisations seek outside
help to bridge skill gaps. They need to anticipate areas where reliability
and security may be compromised and come up with plans to mitigate these
issues.</p>
<h3>Never a better time for ICT</h3>
<p>In closing, Ping Soon said he believes there’s never been a better time
for those in the ICT industry. “The impetus for digital transformation
and the tangible benefits that can be derived has never been stronger and
plainer in sight. Let us not waste this opportunity to lock in the gains
of digitalisation while watching out for the risks. There’s certainly a
lot of work ahead for all of us, but I think the winds are behind our sails,”
he added.</p>
