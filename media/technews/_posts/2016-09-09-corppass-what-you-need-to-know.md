Here are some of the important details about how the [new CorpPass](https://www.tech.gov.sg/IDA.html), which offers a single corporate digital identity for Singapore businesses, works.

For the majority of businesses here, there will be two persons that will hold key roles in the CorpPass system: the registered officer and CorpPass administrator. 

The officer is the individual who is officially registered with an Unique Entity Number (UEN) Issuance Agency or is an appointed executive of the business, such as the chief executive officer or managing director. As such, there may be more than one registered officer within the business.

The officer can then appoint administrators, of which there can be a maximum of two, either by verifying and approving online or providing a letter of authorisation in a PDF through the CorpPass portal. 

Administrators can assign access to all digital government services to themselves. 

Later on, the administrator can create, assign and manage user accounts that allow employees to conduct government-to-business transactions with specific agencies.

In practice, this is how a small business will use CorpPass: Mr Ong, who owns a small food import business, employs a general manager, Harun, a finance manager, Juliet, and a human resources manager, Selva. 

Mr Ong, as the registered officer, appoints Harun as the CorpPass administrator. Harun then registers as an administrator and assigns himself access to all digital services, submitting a letter of authorisation on behalf of Mr Ong as part of the registration process. 

Once his status as administrator is approved, Harun can create CorpPass user accounts for Juliet and Selva. Juliet gets assigned access only to IRAS, while Selva gets assigned access only to the Ministry of Manpower’s digital services. 

Time for CorpPass
Through an agile, pilot phase approach, the CorpPass team in IDA has been testing the system for stability and making enhancements along the way.

Since the CorpPass trial which began in April this year, more than 1,500 business owners have successfully registered and activated their CorpPass accounts, said Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Assistant Chief Executive of IDA.

“We encourage businesses to sign up early for CorpPass, as this will be a required login method for most government digital services by the end of next year,” he added.
