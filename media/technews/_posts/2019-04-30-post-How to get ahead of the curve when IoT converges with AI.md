<h3>IoT devices collect vast amounts of data, making AI essential for sifting through the noise to produce actionable insights. Here are four points you should think about when developing or deploying an AI-IoT solution.</h3>
<p>Like unrefined gold ore, the raw data accumulated by millions of Internet
of Things (IoT) devices means nothing without some form of analysis—also
known as ‘data mining’. Rather than perform data mining manually, many
organisations are marrying IoT with artificial intelligence (AI), essentially
automating the process of distilling insights from what would otherwise
just be noisy information.</p>
<p>During a discussion titled ‘Where AI Meets Industrial IoT—Key Considerations
for Instrumenting &amp; Integrating Intelligence for Business’ at the IoT
Asia 2019 conference, a group of experts shared ideas on how to effectively
leverage AI and IoT to create value. We bring you four key takeaways from
the session.</p>
<h3>Putting AI on edge</h3>
<p>Typically, most IoT systems stream their data directly to the cloud, where
the computational infrastructure for analysis also resides. As more and
more devices come online, digital traffic becomes a problem.</p>
<p>“Because you are sending all the data [from sensors, for example] to the
cloud, you end up choking up the whole bandwidth of the system,” said Mr
Vishal Goyal, senior technical marketing manager for ASEAN, Australia,
New Zealand and India, STMicroelectronics. To avoid this issue, organisations
looking to implement IoT solutions should consider computing at the edge,
which could mean building AI into the IoT sensors themselves to process
the data collected there.</p>
<p>“As we bring AI down from the cloud to the devices, we are now only uploading
the meaningful information,” explained Mr Goyal. “This reduces the bandwidth
requirement, and not only does it make system implementation much easier,
but also more scalable since it is less likely to be overloaded when more
sensors are subsequently added.”</p>
<h3>Moving data faster</h3>
<p>Even though edge computing allows us to do more with the limited bandwidth,
we would still eventually require greater network connectivity, especially
for real-time decision making with IoT data, said Mr Damien Kopp, co-founder
of Envolve Data. “With the ‘data-fication’ of any form of process and business
comes the need to distribute and send the data collected, [and it] will
continue to put some pressure on the networks,” he noted.</p>
<p>This is where 5G wireless network infrastructure comes into play. Promising
higher bandwidth and almost negligible latency, 5G would allow even more
rapid and high-volume data transfer among devices, as well as between devices
and the cloud. South Korea and the US have already launched commercial
5G wireless networks, and a host of other nations are looking to follow
suit. Therefore, IoT solutions providers ought to make sure that their
devices are compatible with 5G when it becomes available.</p>
<h3>Finding the right fit</h3>
<p>Given the buzz around AI and IoT, one of the myths that have surfaced
is that such cutting-edge solutions are expensive. However, Mr Kopp noted
that fit-for-purpose systems could be developed at low cost and also made
available to small businesses—even to humble mom-and-pop shops.</p>
<p>For example, in the retail sector, one could obtain valuable data insights
with a system built for just US$120, Mr Kopp claimed. Such a system would
consist of a US$40 video camera to capture the movement of people (or product
sales) and the video data can then be analysed at the edge with publicly-available
software run on a Raspberry Pi mini-computer that only costs US$80. Therefore,
by defining a specific use case, organisations may be able to benefit from
AI and IoT without breaking the bank.</p>
