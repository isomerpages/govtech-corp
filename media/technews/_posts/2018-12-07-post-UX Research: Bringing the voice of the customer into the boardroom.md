<p>TL:DR: To deliver greater value to their customers, companies are increasingly
focused on improving user experience (UX). At the UXSEA Summit 2018, panelists
outlined their approaches to carrying out productive UX research. Keen
observation, researcher objectivity and team diversity will help businesses
put themselves in their customers’ shoes, said the panelists.</p>
<hr>
<p>Think about the last time you attempted to pour tomato ketchup from a
glass bottle. More likely than not, you gripped the bottleneck and smacked
the bottom of the bottle until the red viscous liquid splattered unceremoniously
onto your food. Had the ketchup been placed in a squeezable bottle instead,
your user experience (UX) of getting that dose of tomato-filled goodness
might have been more pleasant.</p>
<p>US food processing company Heinz learnt through its UX research that the
glass bottle was, in fact, an impediment to children obtaining ketchup
on their own. By producing an ‘EZ Squirt’ bottle, Heinz managed to raise
consumption of its ketchup by as much as 12 percent—an example of how companies
can profit by paying attention to how users interact with their products.</p>
<p>At the UXSEA Summit 2018, experts shared their insights into UX research
and its impact on the public and private sector. Moderated by Ms Priscilla
Nu, head of design at SP Group, the panel comprised Mr Khai Seng Hong,
head of UX design agency Foolproof’s Singapore office; Ms Soh Lishan, co-managing
director of design firm AGENCY; Mr Ramda Yanurzha, head of research at
ride-hailing platform Go-Jek; and Ms Samantha Yuen, design research lead
at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech).</p>

<h3>Watching and learning</h3>
<p>“UX research done well has the power to shape strategy. Our role [as UX
researchers] is to bring the voice of the customer to the boardroom,” said
Ms Soh.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done—to capture the diverse views and perspectives
of customers, the right research methodology must be applied. Asked about
their preferred approaches to UX research, the panelists described techniques
borrowed from ethnography—the systematic study of people and their behaviours,
habits and cultures.</p>
<p>Common to these techniques is the element of observation. For example,
to improve the usability of a ketchup bottle, UX researchers from Heinz
sat in on family meals to watch interactions among family members; they
concluded that children depended on their parents to obtain ketchup from
a glass bottle.</p>
<p>While aloof observation may work in some circumstances, a deeper understanding
of UX can be gleaned when the observer performs a task alongside research
participants, Mr Khai recommended.</p>
<p>“When you physically carry out the task [with participants] … it gives
you clues as to why your reality is different from the user’s reality,
and you can focus your curiosity on that,” he said.</p>
<h3>Going local</h3>
<p>Given Southeast Asia’s diversity, Ms Yuen highlighted two crucial ‘hacks’
to carry out good UX research—immerse yourself into the local culture,
and hire a good translator.</p>
<p>“How things are done in Indonesia is very different from how things are
done in Thailand, and so, it’s important to understand the culture of the
people you work with,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr Yanurzha agreed, adding that Go-Jek’s strategy when entering a new
market is to “hire the most local guy we can find”. Go-Jek also gets their
UX researchers to ply local roads.</p>
<p>For translation, Ms Yuen recommended hiring a simultaneous translator—someone
who can translate someone’s words or thoughts while the person is still
speaking. This will avoid any paraphrasing or summarising during translation,
which could affect the interpretation of research participants’ feedback.</p>
<p>Finally, the panelists emphasised the need to maintain objectivity during
UX research. The main hindrance to objectivity is the researchers’ own
biases and assumptions, said Mr Yanurzha, and these can be countered by
having diversity on the research team.</p>
<p>“For example, our team has architects, interactions designers, product
designers and engineers,” said Ms Soh. “The way [each member] processes
information is very different and can be very insightful.”</p>
