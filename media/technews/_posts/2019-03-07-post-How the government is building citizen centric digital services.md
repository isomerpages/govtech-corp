<h3>Digitalisation has paved the way for new business models and better ways of doing things. Mr Kok Ping Soon, chief executive of the Government Technology Agency of Singapore, explained the approach that the Singapore government is taking to create digital services.</h3>
<p>Prior to the invention of the internet, the time taken for technological
products to reach 50 million users was measured in the span of multiple
decades. It took 62 years for the number of car users to hit 50 million,
and even the now-ubiquitous television took 22 years to become part of
50 million households.</p>
<p>Since the World Wide Web came along in the 1990s, however, the pace of
technology adoption has accelerated. Within five years, PayPal had 50 million
people transacting on its platform. Twitter was even more impressive‚Äî50
million accounts were created in just two years. Along with these digital
innovations came the disruption of old business models and newer, more
efficient ways of doing things.</p>
<p>To avoid going the way of the dinosaur, both the private and public sector
have had to adapt to an increasingly digitalised global ecosystem, with
varying degrees of success. At the ‚ÄòInformation Technology Management Association
(ITMA) Dialogue with the CEO‚Äô held on 20 February 2019, Mr Kok Ping Soon,
chief executive of the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech),
described how the Singapore government has undergone major shifts in its
approach to digitalising its services for its citizens and businesses.</p>

<h3>Not just lip service</h3>
<p>‚ÄúDigitalisation is not just about taking a form, converting it into a
PDF and putting it online,‚Äù Mr Kok cautioned. Instead, it involves re-engineering
back-end IT infrastructure so that the form could be made redundant.</p>
<p>Such re-engineering is currently being undertaken by the Singapore government
and spearheaded by GovTech, resulting in the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/singapore-government-tech-stack/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Government Technology Stack (SGTS)</a>‚Äîa
common platform for hosting services, sharing data and building applications.
Whereas in the past, government IT architecture comprised monolithic systems
with ministry-specific applications, the SGTS has different modules, akin
to LEGO bricks, that can be pieced together to give rise to a variety of
different digital services.</p>
<p>Importantly, with the SGTS, data can be shared easily between ministries
when citizens grant their consent via MyInfo, a repository of government-verified
personal information, said Mr Kok. In this way, a re-imagined back-end
IT system has drastically reduced the need to fill in forms when transacting
online.</p>

<h3>Ahead in the cloud</h3>
<p>Mr Kok also highlighted that the Singapore government is looking to tap
on the commercial cloud to develop digital services. Partnering with leading
providers of commercial cloud services will grant organisations access
to the latest innovations in the information and communications technology
sector.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have our Government Data Centre for confidential systems‚Ä¶ [but] in
our own estimate, more than 70 per cent of government IT systems can be
hosted on the commercial cloud‚Äîwith the right classification,‚Äù he said,
adding that functions classified as ‚Äòrestricted‚Äô and below will be offloaded
to the cloud.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given the current climate of rampant hacking, Mr Kok urged
IT managers to always ask: is your IT architecture designed with security
in mind? While commercial cloud providers do have robust cybersecurity
measures in place, they should not be taken for granted when developing
digital services.</p>
<h3>Putting people first</h3>
<p>Finally, referencing the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-blueprint/?utm_source=top_nav" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Government Blueprint</a> that
was published in June 2018, Mr Kok reiterated the importance of ‚Äúserving
with heart‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is where the primacy of citizens‚Äô needs overwrites the sovereignty
of an agency,‚Äù he noted. Rather than just develop a policy, then provide
specifications for an IT system to translate the policy to operations,
GovTech seeks to engage with citizens in the development process, iterating
on an outcome based on their requests and feedback.</p>
<p>Citing the Moments of Life (Families) mobile app that was launched last
year, Mr Kok explained, ‚ÄúPeople say they want a dashboard, okay; we put
in a dashboard. People say they want to search for healthcare institutions
based on whether they qualify for some government scheme, okay; we will
continue to enrich [the app].‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe're still figuring things out, but we're taking a step in the right
direction,‚Äù Mr Kok concluded.</p>
