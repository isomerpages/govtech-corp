<p>Scam messages. We've all received them.</p>
<p>But how can you tell if they're legitimate? The editorial team at TechNews
pulled up some text messages from our inboxes to highlight what's not quite
right with them.</p>
<h3>Exhibit 1: The delivery delay</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Example of how a scam message can look like" src="/images/technews/Exhibit_1.jpg">
</div>
<h4>Red flag #1: It says Singapore Post instead of SingPost</h4>
<p>Scammers often try to use generic names like "info" or "msginfo" in their
emails and messages. 'Singapore Post' is a little bit more generic than
'SingPost' which is used in their everyday communications – so there's
some reason to be suspicious.</p>
<p>That said, even if 'SingPost' was used, there is no guarantee that the
message is authentic.</p>
<p><em>PS: If you look carefully, 'Reminder' is also spelt as 'Remindaer'!&nbsp; Spelling errors are also another warning sign.</em>
</p>
<h4>Red flag #2: It contains a link!</h4>
<p>Also, as of Feb 28 2022, SingPost (as well as banks in Singapore) have
stopped sending clickable links in their official SMSes. This one is suspicious
for sure.</p>
<p>But even if SingPost did indeed send clickable links, the message contains
a shortened URL, which has absolutely nothing to do with SingPost (<a href="http://www.singpost.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.singpost.com</u></a>).</p>
<p>Why is that a red flag? Messages with shortened URLs claiming to address
delivery issues often lead to phishing sites designed to steal your personal
information.</p>
<h4>Red flag #3: The number has a +63</h4>
<p>For starters, +63 is the country code for the Philippines, so that should
be an immediate red flag. That said, +65 (Singapore's country codes) aren't
much better either; they should not be trusted, especially if it's from
an unknown number.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>PS: Unfortunately, scammers can also spoof a legitimate sender's number and email address, so you always have to be wary, regardless where the message is from.</em>
</p>
<h3>Exhibit 2: The traffic fine</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Example of a fake traffic fine message issued by scammers" src="/images/technews/TechNews_scam_article_traffic.png">
</div>
<h4>Red flag #4: Dodgy website link</h4>
<p>'police-gov.com' is a big red flag; You'd expect the police to have at
least <strong>'gov.sg'</strong> in the url. At least, the official one (
<a href="http://www.police.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.police.gov.sg</a>) does.</p>
<p>This website may also look legitimate with the logo, but scammers have
been known to create good replicas of the real thing.</p>
<p><em>PS: Another way to avoid getting scammed is to wait for the official letter from the Traffic Police to see if you have indeed gotten a fine. Alternatively, you can file an appeal <a href="https://eddies.police.gov.sg/eappeal/xhtml/itrust/TrafficOffenseAppealAltLogin.xhtml" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, with your appeal number; they'd be able to advise if it's legitimate or not.</em>
</p>
<h4>Red flag #5: Unexpected payment requests</h4>
<p>If you're transacting with the Government, you usually will have to use
your Singpass to log in to the website. Always be sceptical when this doesn't
happen. The fact that PayNow also isn't offered as a payment option is
a red flag.</p>
<p>Stay alert to any unexpected requests for payments or fees, particularly
if they say that payments are urgent or overdue.</p>
<p>Also, rest assured, the Singapore Government will give you ample time
and notice to pay your fines.</p>
<h3>Exhibit 3: The fake bank officer</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Example of fake bank officer impersonation by scammers" src="/images/technews/Exhibit_3_edited.jpg">
</div>
<h4>Red flag #6: You're instructed to download an app</h4>
<p>If you're asked to download an app, there's a very high chance that the
app is malware designed to steal your information.</p>
<p>This holds particularly true if it's a third-party app not found on official
app stores such as Google Play or Apple App Store.</p>
<p>In the past, scammers have tricked Singaporeans to download malware in
the form of apps on the promise of good deals involving <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/e-commerce-scams-food-items-s20000-seafood-durian-wagyu-beef-3328556" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">durians, wagyu beef</a>,
and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/online-mooncake-scam-27-people-lose-325000-in-a-month" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mooncakes</a>.</p>
<p>Remember – even if the app sounds like a trustable app, you need to download
it via original sources. In 2023, there was a scam that made people download
a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-warn-against-new-phishing-scam-variant-involving-fake-scamshield-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fake ScamShield app</a> outside
the Google Play store.</p>
<h3>Exhibit 4: The helpful customer service staff</h3>
<p></p>

</div>
<h4>Red flag #7: Requesting sensitive information</h4>
<p>Last but not least, always remember that someone requesting your One-Time
Password (OTP) or personal passwords is a major security red flag. And
yes, your Singpass credentials fall into this category; since a lot of
your sensitive information can be assessed using it.</p>
<p>Such requests are often signs of attempted fraud or hacking, as legitimate
companies and services will never ask for this sensitive information via
unsolicited communications. Protecting your personal data is crucial; thus,
it's important to stay vigilant and cautious. Always verify the identity
of the person or entity asking for such details and never share your passwords
or OTPs over phone calls, emails, or messages that you did not initiate
or cannot independently verify.</p>
<h3>How can we stay safe, then?</h3>
<p>Scams are getting increasingly sophisticated every day. And they're getting
better and better at impersonating companies and the authorities.</p>
<p>That being said, the first line of defence you can identify a legitimate
link from the Singapore Government is to look for <strong>'gov.sg'</strong> in
the URL. In the past, some government sites did not all use <strong>'gov.sg'</strong>,
but this is changing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way is to look out for <strong>'go.gov.sg', 'for.sg' or 'for.edu,sg'</strong> in
the url. These shortened links can only be created by public servants,
healthcare and education officers respectively, so you can be assured that
they are legitimate.</p>
<p>For a slightly more manual process, you can also check links you receive
against the <a href="https://www.gov.sg/trusted-sites" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>list of trusted websites</u></a> here;
if they claim to be from government or government affiliated websites.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the best thing you can probably do is to
stay informed. In the age of the internet; scammers are the new robbers
and thieves. Learn about the characteristics of common scams and keep updated
with the latest scam tactics in your region to avoid falling victim.</p>
<p>Stay alert, stay safe.</p>
