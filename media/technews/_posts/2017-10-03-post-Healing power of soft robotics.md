<p>When 50-year-old Madam Lim experienced a stroke in January this year,
the movement of the right side of her body became impaired.</p>
<p>She was hospitalised for three months, during which she underwent an intense
rehabilitation regime that involved numerous physiotherapy sessions.</p>
<p>Upon her discharge, she was advised to continue these prescribed exercises
at home with the help of a caregiver and family members. Frequent visits
back to the hospital were required to monitor her progress.</p>
<p>As the silver tsunami hits Singapore, a growing proportion of our population
will, like Madam Lim, experience some form of age-related ailment that
compromises mobility.</p>
<p>As recovery is a long process, the strain on healthcare resources is expected
to increase exponentially, with demand for occupational therapists and
physiotherapists outpacing supply.</p>
<p>Thanks to researchers from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS)
Department of Biomedical Engineering, help is at hand — in the form of
robotic devices that are making their way into clinics and hospitals.</p>
<p>Although robots have more commonly been deployed in industrial settings
such as manufacturing, recent advances in technology have made them more
compact and consumer-friendly, and hence better able to move beyond the
assembly line into other domains such as healthcare.</p>
<p>On 20 July 2017, the Institute of Engineers Singapore (IES) conferred
IES Prestigious Engineering Achievement Awards on two NUS <a href="http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/EILab/robotics.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">inventions</a> —
a soft robotic glove (EsoGlove) and a soft robotic sock (SRS) for physical
rehabilitation — in recognition of their innovative use of technology and
potential to improve quality of life.</p>
<p>NUS Assistant Professor Raye Yeow, who leads both projects, spoke to TechNews
about how soft robotics is fast becoming part of the biomedical scene of
the future.</p>
<h3><strong>Engineering soft hardware</strong></h3>
<p>Robots are often thought of as cold, hard machines with metal joints and
rigid movements.</p>
<p>Yet, the robotics being built by Professor Yeow’s team are soft and pliable
— the EsoGlove and the SRS both employ soft pneumatic actuators which are,
in essence, elastic materials with variable stiffness along their lengths,
through which air is pumped to generate movement.</p>
<p>The EsoGlove helps patients with hand motor impairments to perform at-home
rehabilitation and day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>The SRS, meanwhile, is targeted at bedridden patients who are at high
risk of deep vein thrombosis and ankle joint contractures due to prolonged
immobility; the sock assists them with ankle exercises that promote blood
flow and ankle mobility.</p>
<p>“Using low-pressure pneumatics, the EsoGlove can provide finger flexion
and extension assistance. A similar technology is used in the SRS which
can provide both pull-and-push assistance on the foot to facilitate ankle
exercise," said Professor Yeow.</p>
<p>He added that compared with conventional robotics, soft robotics are lightweight,
easily customisable to mimic the natural range of movements of human joints
and inexpensive to produce.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge the teams faced in developing the two soft robotics
devices was in meeting the special clinical needs of stroke patients, said
Professor Yeow.</p>
<p>For example, given that such patients tend to have contracted, stiff joints,
glove and sock had to be both wearable and functionally safe.</p>
<p>“We designed the glove and sock to make it easy for patients to don independently
or with help from a caregiver. The actuators also need to be capable of
providing adequate forces to move the fingers and feet while ensuring comfort
and safety,” said Professor Yeow.</p>
<h3><strong>A helping hand and a leg up</strong></h3>
<p>As with all biomedical devices, the EsoGlove and SRS are undergoing extensive
tests before the they are widely deployed in hospitals and clinics.</p>
<p>Professor Yeow is working with senior consultant Dr Lim Jeong Hoon, a
rehabilitation clinician at the National University Hospital (NUH), to
testbed the devices in a clinical trial. The feedback from patients and
caregivers has so far been positive.</p>
<p>“Our users have commented that the devices are useful, with great ease
of operation and a good comfort level. They are satisfied with our invention
and have indicated a strong desire to use them regularly,” said Professor
Yeow.</p>
<p>Given these encouraging results, Professor Yeow shared that an NUS startup,
Roceso Technologies, has been established to commercialise both inventions
and integrate them into home care and healthcare systems.</p>
<p>As Singapore’s first soft robotics company, <a href="https://www.roceso.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Roceso Technologies</a> hopes to demonstrate
that robots can not only synergise with the functions of healthcare workers,
but also help patients recover more quickly by making rehabilitation tasks
more convenient and accessible.</p>
<p>“Robotics is necessary to raise the productivity of the healthcare workforce
so that they can now manage more patients at any one time,” said Professor
Yeow, who is also the scientific adviser to Roceso Technologies.</p>
<p>“Robotics will also enable patients to optimise their therapy time, thereby
speeding up their recovery process, potentially saving treatment-related
costs and time. The quality of life of patients can be greatly improved
through robot-assisted tasks.”</p>
<p>“The IES Prestigious Engineering Achievement Awards have given us strong
recognition of our teams’ efforts in developing soft wearable robotics.
We are motivated to pursue our soft robotics engineering research further
and develop novel wearable technologies to improve healthcare,” he added.</p>
