<p>At SFF x SWITCH 2019, a panel of experts discussed how blockchain could
be used to enable everything from digital identity to cross-border trade
in the context of a smart nation.</p>
<p>Better known as the technology underlying Bitcoin transactions, blockchain
is coming into its own with numerous applications emerging across a wide
swathe of industry sectors. Serving as a permanent and tamper-resistant
digital record of interactions among multiple parties, blockchain promises
to overhaul the way companies transact with one another. It comes as no
surprise, then, that even government agencies are looking at blockchain
technology as a means to coordinate inter-agency efforts and perform cross-border
operations.</p>
<p>At the Singapore FinTech Festival and the Singapore Week of Innovation
and Technology (SFF x SWITCH), leaders from the tech industry and the public
sector convened to discuss ‚ÄòSingapore‚Äôs Push Towards a Smart Nation‚ÄîHow
Government and Corporates Can Collaborate to Drive Blockchain innovation‚Äô.</p>
<p>Sharing their insights were Mr Carsten Sapia, group IT and head of the
Asia-Pacific region at BMW Group Asia; Mr. Vinay Mohan, managing director
at ConsenSys Singapore; Mr Randeep Sudan, board advisor at Ecosystem; Mr
Steven Koh, director of the Government Digital Services division at the
Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech); and Mr Carl Wegner,
managing director and head of Asia at R3. Moderating the discussion was
Ms Veronica Tan, director of next-generation platforms at the Infocomm
Media Development Authority of Singapore.</p>
<h3>Fostering a spirit of innovation</h3>
<p>Just as seeds require the right combination of factors to grow, blockchain
innovation needs the right environment to flourish. In Mr Mohan‚Äôs opinion,
Singapore, in her push towards becoming a smart nation, has created the
‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù for emerging technologies such as blockchain to be tested,
deployed and scaled.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat Singapore has to offer, in one simple word, is an ecosystem. It
has very fertile foundations and support from all the different sides of
the landscape: supportive government, forward-looking policies, regulatory
certainty, as well as support from the private sector,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Of the many potential blockchain applications that could help governments
achieve their smart nation goals, digital identity has surfaced as a priority
use case. ‚ÄúUnless you have digitised identification of individuals, it
is very difficult to provide personalised services,‚Äù Mr Singh explained,
noting that in addition to better customer satisfaction arising from personalisation
of services, the immutable nature of blockchain makes it possible to prevent
identity theft or fraud.</p>
<p>Apart from digital identification, Mr. Singh also highlighted that a lot
of work is going on in terms of using blockchain to facilitate data markets.
Many countries, such as China, Australia and the US, are now setting up
platforms for digitising and exchanging information.</p>
<h3>Overcoming challenges together</h3>
<p>Yet another potential application of blockchain technology is in the realm
of smart mobility, where autonomous vehicle manufacturers, traffic management
system vendors and transport authorities will need to coordinate their
efforts to ensure the safety of driverless cars on roads.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlso, if you think about a mobility ecosystem in a smart city like Singapore,
it involves a lot of exchange of data. It requires [all players in the
mobility space] to identify not only passengers and pedestrians, but also
various modes of transportation available and the types of vehicles used,‚Äù
said Mr Sapia.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology could well be the lynchpin for all this data exchange
among multiple stakeholders, said Mr Wegner. ‚ÄúBlockchain is a team sport.
The more players [there are operating on a blockchain], the more effective
it is,‚Äù he quipped.</p>
<h3>Unlocking new opportunities</h3>
<p>If implemented correctly, blockchain-based projects can have a much larger
impact than initially anticipated, Mr Koh added. He highlighted OpenCerts,
a blockchain-based platform used to digitise and verify educational credentials,
which was developed as a collaborative project between GovTech and the
Ministry of Education of Singapore.</p>
<p>Eighteen institutions in Singapore are already using the platform, but
what surprised Mr Koh was that foreign institutions also began adopting
OpenCerts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll notice that the University of Lithuania already uses
it. We also have local startups like Accredify, Next ID, and even a Canadian
company called Convergence using OpenCerts,‚Äù he revealed.</p>
<p>OpenCerts also lay the foundation for TradeTrust, another blockchain-based
platform for the exchange of digital trade documents, which will enhance
security, pre-empt fraud, as well as reduce cost of documentation, said
Mr Koh.</p>
<p>And these are just the tip of the iceberg of blockchain applications.
Mr Mohan noted that by taking a step back and looking at blockchain technology
from a broader perspective, one will realise that at its heart, ‚Äúblockchain
is a very inclusive technology. It is for everyone, not just for people
who are at the fringes‚Äîit‚Äôs also for governments, enterprises and the man
or woman on the street.‚Äù</p>
