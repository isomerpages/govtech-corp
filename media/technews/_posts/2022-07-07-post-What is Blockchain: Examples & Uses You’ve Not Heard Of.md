<p><em>Blockchain is more than just crypto.</em>
</p>
<h3>What is blockchain technology</h3>
<p>Blockchain technology is a distributed, immutable ledger that records
transactions across many computers. Essentially, it's a digital record
that's shared and synchronised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, governments and organisations worldwide use blockchain for many
applications, from supply chain management to digital identity verification.
Locally, as part of Singapore's <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/our-enhanced-smart-nation-vision-paving-the-way-for-a-new-digital-era/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Smart Nation</u></a> initiative,
blockchain is used to enhance the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/our-digital-government-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>digitalisation of public services</u></a> while
ensuring transparency and security.</p>
<h3>How blockchain works</h3>
<p>Blockchain operates through a computer network that validates and records
transactions in "blocks." These blocks are then cryptographically linked
together, forming a "chain." Each block contains a timestamp and a link
to the previous block, creating an immutable record.</p>
<p>When a transaction occurs, it's broadcast to the network, verified by
multiple computers, and added to a new block. This block is then added
to the chain, making it permanent and transparent. This structure ensures
that no single entity controls the data, and any attempt to alter it would
be easily detectable.</p>
<p>What it is, in simple terms, is a shared dairy kept among a group of friends.
Every time someone writes an entry, it's copied and distributed to everyone
else. Each entry is numbered and linked to the previous one, so no one
can erase or change past entries without everyone noticing.</p>
<h4>Key takeaways</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distributed and immutable ledger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transactions are recorded in linked "blocks."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verified by multiple computers for accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparent and secure, with no central control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timestamps and links create an unalterable history.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits of blockchain</h3>
<p>Now that you understand what blockchain is and how it works, you might
wonder why it's so widely used. Blockchain offers numerous benefits, making
it applicable across various sectors.</p>
<p>For example, Singapore has embraced blockchain technology, positioning
itself as a hub for innovation and fintech in Southeast Asia. Government
initiatives like the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Fintech Regulatory
Sandbox and other blockchain-friendly policies support this growth. The
use cases and adoption of blockchain are not only increasing within Singapore
but also gaining significant traction on a global scale, transforming industries
and government services worldwide.</p>
<h4>More than just crypto</h4>
<p>For many, blockchain is synonymous with cryptocurrency because you always
hear about it in the same breath. Blockchain is basically what makes crypto
tick.</p>
<p>Whether you think cryptocurrency is the future of money or the biggest
bubble since the tulip mania, we can all agree that news about crypto is
seemingly inescapable. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/18/technology/terra-luna-cryptocurrency-do-kwon.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>The Terra/Luna crash</u></a>,
warnings about <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/retail-investors-should-steer-clear-of-cryptocurrencies-singapore-to-approach-tech-with-open-mind-dpm-heng" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>the riskiness of crypto trading</u></a>,
and even countries adopting Bitcoin as legal tender — these are just some
examples of how crypto is everywhere and how blockchain is shaping our
everyday lives.</p>
<p>However, if you look beyond cryptocurrency's headline-grabbing element,
you’ll find that blockchain has a much broader range of potential applications.
Today, blockchain is used in various industries, offering secure, decentralised
solutions for a wide range of applications.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Coordinating aid for millions</h4>
<p>When a crisis hits, assistance — food, shelter and other necessities —
usually flows in from different organisations whose efforts overlap. However,
inefficient aid distribution during humanitarian crises is a serious issue.
That’s because multiple organisations often assist the same people with
food, health, shelter, and protection, using differing systems and processes.</p>
<p>In these situations, blockchain offers a unique opportunity to coordinate
these efforts, improving efficiency and transparency.</p>
<p>One great example is Building Blocks, a blockchain network that enables
collaboration and real-time information sharing in an environment where
all members have equal say and responsibilities. Organisations can coordinate
humanitarian action and improve efficiency and impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enables people to receive different types of assistance from multiple
humanitarian organisations in one “go”, reducing the complexity of accessing
humanitarian support. At the same time, no sensitive information, such
as names or dates of birth, is stored to ensure the privacy and security
of the people served.</p>
<p>Over US$325 million worth of aid has been distributed using this network,
benefitting more than a million people a month. This helps build pathways
to peace, stability, and prosperity for those recovering from conflict,
disasters, and the impact of climate change.</p>
<h4>Tracking vehicle emissions across Europe</h4>
<p>With the growing effects of climate change, reducing the environmental
impact of motor transport has become all the more pressing. A current stumbling
block is the inability to gauge vehicle carbon emissions accurately because
a standardised measure cannot be implemented across borders and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, the European Commission partnered with MOBI, a technology
provider for internet-connected vehicles, to test a blockchain solution
for the European Union’s 280 million vehicles across 27 states.</p>
<p>The pilot found that sharing vehicle information, such as fuel consumption
or emissions, to a blockchain system is feasible. Such data will empower
officials and other stakeholders to come up with policies and incentives
to reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles.</p>
<h4>Verifying registered business information in Singapore</h4>
<p>All business dealings come with due diligence that has to be done on potential
partners. As such, a trusted repository of information on companies is
needed. However, over 75,000 Business Profiles and Business certificates
are issued by ACRA each month, creating a need for accurate, up-to-date,
and fraud-proof business records. And blockchain technology is ideal for
tackling this challenge.</p>
<p>The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) <a href="https://govinsider.asia/vision/how-singapore-is-simplifying-business-with-blockchain-acra/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>TrustBar platform</u></a> enables
the public, including would-be investors, to verify information like a
company’s name, directors, and office address. You can check business profiles,
registration certificates, and incorporation certificates.</p>
<p>This information is kept on the blockchain, allowing it to be checked
in real time and making tampering or inaccuracies very unlikely.</p>
<h4>Validation of COVID vaccination</h4>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>As the world began opening up post-pandemic, travelling required quite
a few medical documents, such as COVID vaccination status, swab results,
and other certificates.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>HealthCerts — developed by GovTech in collaboration with the Ministry
of Health — uses blockchain technology to provide verifiable and tamper-proof
digital health documents.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Travellers could upload their digital documents and, upon successful authentication
and endorsement, receive a digital certificate containing a QR code. These
digital certs were recognised by overseas immigration checkpoints. This
streamlined travel and enhanced security, making the resumption of mass
travel much smoother.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><strong>H3 Earning rewards by setting up data hotspots</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Our final example touches on crypto, but not in the world of speculation
on the financial markets that we are familiar with. Instead, it’s about
creating public, long-range wireless coverage for Internet of Things (IoT)
devices.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>These devices are interconnected physical objects embedded with sensors,
software, and other technologies for connecting and exchanging data over
the Internet. Some IoT devices you might be familiar with are wearable
fitness trackers, smart lighting systems, and smart pet collars.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>This is being done through a project called the Helium Network. Helium
is a wireless data network that encourages the public to set up so-called
“Helium hotspots” that share their internet connectivity. When you do this,
Helium rewards you with its own cryptocurrency. The more people connect
to and use your hotspot, the more crypto you get.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The company is striving to spread internet connectivity and enable more
devices to be connected as the Internet of Things becomes increasingly
common.&nbsp; Today, the Helium ecosystem and its hundreds of thousands
of Hotspots deployed by a global community provide access to the largest
decentralised wireless network in the world. This enables wider access
to IoT connectivity, and all these functions are enabled by blockchain
technology.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>H2 Blockchain is just getting started</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Blockchain technology’s versatility and power are evident in its diverse
use cases, locally and globally. Its importance lies in its ability to
enhance security, transparency, and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Whatever the use case for blockchain right now, one thing is for certain
— things are just getting off the ground, and there will likely be future
uses that no one has thought of today.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>After all, when regular folks first started connecting to the Internet,
it was hard to imagine things like social media and online gaming. Yet
here we are today. So, it’s definitely wise to stay updated on how blockchain
technology evolves and impacts our lives.</p>

and even&nbsp;countries adopting Bitcoin&nbsp;as legal tender – these are
just some examples of how crypto is everywhere.</p>
<p>Look beyond the headline-grabbing element of cryptocurrency, however,
and you’ll find an underlying technology that holds greater potential than
simply digital currency – blockchain.</p>
<p>Indeed, deeper exploration will reveal that blockchain technology has
been powering several impactful applications that unfortunately haven’t
been met with the same level of interest as crypto.</p>

<p>So even if you’re (rightfully) cautious about the whole hype about cryptocurrency,
it’ll still be wise to keep your eyes on the development of blockchain
technology.</p>
