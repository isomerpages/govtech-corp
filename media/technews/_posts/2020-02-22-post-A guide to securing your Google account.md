<h3>Keeping personal information private and staying safe online need not be difficult. Here‚Äôs how you can configure your Google account settings to make your browsing more secure.</h3>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre sending an email, shopping online or driving in unfamiliar
territory, the odds are you‚Äôre tapping on Google‚Äôs incredibly diverse range
of web services to get things done. Gmail, Google Search, Google Maps and
more have become so integral to most people‚Äôs lives that one‚Äôs Google account
is like a passport to the digital world.</p>
<p>Now imagine losing that passport or having it hijacked by some malicious
actor to perform shady activities online. That would certainly make for
an unpleasant experience. Rather than go through the hassle of recovering
a compromised account, why not prevent a breach in the first place? Here‚Äôs
how to make sure that you are completely in control of your Google account.</p>
<h3>Run a security checkup</h3>
<p>This is something that Google recommends doing at least once a year (though
it doesn‚Äôt hurt to do it more regularly). While signed in to your Google
account on your browser, key in this URL: <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup</a>
</p>
<p>On this page, you‚Äôll be presented with an overview of your account‚Äôs security,
with various settings and features to adjust, like:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sign-in &amp; recovery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your devices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recent security events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third-party access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Password checkup</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Sign-in &amp; recovery</h3>
<p>This tab prompts you to set up a range of methods to verify your account.
Google can use these to confirm your identity and rule out suspicious activity.
For example, you can provide Google with a phone number for two-factor
authentication or input an alternate email address for Google to send you
confidential information in the event you need to recover a compromised
account (also useful when you‚Äôve forgotten your password and need to reset
it).</p>
<h3>2. Your devices</h3>
<p>According to Statista, there are 6.58 network-connected devices per person
around the globe. This can make it difficult to keep track of which devices
are linked to your Google account. Under the ‚ÄòYour devices‚Äô tab, you‚Äôll
find a consolidated list of all the devices that you‚Äôre currently signed
in to. You can immediately sign out from any unrecognised devices on that
list. Google will also encourage you to change your password if there are
unrecognised devices registered with your account and will sign you out
of all devices except the one you‚Äôre using to initiate the change in password.</p>
<h3>3. Recent security events</h3>
<p>Sometimes, no news is good news, so you should feel relieved if you don‚Äôt
see any incident reports under this tab. Google runs its own security scans
in the background and will notify you if it detects unusual security events,
such as a sign-in from a new device or changes to a sensitive account setting.
For example, if you updated your recovery email address based on the above
instructions, expect to receive an email informing you of the change.</p>
<h3>4. Third-party access</h3>
<p>For convenience, many of us link third-party apps to our Google accounts.
Under this ‚ÄòThird-party access‚Äô tab, you‚Äôll be able to view the entire
list of apps and sites with access to your information via Google. From
here, you can check what permissions have been granted to each app and
when those were granted. For instance, if you have the ActiveSG app installed,
it can see and add to your Google Fit physical activity, speed and distance
data. Also, if you no longer use a particular third-party app, consider
removing its access to your Google account to reduce security risks.</p>
<h3>5. Password checkup</h3>
<p>Weak passwords are one of the foremost reasons internet accounts get compromised.
Google recommends that your password should contain at least eight characters,
with a combination of numbers, letters and symbols, and it shouldn‚Äôt contain
personal information and commonly used words. Using Google‚Äôs ‚ÄòPassword
checkup‚Äô function, you can check your saved passwords for security issues,
including whether you have reused them across multiple accounts.</p>
<p>With these tips, hopefully, you‚Äôll find that staying safe online isn‚Äôt
difficult‚Äîall it takes is a little bit of effort to configure your account
settings properly.</p>
