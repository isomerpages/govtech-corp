<h3>TL:DR: Facebook is taking steps to improve its services and better protect its users. Artificial intelligence (AI) is key to these upgrades to the social media platform. We also highlight 5 tips to secure your Facebook account and control how your data is used.</h3>
<p>“Move fast and break things” might have been a suitable mantra for a fledgling
social media company seeking to connect people across the globe with technology.
But as Facebook has discovered, things like trust, once broken, can be
difficult to piece together again.</p>
<p>With the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the furore over alleged election
interference still fresh in the minds of the general public, Facebook has
been scrambling to assure its consumer base that it is taking steps to
improve its platform and keep its users safe. One technology that Facebook
is leaning heavily on is artificial intelligence (AI), said Dr Norberto
Andrade, privacy and public policy manager at Facebook.</p>
<p>“Facebook is all about giving people the power to build community and
to bring the world closer together… AI is deeply connected to that mission,”
noted Dr Andrade, speaking at the EmTech Asia 2019 conference held from
21-23 January at the Marina Bay Sands Expo &amp; Convention Centre.</p>

<h3>AI @ Facebook</h3>
<p>Given the massive number of Facebook users and their interactions on the
social media platform, manual policing of undesirable or suspicious online
activity is unfeasible in the long run.</p>
<p>This is where AI is being used to monitor and flag violations to community
standards, including content relating to graphic violence, adult nudity
and sexual activity, terrorist propaganda, hate speech, spam and fake accounts,
Dr Andrade explained.</p>
<p>“To give you an example, in the third quarter of 2018, we removed three
million pieces of terrorist propaganda, and 99.5 per cent of that content
was actually flagged and identified through our AI system before any user
on Facebook actually reported it,” he said.</p>
<p>Facebook is also investing heavily in AI research to address “important
issues surrounding AI, such as fairness, privacy, safety and transparency,”
which could eventually result in greater user protection on the platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Facebook is using AI to become more inclusive. Natural language
processing, a subfield of AI, is helping to automatically generate translations
for Facebook posts. For the visually handicapped, AI-assisted computer
vision is enabling what Dr Andrade calls “organic alternative texts”, recognizing
and identifying objects, concepts and actions in photos and feeds to produce
an audio description.</p>
<p>Winding down the discussion, Dr Andrade emphasised that AI development
at Facebook is a cross-functional process, involving programmers, privacy
advocates, data scientists, academics and other influential stakeholders.
Diverse teams are also crucial for avoiding and mitigating biases in AI
systems, he added.</p>
<p>“There's a shift in the company to look and take our time in assessing
the broader implications of our products… So it's not always about moving
fast… [we want people to] understand that we are a company that is invested
in ethics,” Dr Andrade concluded.</p>
<h3>Build your own Facebook rule book</h3>
<p>If you’re an AI sceptic and prefer a more hands-on approach to safety
and privacy on Facebook, here are 5 settings you should pay attention to.</p>
<p><em>1. Facebook permissions</em>
</p>
<p>More than 95 per cent of Facebook users worldwide use the social media
platform via their smartphones. When downloading the mobile app, you may
have granted Facebook access to your smartphone’s camera, calendar, microphone
and GPS, among other functions. To change these settings, press and hold
the app icon &gt; select ‘App info’ &gt; select ‘Permissions’ &gt; uncheck
permissions that are not relevant to you.</p>
<p><em>2. Third-party apps</em>
</p>
<p>For convenience, many third-party applications allow you to log in using
your Facebook account. This grants the third-party app developer access
to information such as your user ID and preferences. However, if you no
longer use those apps, it may be wise to de-link your Facebook account
from them. It’s easier to do this on your desktop or laptop browser: go
to ‘Settings’ &gt; select ‘Apps and websites’ &gt; select applications
to remove.</p>
<p><em>3. Ad settings</em>
</p>
<p>Facebook’s AI is also used to send targeted advertisements to users. Should
you find some ads annoying rather than helpful, click on the ‘Ads’ tab
within Facebook settings on your desktop or laptop browser. You can then
adjust your ad preferences, including your interests, and previous advertisers
you’ve interacted with, and even decide whether Facebook can send you ads
based on sites you visit off-Facebook.</p>
<p><em>4. Notifications on unauthorized login</em>
</p>
<p>We’ve all received that odd message from a friend whose Facebook account
has been hacked. For that to happen, the impersonator would have had to
log in from another device or location. To be immediately alerted about
an unauthorised login to your Facebook account, head to the ‘Security and
login’ tab within Facebook settings and turn on notifications for logins
from devices or browsers you don’t usually use.</p>
<p><em>5. Set up two-factor authentication</em>
</p>
<p>This final measure should apply to most if not all your online interactions.
Wherever two-factor (2FA) or multi-factor authentication methods are available,
enable them. Turn this function on in the ‘Security and login’ tab within
Facebook settings and select from two different 2FA methods.</p>
