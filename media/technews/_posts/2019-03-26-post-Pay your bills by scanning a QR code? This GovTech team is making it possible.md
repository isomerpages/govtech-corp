<p>The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the need for contactless experiences.
That in turn led to the surge of QR code adoption, even though these little
black squares have been around since 1994. Today, <a href="https://business.yougov.com/content/42931-qr-codes-are-they-set-stay-course-time" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>74 per cent of Singaporeans</u></a> share
that they use QR codes more often post pandemic. Also, <a href="https://www.visa.com.sg/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases/card-payments-overtake-cash-usage-in-singapore-visa-study.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>48 per cent of Singaporeans now use QR codes to make payments</u></a>,
enjoying great convenience when purchasing their favourite Old Chang Kee
curry puff or checking out their groceries.</p>

<p>Inspired to replicate this experience for government-related transactions,
GovTech introduced Government QR Payment (Gov QR Payment). Secure yet seamless,
it allows citizens to simply scan the QR codes on their bills, both physical
and electronic, to make payments. This effort marks a step towards achieving
the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-government-blueprint/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Digital Government Blueprint’s</u></a> goal
of delivering end-to-end digital services for citizens that make transactions
more convenient and digital payments easier to use.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at its development and use cases!</p>
<h3>1. Getting the Process Started</h3>
<p>Gov QR Payment is based on the Singapore QR (SGQR) code standard developed
by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which defines QR code details such
as the default positions for Singapore-relevant fields, as well as the
ordering of account information from payment schemes.</p>
<p>However, instead of creating a separate mobile app for the Gov QR Payment,
the team at GovTech decided to integrate their solution with the banks’
e-payments apps with QR scanning features. This involved working closely
with financial institutions including DBS Bank, OCBC Bank, United Overseas
Bank and electronic payment service provider NETS.</p>
<p>“For example, we had to carry out user acceptance testing and pre-live
testing of the Gov QR Payment system with the financial institutions,”
said the Gov QR Payment team. “Sometimes, we discover a bug in the bank’s
app which even the bank’s developers may not be aware of, and they will
fix it to ensure that there is no hiccup when rolling out the Gov QR Payment
function within their app.”</p>
<h3>2. Pilot Testing with HDB</h3>
<p>Once the technical framework had been put in place, the Gov QR Payment
team carried out a pilot test on the Housing Development Board (HDB) Resale
Portal and Sales e-Application in August 2018.</p>
<p>Resale flat buyers and sellers could pay for resale application administrative
fees, conveyance fees and title search fees using the Gov QR Payment system,
thereby eliminating the need for buyers and sellers to make payment personally
at HDB if they do not have a credit card. For those applying to buy apartments
from HDB, the S$10 administrative fee can be paid via QR payment as well.
To date, more than 10,000 individuals have used the Gov QR Payment system
to transact with the Government.</p>
<h3>3. Where we are today</h3>
<p>Given the early success of HDB, other government agencies such as the
Central Provident Fund (CPF), the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the
Land Transport Authority (LTA) have since deployed Gov QR Payment as an
e-payment mode. “The Gov QR Payment option is in line with the Singapore
government’s Digital Government Blueprint, and is a step towards delivering
end-to-end digital services for citizens by 2023,” said the Gov QR Payment
team.</p>
<p>While Gov QR Payment is designed to be safe and secure, you should always
be vigilant when using digital services. Make sure the QR codes you're
about to scan are from credible and trusted sources, so that you don't
fall prey to scams and malicious activities.</p>
