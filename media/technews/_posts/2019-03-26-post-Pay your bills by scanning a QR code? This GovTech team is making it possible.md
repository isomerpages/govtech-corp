<h3>QR codes are a straightforward method to make digital payments. Citizens can now use the Government QR Payment system to transact with HDB, CPF, SLA and LTA.</h3>
<p>What‚Äôs worse than having to foot a bill? A cumbersome payment process
requiring the payer to verify personal particulars, fill in bill reference
numbers, key in the amount payable, or set up a GIRO account from which
the payment can be deducted.</p>
<p>Rather than make clients go through a hassle when parting with their money,
organisations are turning to digital technologies to streamline payments,
and one of the most popular electronic payment (e-payment) methods to date
has been the quick response (QR) code. Easy to identify and simple to use,
these black-and-white (or purple with PayNow), squarish and two-dimensional
barcodes automatically redirect users to a payment webpage once scanned
with a mobile phone camera.</p>
<p>Leveraging this technology, the Singapore government is looking to implement
QR code-based payments across its agencies. ‚ÄúThe Government QR Payment
(Gov QR Payment) system, which was developed by the Government Technology
Agency of Singapore (GovTech), allows citizens to simply scan the QR code
on their bills, both physical and electronic, to transact with the government,‚Äù
said the Gov QR Payment team at GovTech.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Banking on convenience</strong>
</p>
<p>Gov QR Payment is based on the Singapore QR (SGQR) code standard developed
by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which defines QR code details such
as the default positions for Singapore-relevant fields, as well as the
ordering of account information from payment schemes.</p>
<p>However, instead of creating a separate mobile app for the Gov QR Payment,
the team at GovTech decided to integrate their solution with the banks‚Äô
e-payment apps with QR scanning features. This involved working closely
with financial institutions including DBS Bank, OCBC Bank, United Overseas
Bank and electronic payment service provider NETS.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor example, we had to carry out user acceptance testing and pre-live
testing of the Gov QR Payment system with the financial institutions,‚Äù
said the Gov QR Payment team. ‚ÄúSometimes, we discover a bug in the bank‚Äôs
app which even the bank‚Äôs developers may not be aware of, and they will
fix it to ensure that there is no hiccup when rolling out the Gov QR Payment
function within their app.‚Äù
<br>
</p>
<h3>A step in the right direction</h3>
<p>Once the technical framework had been put in place, the Gov QR Payment
team carried out a pilot test on the Housing Development Board (HDB) Resale
Portal and Sales e-Application in August 2018.</p>
<p>Resale flat buyers and sellers could pay for resale application administrative
fees, conveyance fees and title search fees using the Gov QR Payment system,
thereby eliminating the need for buyers and sellers to make payment personally
at HDB if they do not have a credit card. For those applying to buy apartments
from HDB, the S$10 administrative fee can be paid via QR payment as well.
To date, more than 10,000 individuals have used the Gov QR Payment system
to transact with the Government.</p>
<p>Given the early success of HDB, other government agencies such as the
Central Provident Fund (CPF), the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the
Land Transport Authority (LTA) have since deployed Gov QR Payment as an
e-payment mode. ‚ÄúThe Gov QR Payment option is in line with the Singapore
government‚Äôs Digital Government Blueprint, and is a step towards delivering
end-to-end digital services for citizens by 2023,‚Äù said the Gov QR Payment
team.

<h3>QR code best practices</h3>
<p>Having tested and developed numerous QR codes, the Gov QR Payment team
knows how to avoid encountering an error message when scanning QR codes
for payment.</p>
<p>Here are five tips you should note.</p>
<p><strong>1. Scan head-on</strong>
</p>
<p>When scanning a QR code, make sure you get a complete ‚Äòfront view‚Äô image
by positioning your camera so that it directly faces the QR code. A scanning
angle of less than 30 degrees will likely result in failure to process
a transaction.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>2. Tap to focus</strong>
</p>
<p>Most smartphone cameras these days come with built-in auto-focus, but
it helps to tap once on the screen while in camera mode to make sure that
the QR code comes into focus before snapping a photo.</p>
<p><strong>3. Capture all three corners</strong>
</p>
<p>The squares at the top two and bottom-left corners of the QR code are
there for a purpose‚Äîto help the scanner align the image such that it knows
top from bottom, left from right, so make sure all three corners are in
the frame while scanning.</p>

<p><strong>4. Don‚Äôt crumple or deface the QR code</strong>
</p>
<p>The pattern on the QR code is important, so crumpling or drawing on it
can prevent the scanner from recognising it.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>5. Verify payment details</strong>
</p>
<p>Always check that the transaction details are correct before sending payment.
For bills from government agencies, the Gov QR Payment code should automatically
indicate the amount to be paid and the bill reference number. For merchant
transactions, be sure that the store name matches what is displayed after
the QR code has been scanned.</p>
