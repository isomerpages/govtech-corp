<p>In this year‚Äôs budget, PM Lawrence Wong described Artificial Intelligence
(AI) not just as ChatGPT or Large Language Models, but rather as a key
technology of the future ‚Äì comparing it to technological breakthroughs
such as the electricity, or the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>That said, it‚Äôs understandable that one might nurse fears that AI might
replace you at the workplace someday. A survey by Microsoft last year showed
that two-thirds of Singaporeans are afraid that they‚Äôll lose their jobs
due to AI.</p>
<p>So if you‚Äôre feeling anxious about AI, harness that energy and learn about
how the tech works and what it can do for you. After all, you don‚Äôt fear
what you understand.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some tips to empower yourself with AI knowledge:</strong>

<h3>1. Don‚Äôt knock it till you‚Äôve tried it</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs been more than a year since generative AI took the world by storm,
so if you still haven‚Äôt tried it yet, it‚Äôs time to come up from whatever
rock you‚Äôve been living under.</p>
<p>Chatbots and image generators are the main generative AI tools available
for free now, so make sure you use both of them.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve got past the initial aimless exploration, challenge yourself
to use them in your everyday life. Whether it‚Äôs creating a packing list
and itinerary for your upcoming holiday, or producing sketches and pictures
to go with your work presentation, this gets you to start seeing AI as
a tool you can use, instead of an amorphous, malignant force.</p>
<p>If you have difficulty getting exactly what you want or even something
close to it, you‚Äôll know why <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/prompt-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>prompt engineering</u></a> is
such a buzz phrase now. Getting good at getting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/technology/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-prompts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>good results from AI</u></a> is
a sought-after skill nowadays, so you‚Äôre already getting future-ready!</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve heard of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-hallucination-chatbots-chatgpt-falsehoods-ac4672c5b06e6f91050aa46ee731bcf4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>AI hallucinating</u></a> and
making things up, why not try it out yourself and see if you can break
the chatbot you‚Äôre using? At the very least, you‚Äôll quickly learn about
the limitations of the chatbot you‚Äôre using when it starts giving ever
less useful replies. And hopefully, you also realise you need to double-check
information from chatbots and not end up like a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/nyregion/lawyer-chatgpt-sanctions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>certain lawyer</u></a> who
cited legal cases that turned out to be entirely fabricated by a chatbot.</p>
<h3>2. Read up on how AI actually works</h3>
<p>Now that you‚Äôve tried your hand at generative AI tools, it‚Äôs time to gain
some understanding of what‚Äôs going on under the hood.</p>
<p>Yes, AI researchers are typically PhD holders, but there are many good
articles such as this one that explain AI using plain English. You‚Äôll not
only gain an overall understanding of AI but also other terms such as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&amp;list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>machine learning</u>
</a>and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>natural language processing</u></a>,
concepts that are critical to the inner workings of chatbots.</p>
<p>Be sure to sign up for updates from the links above so that you regularly
read about the latest developments and trends in AI. If you‚Äôre reading
this, you probably already know that GovTech‚Äôs very own <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>TechNews</u></a> page
is a handy source of informative articles on AI and all things tech! And
of course, along the way, you‚Äôll discover other useful resources of your
own.</p>
<h3>3. Discover how AI projects are pulled off</h3>
<p>Now that you‚Äôve done some homework, you have the requisite knowledge to
read up on how AI projects are done. This will acquaint you with the necessary
ingredients for a successful AI tool (typically, lots of data) and the
stages and processes involved.</p>
<p>For instance, you can check out TechNews‚Äô articles on using AI to <a href="/media/technews/clearing-the-air-using-tech-to-keep-our-environment-smoke-free/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>detect smoking</u></a> at
public parks, or how AI can <a href="/media/technews/how-ai-and-a-camera-phone-help-keep-food-on-our-tables/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>identify healthy fish feed</u></a> for
farming.</p>
<p>There is also the <a href="https://medium.com/dsaid-govtech" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Medium page</u></a> of the Data
Science and Artificial Intelligence Division, which dives deeper into topics
like <a href="https://medium.com/dsaid-govtech/productionising-large-language-models-in-government-0fbf3909311b" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>large language models</u></a>.</p>
<p>Besides GovTech pages, other organisations also share outlines of how
they use AI in their daily operations, such as <a href="https://open.nytimes.com/how-the-new-york-times-uses-machine-learning-to-make-its-paywall-smarter-e5771d5f46f8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>improving paywalls</u></a>.
These articles are also typically written with a mix of technical and everyday
language, so they stretch your understanding without completely losing
you.</p>
<h3>4. Join communities with an interest in AI and tech</h3>
<p>Remember how we used to form study groups to mug together, motivating
each other to stay the course when we were kids? Being part of communities
that are interested in tech and AI provides the same benefits.</p>
<p>For instance, DataScience SG frequently posts about the latest AI developments
and engaging discussions on various related topics. You can also check
out GovTech‚Äôs community of tech experts, <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/communities/stack-x-meetups/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>STACK</u></a>,
to expand your network. Such communities also have information about industry
talks, workshops, and events that will sustain your interest and expand
your horizons.</p>
<h3>5. Get certified in AI</h3>
<p>This sounds intimidating, but there are actually baby steps you can take
towards finally earning some industry-recognised qualifications.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>MySkillsFuture</u></a> has
a wealth of courses on AI for your pick, ranging from general introductory
courses to how AI can be applied to different sectors like finance and
marketing.</p>
<p>For those who have done their homework and are ready to make a leap into
a new industry, AI Singapore‚Äôs AI Apprenticeship Programme is an intense
scheme with a two-month AI-engineering learning phase followed by seven
to 10 months of on-the-job training. Those who complete the programme are
then ready to become AI professionals.</p>
<h3>Tech just keeps rolling on</h3>
<p>OpenAI announced its <a href="https://openai.com/sora" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>latest product</u></a> in mid-February,
an AI model that can generate cinema-quality video from text prompts. Given
the speed at which AI is advancing, there‚Äôs no telling which aspect of
life and work it will touch next.</p>
<p>Will AI wipe out jobs on a massive scale? The jury is still out on this
one (although our AI overlords may read this in the not-so-distant future
and laugh at the naivety of humanity).</p>
<p>What is more certain is that AI is already changing how humans do their
jobs. Even if AI doesn‚Äôt replace you, a person who knows how to use AI
tools might very well do so.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: it‚Äôs time to get smarter about AI and take steps
towards boosting your own intelligence.</p>
