<p>At the Government Technology Agency (GovTech), developers are far from
the typical image of workers hunched over computers, typing lines of code
all day.</p>
<p>Instead, they do plenty of stand-up and mingling, says software engineer
Hoon Ding Yi, whose role is to implement features and solve technical challenges.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have cards tagged with the ongoing tasks pasted on the walls, and
every morning we gather for a team stand-up,‚Äù says Ding Yi. During this
stand-up session, team members run through their tasks and update their
progress with the rest of the team.</p>
<p>They also do ‚Äúpair programming‚Äù ‚Äì each task is assigned two developers
who share ideas and sometimes have ‚Äúintense‚Äù discussions before a single
line of code is written‚Äù, Ding Yi says.</p>
<p>That written code gets reviewed by the end of the day by team members.
This rapid and involved way of working is part of the agile methodology
used to develop the Moments of Life (Families) app.</p>
<p>Here are five key features of the new Moments of Life (Families) app.</p>
<h3>A more agile way of working</h3>
<p>Many public agencies had to work together on the Moments of Life (Families)
project. Besides GovTech, there was the Public Service Division (PSD),
Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Early Childhood Development
Agency (ECDA), Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and Health
Promotion Board (HPB).</p>
<p>In the past, each agency would work with third-party vendors, write detailed
specification papers at the start and only check in with their vendors
at designated times and milestones, Ding Yi explains.</p>
<p>But with the agile methodology, the agencies involved in Moments of Life
(Families) were ‚Äúsyncing up‚Äù with GovTech almost every other week, he says.
The agile methodology requires several rounds of quick iterations to develop
a system or app.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo the agencies definitely had to be more engaged than with other projects,‚Äù
Ding Yi says, but it helped that ‚Äúthey were very receptive to changes.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Using government-built software</h3>
<p>For the Moments of Life (Families) app, Ding Yi and his team used two
technologies developed in-house at GovTech.</p>
<p>The first, the Next-Generation Container Architecture or NECTAR, is a
platform providing the benefits and flexibility of cloud services, but
with reduced security and operational concerns, and greater compliance
with GovTech requirements.</p>
<p>The second system, called Application Programming Interface Exchange (APEX),
allows GovTech‚Äôs systems to easily ‚Äútalk‚Äù or exchange information with
the digital systems of other public agencies.</p>
<p>Both resources are part of the Singapore Government Tech Stack. As the
Tech Stack was newly introduced when the Moments of Life (Families) app
was being built, many agencies had to enhance their systems to connect
to the Tech Stack.</p>

</div>
<p>But with APEX making it easier to link various systems together, says
Ms Lee May Gee, Director, Moments of Life (Families) Programme Office,
the agencies were supportive and able to quickly upgrade their systems
to match.</p>
<p>Their support, along with using shared government digital resources and
the agile methodology, kept the Moments of Life (Families) project on schedule.
The app was launched within a year ‚Äì and ‚Äúwithout any major hiccups‚Äù, adds
Ding Yi.</p>
<h3>Shaping team culture</h3>
<p>Another aspect of the agile methodology GovTech uses is collective code
ownership. This means everyone works on every part of the system, and tasks
are assigned to team members with a range of experience and expertise.</p>
<p>An advantage is that whenever something goes wrong in the app, each team
member is able to troubleshoot it, fix it, or find the correct person to
help.</p>
<p>Along the way, Ding Yi has found that using the right processes helps
to shape a team‚Äôs culture to be more proactive. That then shapes the quality
of the product, one that is less prone to error.</p>
<p>He adds: ‚ÄúI used to think of systems, especially software systems, as
autonomous. This Moments of Life (Families) project has made me realise
how wrong I was. Software systems are a direct reflection of the team that
built it.‚Äù</p>
