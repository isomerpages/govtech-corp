<p>TL:DR: Despite the country’s high population density, many Singaporeans
remain strangers even to their immediate neighbours. Mobile crowdsourcing
apps such as HelpBuddy could promote active citizenry and increase volunteerism
within communities. From sharing household items with your neighbours to
helping them find lost pet dogs, find out how you can help others in your
neighbourhood via your mobile phone.</p>
<hr>
<p>With one of the highest population densities in the world, Singapore packs
nearly 8,000 people into every square kilometre of its limited land mass.
Yet, for people who live in such close proximity, it’s unfortunate that
neighbours in housing estates here often remain perfect strangers.</p>
<p>Things weren’t always this way. In the 1960s, nearly three-quarters of
Singaporeans lived in ‘kampungs’, or small rural villages. Within these
enclaves, neighbours knew one another intimately and shared whatever limited
resources they had, creating what became known as the ‘kampung spirit’—a
sense of community which infused every aspect of daily living. As Singapore
progressed, however, this cohesiveness appears to have dissipated.</p>
<p>Seeking to revive the kampung spirit, researchers at Singapore Management
University (SMU), working with the Municipal Services Office (MSO), have
developed and released a mobile crowdsourcing app called HelpBuddy for
beta trial.</p>
<h3>Many hands make light work</h3>
<p>Originally, HelpBuddy was designed as an app to mobilise communities to
take charge of their living environment. When SMU first started working
on HelpBuddy with MSO, the vision was more about promoting active citizenry
with a focus on Government-to-Citizen related tasks such as the checking
of state land and the condition of heritage markers, said Professor Archan
Misra of SMU. He was speaking at the InnoLeap X TRANS Grant sharing day
on 26 October 2018, which brought together researchers, government agencies
and the industry to learn about the projects and opportunities made possible
by the TRANS Grant funding initiative.</p>
<p>Government agencies would put up location-specific tasks on the app, and
citizens in the area could choose to perform those tasks voluntarily. This
eyes-on-the-ground strategy served to augment public agencies’ limited
manpower resources, since volunteers were now providing proactive feedback
on the status of different aspects of their living environment. The volunteers
could also feel a sense of achievement when the app eventually notified
them about how agencies reacted to their feedback.</p>
<p>But the HelpBuddy developers soon had a better idea. Rather than only
allowing government agencies to list tasks on the app, why not let citizens
do the same and seek help from their neighbours? Hence, the Citizen-to-Citizen
section of the app was born, serving as a tool for neighbours to connect
with one another. “That builds community spirit, which was not what we
had explicitly intended when we started on this journey,” said Professor
Misra.</p>

<h3>Three ways to help</h3>
<p>For the beta trial, the project team developed three types of Citizen-to-Citizen
tasks that can be posted and fulfilled on HelpBuddy. The first type encourages
the sharing of items. Instead of buying household appliances or tools that
may be used only occasionally, citizens can borrow them from people within
their community. This not only saves money, but also encourages more frequent
interaction among neighbours.</p>
<p>The second type of task involves crowdsourcing for voluntary medical escorts
who can accompany elderly citizens to their medical appointments.</p>
<p>“We want to see how volunteers within the neighbourhood can be pooled
together to help people with specific needs, such as the elderly,” said
Mr Mohamed Hardi, Deputy Director, Programmes Division at MSO, who works
closely with Professor Misra’s team on HelpBuddy.</p>
<p>Finally, dog owners will be happy to know that HelpBuddy allows mobile
crowdsourcing to recruit a neighbourhood’s residents to help search for
their missing pet dogs. “We may be extending it to cats in the future.
We don’t look for tarantulas and snakes, though,” Mr Hardi joked.</p>
<h3>The return of the <em>kampung </em>spirit?</h3>
<p>If all goes well, the various functions of HelpBuddy would eventually
be integrated with MSO’s existing OneService App.</p>
<p>This will allow users of HelpBuddy to leverage OneService App’s 150,000
users for a broader reach and more successful task fulfilment. With the
right use of technology, the kampung spirit may yet return to Singapore’s
neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>“These mobile crowdsourcing capabilities serve not only the Smart Nation
agenda, but also the desire to improve volunteerism in our communities,”
Mr Hardi concluded.</p>
<h3>About TRANS Grant</h3>
<p>This work is funded under the Translational R&amp;D Initiative (TRANS
Grant), which taps on the research community to solve public sector challenges
with innovative use of digital technology. This funding initiative is in
support of Singapore’s Smart Nation and Digital Government drive, and is
jointly managed by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech)
and the National Research Foundation (NRF).</p>
