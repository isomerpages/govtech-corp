<h3>More than just crypto</h3>
<p>Whether you think cryptocurrency is the future of money or the biggest
bubble since the tulip mania, we can all agree that news about crypto is
seemingly inescapable.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/18/technology/terra-luna-cryptocurrency-do-kwon.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Terra/Luna crash</a>,
warnings about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/retail-investors-should-steer-clear-of-cryptocurrencies-singapore-to-approach-tech-with-open-mind-dpm-heng" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the riskiness of crypto trading</a>,
and even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61248809" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">countries adopting Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;as
legal tender ‚Äì these are just some examples of how crypto is everywhere.</p>
<p>Look beyond the headline-grabbing element of cryptocurrency, however,
and you‚Äôll find an underlying technology that holds greater potential than
simply digital currency ‚Äì blockchain.</p>
<p>Indeed, deeper exploration will reveal that blockchain technology has
been powering several impactful applications that unfortunately haven‚Äôt
been met with the same level of interest as crypto.</p>
<h3>Coordinating aid for millions</h3>
<p>When a crisis hits, assistance ‚Äì food, shelter and other necessities ‚Äì
usually flows in from different organisations whose efforts overlap.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mUgbPq66GXQu6p8aSxH6x1W6cw71tFCB80cQyQvIILE/edit" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Building Blocks</a>,
a blockchain network, enables collaboration and real-time information sharing
in an environment where all members have equal say and responsibilities.
Organisations are able to coordinate humanitarian action and improve efficiency
and impact.</p>
<p>Over US$325 million worth of aid has been distributed using the network,
benefitting more than a million people a month.</p>
<h3>Tracking vehicle emissions across Europe</h3>
<p>With the growing effects of climate change, reducing the environmental
impact of motor transport has become all the more pressing. A current stumbling
block is the inability to gauge vehicle carbon emissions accurately because
a standardised measure cannot be implemented across borders and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, the European Commission partnered with MOBI, a technology
provider for internet-connected vehicles, to&nbsp;<a href="https://dlt.mobi/eupilot/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">test a blockchain solution</a>&nbsp;for
the European Union‚Äôs 280 million vehicles across 27 states.</p>
<p>The pilot found that sharing vehicle information, such as fuel consumption
or emissions, to a blockchain system is feasible. Such data will empower
officials and other stakeholders to come up with policies and incentives
to reduce the carbon footprint of vehicles.</p>
<h3>Verifying registered business information in Singapore</h3>
<p>All business dealings come with due diligence that has to be done on potential
partners. As such, a trusted repository of information on companies is
needed.</p>
<p>The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)&nbsp;<a href="https://govinsider.asia/vision/how-singapore-is-simplifying-business-with-blockchain-acra/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TrustBar platform</a>&nbsp;enables
the public, including would-be investors, to verify information like a
company‚Äôs name, directors, and office address.</p>
<p>This information is kept on the blockchain, allowing it to be checked
in real-time and making tampering or inaccuracies very unlikely.</p>
<h3>Validation of COVID vaccination</h3>
<p>Travelling nowadays requires quite a few medical documents such as COVID
vaccination status, swab results, and other certificates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/healthcerts/overview.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HealthCerts</a>&nbsp;‚Äì
developed by GovTech in collaboration with the Ministry of Health ‚Äì uses
blockchain technology to provide verifiable and tamper-proof digital health
documents.</p>
<p>Travellers can upload their digital documents and upon successful authentication
and endorsement, will receive a digital certificate containing a QR code.
These digital certs are recognised by overseas immigration checkpoints.</p>
<h3>Livestock identification in South Africa</h3>
<p>How do you know if the food you‚Äôre eating really comes from its purported
source and really passed its safety tests?</p>
<p><a href="https://beefledgersa.com/#beef-supply" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BeefLedger</a>, a blockchain
project in South Africa, seeks to address concerns of food fraud and safety
concerns. Besides providing a platform for consumers to validate beef products‚Äô
credentials, it also enables all parties to access the same information,
levelling the informational playing field. The over 22,000 beef cattle
producers across South Africa hope such transparency and adherence to public
standards will build trust in their products and help in their push to
break into new markets.</p>
<h3>Crypto beyond speculation ‚Äì rewarding the setting up of data hotspots</h3>
<p>Our final example touches crypto, but not in the world of speculation
on the financial markets that we are familiar with.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Helium</a>&nbsp;is
a wireless data network that encourages the public to set up so-called
‚ÄúHelium hotspots‚Äù that share their internet connectivity. When you do this,
Helium rewards you with its own cryptocurrency. The more people connect
to and use your hotspot, the more crypto you get.</p>
<p>The company is striving to spread internet connectivity and enable more
devices to be connected as the Internet of Things becomes increasingly
common.</p>
<h3>Blockchain is just getting started</h3>
<p>Whatever the use case for blockchain right now, one thing is for certain
‚Äì things are just getting off the ground and there will likely be future
uses that no one has thought of today.</p>
<p>After all, when regular folks first started connecting to the internet,
it was hard to imagine things like social media and online gaming. Yet
here we are today.</p>
<h4>So even if you‚Äôre (rightfully) cautious about the whole hype about cryptocurrency, it‚Äôll still be wise to keep your eyes on the development of blockchain technology.</h4>
