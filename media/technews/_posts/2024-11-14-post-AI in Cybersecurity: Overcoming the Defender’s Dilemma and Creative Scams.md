<p>The complexity of cybersecurity grows as the digital world continues to
evolve. Hackers are becoming more creative, sophisticated scams are on
the rise, and with the integration of AI into these malicious tactics,
cybersecurity experts face an uphill challenge. But there’s hope. <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/5-ai-terms-to-boost-your-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> is
increasingly seen as a powerful ally in cybersecurity, providing defenders
with the tools to detect, analyse, and disrupt potential threats. Hence,
GovTech’s Anti-Scam Products (GASP) team has <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">adopted AI</a> to
level the playing field in this ever-evolving battle. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markchen-sg/?originalSubdomain=sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Mark Chen</a>,
Principal Product Manager at GASP, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-nhy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Andre Ng</a>, Assistant
Director at GASP, will share more about how the GASP team uses AI to overcome
the Defender’s Dilemma.</p>
