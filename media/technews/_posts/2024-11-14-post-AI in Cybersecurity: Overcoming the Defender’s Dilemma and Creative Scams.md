<p>The complexity of cybersecurity grows as the digital world continues to
evolve. Hackers are becoming more creative, sophisticated scams are on
the rise, and with the integration of AI into these malicious tactics,
cybersecurity experts face an uphill challenge. But there’s hope. <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/5-ai-terms-to-boost-your-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> is
increasingly seen as a powerful ally in cybersecurity, providing defenders
with the tools to detect, analyse, and disrupt potential threats. Hence,
GovTech’s Anti-Scam Products (GASP) team has <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">adopted AI</a> to
level the playing field in this ever-evolving battle. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markchen-sg/?originalSubdomain=sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Mark Chen</a>,
Principal Product Manager at GASP, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-nhy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Andre Ng</a>, Assistant
Director at GASP, will share more about how the GASP team uses AI to overcome
the Defender’s Dilemma.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into how AI is changing the face of cybersecurity and what
this means for both defenders and attackers in this high-stakes game.</p>

<h3>The Defender’s Dilemma in Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>In today’s digital age, cybersecurity is a relentless battle. While defenders
work tirelessly to safeguard systems from countless threats, attackers
only need to find one vulnerability to strike. This is the essence of the <em>Defender’s Dilemma</em>.
It highlights the difficult position cybersecurity professionals face:
they must defend every aspect of a system, while cybercriminals can focus
all their efforts on identifying and exploiting a single weak point.</p>

<div class="isomer-card-title">What is the Defender’s Dilemma?</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">The defender's dilemma in cybersecurity refers to the notion that defenders
must protect against all possible attacks by addressing all vulnerabilities,
while attackers only need to find one vulnerability in the system to succeed.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>According to Google’s report on How AI Can Reverse the Defender’s Dilemma,
there are 3 main factors that contribute to this issue:</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>1. The internet was built for sharing information but not for the security of data</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Security was not a primary focus when the internet's original technology
stack was developed. Furthermore, key protocols did not prioritise security
features such as identity and authentication. While there have been attempts
to improve on this, changes happen slowly, and there is also the risk of
fracturing compatibility with older systems.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>2. The digital world is growing more complicated every year</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The internet's design lets different technologies work together, but new
risks emerge as software becomes more complex. Developers add layers to
simplify this complexity, but these layers can create security gaps or
vulnerabilities. As our digital world expands, the security risks increase,
especially with AI enabling more software creation and management.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>3. The lack of cybersecurity expertise and resources to combat attackers</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Attackers have significant advantages over defenders, who are stretched
thin across the digital ecosystem. While defenders must protect against
many threats, attackers can focus on a single target, exploiting vulnerabilities
and waiting for mistakes. Small businesses are especially vulnerable as
they may lack the resources and expertise to defend against determined
attackers.</p>
