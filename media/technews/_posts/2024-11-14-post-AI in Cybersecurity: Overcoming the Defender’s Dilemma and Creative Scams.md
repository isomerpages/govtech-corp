<p>The complexity of cybersecurity grows as the digital world continues to
evolve. Hackers are becoming more creative, sophisticated scams are on
the rise, and with the integration of AI into these malicious tactics,
cybersecurity experts face an uphill challenge. But there’s hope. <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/5-ai-terms-to-boost-your-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> is
increasingly seen as a powerful ally in cybersecurity, providing defenders
with the tools to detect, analyse, and disrupt potential threats.</p>
<p>GovTech’s Anti-Scam Products (GASP) team has <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">adopted AI</a> to
level the playing field in this ever-evolving battle. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markchen-sg/?originalSubdomain=sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Mark Chen</a>,
Principal Product Manager at GASP, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-nhy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Andre Ng</a>, Assistant
Director at GASP, will share more about how the GASP team uses AI to overcome
the Defender’s Dilemma.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into how AI is changing the face of cybersecurity and what
this means for both defenders and attackers in this high-stakes game:</p>

<h3>The Defender’s Dilemma in Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>In today’s digital age, cybersecurity is a relentless battle. While defenders
work tirelessly to safeguard systems from countless threats, attackers
only need to find one vulnerability to strike. This is the essence of the <strong>Defender’s Dilemma</strong>.
It highlights the difficult position cybersecurity professionals face:
they must defend every aspect of a system, while cybercriminals can focus
all their efforts on identifying and exploiting a single weak point.</p>
<div class="isomer-card-grid">

<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">What is the Defender’s Dilemma?</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">The defender's dilemma in cybersecurity refers to the notion that defenders
must protect against all possible attacks by addressing all vulnerabilities,
while attackers only need to find one vulnerability in the system to succeed.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>According to Google’s report on How AI Can Reverse the Defender’s Dilemma,
there are 3 main factors that contribute to this issue:</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>1. The internet was built for sharing information but not for the security of data</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Security was not a primary focus when the internet's original technology
stack was developed. Furthermore, key protocols did not prioritise security
features such as identity and authentication. While there have been attempts
to improve on this, changes happen slowly, and there is also the risk of
fracturing compatibility with older systems.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>2. The digital world is growing more complicated every year</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The internet's design lets different technologies work together, but new
risks emerge as software becomes more complex. Developers add layers to
simplify this complexity, but these layers can create security gaps or
vulnerabilities. As our digital world expands, the security risks increase,
especially with AI enabling more software creation and management.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>3. The lack of cybersecurity expertise and resources to combat attackers</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Attackers have significant advantages over defenders, who are stretched
thin across the digital ecosystem. While defenders must protect against
many threats, attackers can focus on a single target, exploiting vulnerabilities
and waiting for mistakes. Small businesses are especially vulnerable, as
they may lack the resources and expertise to defend against determined
attackers.</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Andre explains that with the current state of digital scams and how they
are evolving, AI must be used in cybersecurity efforts to combat the increasingly
sophisticated scams and address the defender’s dilemma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We have reached a point where we have no choice but to use artificial intelligence to help us do our jobs. There is so much </em><strong><em>telemetry data</em></strong><em> to analyse, and spotting any anomalous pattern or behaviour in this pool of data is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. So, we use AI to mimic the defender’s intuition in spotting anomalous behaviours, and at a much faster rate. In this sense, you can think of AI as a massive force multiplier.” </em>-
Andre Ng</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-card-grid">
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">What is Telemetry Data?</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Telemetry data is the automatic collection and transmission of data from
remote sources like servers, applications, and monitoring devices to a
central system. This process helps analyse and monitor system performance
and behaviour, making it vital for cybersecurity experts.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>With all the disadvantages that defenders face, there is growing evidence
that AI is the solution to their dilemma. Apart from the example of <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SATIS</a> and
how it is constantly improving its abilities to hunt down malicious sites,
another example would be the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anti-money-laundering-ai?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Anti Money Laundering AI tool</a> developed
by Google. It has already proven to be more effective in detecting suspicious
activities and reducing false positives with its machine-learning capabilities.</p>
<h3>Scammers are Becoming More Creative in Their Methods</h3>
<p>While the GASP team is working hard to develop more products to combat
scams, Mark acknowledges that scammers are becoming more creative and changing
their methods.</p>
<p>He provides the example of the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/which-sms-links-are-scams-and-which-are-not/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CDC vouchers scam incident</a> that
occurred earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When we first looked at this issue, we thought that ‘okay, they’re just trying to phish for banking or Singpass credentials.’ But what actually happened was a multi-stage scam in which the scammers asked victims for their phone number(s) and then sent them OTPs via Telegram or WhatsApp. Once victims keyed in the OTPs, the scammers took over the victims’ Telegram and WhatsApp accounts, messaging friends and family and asking them to transfer money to a third-party account. From the point of view of the eventual victim (the one who lost money), they were transferring money to their actual friend” </em>-
Mark Chen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding to Mark’s example of the CDC vouchers incident, Andre explains
that <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/how-to-tell-if-its-a-scam-the-red-flags-in-scam-messages-you-need-to-spot/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">scammers</a> are
getting better at mimicking legitimate websites and with the growing capabilities
of deepfake technology, it is even harder for the naked eye to spot suspicious
content.</p>
<p>“You can no longer look out for grammatical errors or the SSL certificate
to determine if a website is safe”, says Andre.</p>
<p>While scams are indeed getting harder to spot, Mark and Andre both agree
that the common convergence point for scammers is usually bank transfer
requests. Ultimately, scammers need to convince potential victims about
the truth of their claims and how money is somehow needed to fix the issue.</p>
<h3>The DNA of the GASP Team at GovTech</h3>
<p>The GASP team is very much an experimental unit that is constantly using
different methods of using AI to fight scams, and is currently expanding
SATIS’ capabilities to analyse online advertisements in addition to websites.</p>

<p><em>The team from GovTech’s Anti-Scam Products (GASP).</em>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Part of the process of creating successful products requires failure and if we don’t fail, then we won’t learn anything. So, we have to be comfortable with letting go of the ideas that didn’t work out because this is also part of the discovery process. Having this attitude is important for us if we want to catch up with the latest trends of scams.” </em>-
Mark Chen</p>

<h3>How to Check for Malicious Sites or Documents?</h3>
<p>Here are some online tools and ways that you can use to verify websites,
documents, emails and more:</p>
<h4>Google Cloud’s VirusTotal</h4>
<p>Google Cloud’s <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VirusTotal</a> has
been using AI to analyse suspicious files, domains, URLs and more to determine
if it is malicious or safe to use. The data is also automatically shared
with the security community so that they can use the data to train better
AI detection models.</p>
<h4>ScamShield</h4>
<p>Download the <a href="https://www.scamshield.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield app</a> to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<h4>CheckMateSG</h4>
<p><a href="https://checkmate.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CheckMateSG</a> is
a ground-up initiative that relies on a network of volunteers, called CheckMates,
and AI to combat misinformation and scams. Users can send messages to the
CheckMate bot, which then forwards them to CheckMates for verification.
Once the message is analysed by the majority of the CheckMates, CheckMateSG
informs the user if the message is likely a scam. This system is dedicated
to protecting the community by addressing misinformation and scams, one
message at a time.</p>
