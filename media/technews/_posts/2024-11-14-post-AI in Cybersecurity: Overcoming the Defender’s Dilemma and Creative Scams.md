<p>The complexity of cybersecurity grows as the digital world continues to
evolve. Hackers are becoming more creative, sophisticated scams are on
the rise, and with the integration of AI into these malicious tactics,
cybersecurity experts face an uphill challenge. But there’s hope. <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/5-ai-terms-to-boost-your-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> is
increasingly seen as a powerful ally in cybersecurity, providing defenders
with the tools to detect, analyse, and disrupt potential threats. Hence,
GovTech’s Anti-Scam Products (GASP) team has <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">adopted AI</a> to

<h3>The Defender’s Dilemma in Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>In today’s digital age, cybersecurity is a relentless battle. While defenders
work tirelessly to safeguard systems from countless threats, attackers
only need to find one vulnerability to strike. This is the essence of the <em>Defender’s Dilemma</em>.
It highlights the difficult position cybersecurity professionals face:
they must defend every aspect of a system, while cybercriminals can focus
all their efforts on identifying and exploiting a single weak point.</p>
