<p>When it comes to Seoul, there’s absolutely no question it’s a smart city.</p>
<p>The "Land of the morning calm" often competes with Singapore and Tokyo
for the top spot when it comes to&nbsp;<a href="https://govinsider.asia/innovation/lessons-from-asias-smartest-nations-china-japan-korea-and-singapore/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">smart cities in Asia.</a>
</p>
<p>Of course, if being featured in the futuristic Marvels’ Avengers: Age
Of Ultron in 2015 isn’t enough, South Korea’s capital also has plenty of
cool smart city projects to back it up.</p>
<p>But enough talk, let’s see what neat projects they have going on there!</p>

<h3>The Owl Bus and mobile data</h3>
<p>In Korea, their ‘Night Rider’ buses get the objectively cooler name of&nbsp;
<a href="https://seoulsolution.kr/en/content/night-bus-called-owl-bus-route-design-using-big-data" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">‘Owl Bus.’</a>&nbsp;But the service’s true value goes deeper than that.</p>
<p>You see, Seoul is over 100 times bigger than Singapore – and sometimes,
getting home after hours can be tough if you don’t have a car. This is
particularly true for lower-income workers, who work in the city but live
in the more affordable but far-flung outskirts. For this group, getting
a taxi can be challenging. Not only is it expensive, but many taxi drivers
are unwilling to drive long distances and are worried about security.</p>
<p>What the Owl Bus did was to provide the equivalent of a night rider service
to late-night workers who were lower-wage.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Owl Bus?</p>
<p>City Officials decided to use Big Data to make the planning of the routes
far more efficient. By analysing the location of calls and text messages
of late-night travellers, three billion data points were used to finding
specific locations of departure and destinations of travellers.</p>
<p>The data also gave hints on which routes late-night travellers actually
use, including the road networks with the largest number of connections.</p>
<p>Based on the data collected, nine late-night Owl Bus routes were designed,
and as of 2019, it is estimated that service has replaced over 2 million
car trips!</p>
<h3>Smart elder care with smart plugs</h3>
<p>One thing that Singapore and South Korea have in common? An ageing population
– in 2020, the elderly accounted for 15.6 per cent of the total population
there (vs Singapore’s 15.2%).</p>
<p>Now, looking after the elderly has its challenges, but Seoul hopes that
by bringing technology into homes, care services can be provided in a more
efficient and timely manner.</p>
<p>One of the ways it’s doing so is via IoT devices, which detects human
movement, temperature, humidity, and brightness. Data collected by the
sensors are sent to several care service centres for real-time monitoring
– and also a mobile app for caregivers. If no movement is detected for
a prolonged period of time, caregivers will be alerted to either make a
call or make a house visit.</p>
<p>As of last year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.donga.com/en/article/all/20200306/1997981/1/Seoul-to-increase-smart-IoT-devices-to-care-for-the-elderly" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">5,000 households</a>&nbsp;are
already equipped with these devices, and the intention is to increase this
number by 2,500 every year till 2023.</p>
<h3>Songdo, the smart district</h3>
<p>One major challenge that cities face in the transition to a Smart City
is that many of them were conceived in an era where the concept of Smart
City did not exist.</p>
<p>Songdo, just 30 km away from Seoul, solves this problem by starting from
scratch. First conceived in 2001 and completed in 2015, it’s built on reclaimed
land and is often hailed as one of the world’s first smart cities.</p>
<p>Not only is it equipped with sensors that’s able to harness data of weather,
transport and energy, it’s also home to the world’s highest concentration
of LEED buildings – the most widely used green building rating system in
the world.</p>
<p>Here’s one thing that you might find interesting – there are no garbage
bins, trucks or centres on the streets. Instead, pneumatic tubes send your
waste straight to a subterranean waste facility, where rubbish is processed.</p>
<p>In Singapore, this is very much like the waste systems seen in newer HDB
estates, such as those in Punggol Northshore, Bidadari, Tampines North,
and Tengah.</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s important to acknowledge that Songdo is still very
much a work in progress and is currently home to an estimated 70,000 people.</p>
<p>That said, cities do take time to blossom, and Songdo’s story is far from
over. The city is still in its developmental years. If anything, it’s a
reminder to all of us that hardware is only one aspect of a smart city—heartware
is equally important.</p>
