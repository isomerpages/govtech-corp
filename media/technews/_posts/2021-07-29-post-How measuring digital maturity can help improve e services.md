  agencies. Dive into the evolving landscape of e-services, using different
  indicators.

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has thrust technology to the forefront, as it brings
new ways for people to continue working, studying and gathering during
a time of heightened safety measures. Going forward, there is no question
that key digital technologies such as cloud computing, contactless payments,
and biometrics will be part of a government’s and a country’s strategic
capabilities.</p>

<p>What remains for many experts in the field is how to measure the level
of adoption and maturity when it comes to using such digital tools. For
government agencies, it is important for them to understand where they
stand and how effective they have been when rolling out e-services to serve
citizens.</p>
<h3>How mature are you?</h3>
<p>Should they measure their digital maturity by looking at “hard” indicators
such as the value of contracts given out or the openness of the data available
for use?</p>
<p>These are revealing indicators and are often used by consulting firms
to evaluate how digitally mature and ready an organisation is for the future.
But there has to be something more. Feedback is critical as well to the
success of an e-service. What are citizens saying about a popular app that
lets them transact with the government, for example? What do the agencies
think of their own efforts?</p>
<p>When measuring digital maturity, the result should not be a snapshot of
a certain point in time. Instead, it should be something that is dynamic,
changing often as an organisation strives to meet new challenges.</p>
<p>Around the world, the most digitally advanced countries, such as Britain,
are looking to measure how far they have come on their digital journey
and what they must do to improve and move further into the future. Among
the indicators that Britain is exploring are user-centric design, data-driven
decision-making, and having the appropriate technology and infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Meeting expectations</h3>
<p>Singapore has been doing the same. In 2018, after Singapore’s Digital
Government Blueprint was unveiled, government agencies started putting
together a framework of what it means for an organisation to be “digital
to the core”.</p>
<p>The framework covered different aspects of being digital, from why (strategy)
to what (digitalising business areas, to use data to formulate policies)
and how (covering people, data and technology), so that agencies could
evaluate how digitally mature they were, so they could improve their services
to meet the three stakeholders’ expectations.</p>
<p>From here, the agencies rated themselves on different aspects of the framework,
and the overall results were compiled into one of four levels – starter,
literate, performer or leader – depending on their extent of digitalisation
across the various areas of why, what and how. The answers made for some
interesting insights. The bulk of the agencies perceived themselves as
digitally literate, while the rest saw themselves as performers. There
were no agencies whose results were rated as leaders.</p>
<p>This result is a reflection of the journey that many agencies see themselves
on. There is still room for improvement.</p>
<h3>Knowing your strengths and weaknesses</h3>
<p>Crucially, the self-assessment also allows them to know their strengths
and weaknesses and work on them. Generally, the top six areas that needed
improvement on a whole-of-government level were:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Leveraging Data to create value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploying Agile at Scale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designing end-to-end service journey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging digital tools and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthening people capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building Digital ecosystems and partnerships</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What the self-assessment offers is a way to gauge this digital maturity.
This, in turn, gives them a clearer picture when drawing up a digitalisation
plan to plug the gaps, say, in strategy, data or capability development.</p>
<p>One encouraging thing that has emerged from the digital maturity assessment
is the clarity of purpose among many agencies. Many were keen to share
their experiences and go in-depth into the lessons learned and how they
can better serve citizens through digital enhancements in the future. That
is the way forward.</p>
<p>Excellence can only be possible when a problem is tackled properly. In
terms of a digital government, Singapore is making sure it knows how well
it is performing over time, so there is a continuous effort to improve.
Ultimately, this is done so that e-services can better serve citizens as
their requirements change.</p>
