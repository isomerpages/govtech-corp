<h3>GovTech and national water agency PUB joined forces to create a model that helps Singapore effectively manage its precious water resources.</h3>
<p>Every day, Singapore uses about 430 million gallons of water‚Äîan amount
equivalent to 782 Olympic-sized swimming pools. In a few decades, demand
is expected to nearly double. Fresh water is undeniably a necessity, and
yet, it‚Äôs one resource that Singapore also naturally lacks. Adding fuel
to the fire is the looming threat of prolonged dry spells caused by climate
change.</p>
<p>PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, is responsible for ensuring Singapore‚Äôs
water supply in the face of these challenges. On a daily basis, operators
at PUB need to determine how to smartly allocate water resources to satisfy
demand islandwide, a task easier said than done.</p>
<p>To help operators make these decisions, a team composed of PUB engineers
and GovTech data scientists built a model that optimally allocates water
resources based on operational constraints. Since the model‚Äôs implementation,
planning time has been reduced from two hours to as low as fifteen minutes.
Here‚Äôs how GovTech and PUB made every drop count‚Äîusing data science techniques.</p>
<h3>Tapping Singapore‚Äôs water resources</h3>
<p>Singapore obtains its water from four sources dubbed the ‚ÄúFour National
Taps,‚Äù namely water from local catchments or reservoirs, imported water,
high-grade reclaimed used water called NEWater and desalinated water from
the oceans. As climate change warms the world and dries our water bodies,
weather-independent sources like the last two are expected to contribute
to more of Singapore‚Äôs water supply.</p>
<p>It should be noted, though, that not all taps are created equal; some
are more expensive than others. Sources like NEWater and desalinated water,
for instance, require extensive processing methods that come at a price.
Hence, PUB operators will need to determine on a daily basis how to allocate
water from these four sources to satisfy water demand islandwide.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the team used a common optimisation technique known
as linear programming for their model. In linear programming, complex relationships
are depicted as linear functions, similar to lines on a graph. This greatly
simplified many parameters coded into the model, including the different
water sources and connecting pipes.</p>
<p>All these factors, along with other operational constraints‚Äîlike the capacity
of treatment plants and storage tanks, as well as the size of the water
pipes‚Äîwere taken into account by the team when coding the model. The model
then finds the optimised solution for the given objective given the operational
constraints.</p>
<p>Therefore, in a hypothetical scenario of cost minimisation, where a PUB
operator has to decide between drawing water from a raw water treatment
plant or a desalination plant, the model will choose the former. ‚Äú[Between]
the raw water treatment plant and the desalination plant,‚Äù explained Mr
Tan Kai Wei, an associate computational scientist at GovTech‚Äôs Data Science
Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID). ‚ÄúIt will make sense to draw from
the cheaper alternative, which is from the raw water treatment plant.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Satisfying and satisficing water demand</h3>
<p>While the example above gives a glimpse of how the model can work under
limited conditions, real life is far more tricky. Demand for water can
vary from day to day, as can the amount of rainfall. ‚ÄúLast year, July and
August were very dry,‚Äù recalled Dr. Loke Gar Goei, a quantitative analyst
also at GovTech‚Äôs DSAID. ‚ÄúThe amount of rainfall we had last year in this
period was only 1.2% of what would fall in this period historically.‚Äù</p>
<p>To ensure the flexibility of their model even in such unexpected situations,
the team turned to a technique called satisficing. Instead of choosing
the most optimal solution, the model goes for a more conservative option
that merely satisfies, or ‚Äòsatisfices,‚Äô any operational requirements.</p>
<p>According to the team, their model is the first in the world to attempt
the usage of satisficing in managing water resources. In aiming to satisfice
instead of optimise, the impact of uncertainty on the model‚Äôs decision-making
capabilities is softened.</p>

<h3>Putting the model through the test</h3>
<p>Upon completion, the model was trialled on data from last year‚Äôs dry spell
to establish its effectiveness. The results were encouraging, but given
the novelty of the satisficing approach and the quality of available forecast
data, the team eventually decided to go for a compromise scenario-based
approach where the model is used to optimise for different scenarios instead.</p>
<p>With this approach, the team was still able to automate a large part of
the planning process and increase the optimality of derived solutions.
Furthermore, the team also developed several innovative programming solutions
to ensure easier adoption by operators. All these reduced the time required
for detailed operations planning and improved operational outcomes.</p>
<p>Beyond reducing the time needed to make decisions, the team is quick to
highlight the wider relevance of their unique water management model. ‚ÄúOne
of the main reasons we wanted to do this is because, in a public policy
setting, we cannot afford large errors,‚Äù shared Dr Loke. ‚ÄúWater is a public
good. Because of this, we have to be prudent in the way we go about making
decisions.‚Äù</p>
