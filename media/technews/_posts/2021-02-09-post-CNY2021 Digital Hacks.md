<p>Ah, hindsight is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>As we were celebrating Chinese New Year in 2020, few of us imagined that
the pandemic would still be lingering over our heads in 2021.</p>
<p>After last year‚Äôs events, it‚Äôs clear that everyone can truly appreciate
the seriousness of the COVID-19 situation right now. Though the situation
has stabilised, we‚Äôre not out of the woods yet. Now, more than ever, it‚Äôs
important to stay healthy and safe while celebrating CNY.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some hacks to help you get into the festive
mood!</p>

<p><em>2021, a different kind of CNY. PHOTO: <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/food/masks-and-gloves-on-and-no-shouting-please-quieter-lohei-to-welcome-year-of-the-ox" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UNSPLASH.COM</a></em>

<h3>Streaming for reunion dinners and visitations</h3>
<p>With gatherings kept to eight people, bai nian is about to get a lot more
quiet. What might work for larger families is that they might meet online
instead, in groups of eight.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what you might want to do ahead of CNY:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Standardise the platforms you‚Äôll use: Zoom, Teams or Google Hangouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the setup of your live stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can your camera capture the whole table?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of lighting does your space have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can your audio-visual equipment stand the sticky mess that Lo Hei typically
results in?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Giving Lo Hei a digital spin</h3>
<p>Speaking of Lo Hei, you‚Äôve probably heard the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/food/masks-and-gloves-on-and-no-shouting-please-quieter-lohei-to-welcome-year-of-the-ox" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">news by now about the curbs</a>&nbsp;on
shouting auspicious phrases. But the annual tossing of Yu Sheng doesn‚Äôt
have to be a silent affair, thanks to some nifty apps.</p>
<p>Just tap on the phrase of your choice, and it‚Äôll be belted out of your
phone with gusto. There‚Äôs even a&nbsp;<a href="http://djbeng.com/lohei.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">version with dialect readings</a>,
while others are&nbsp;<a href="https://lovolume-lohei.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">helpfully organised by ingredients</a>&nbsp;instead.
For instance, tap on the sweet sauce, and the app will read out the appropriate
auspicious phrase for that condiment (a definite lifesaver because, let‚Äôs
face it, most of us can‚Äôt remember which phrase goes with which ingredient).</p>
<h3>e-Ang Pows for hygiene purposes</h3>
<p>Compared to the early 2010s where digital payments were clunky and fiddly
to use, these days, many people will have their mobile number linked with
PayNow, making transfers easy.</p>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs look at the pros and cons of digital Ang Pows:</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>
</p>
<p>If you find the packing of Ang Pows a chore, the good news for you is
that COVID-19 (and just germs in general) is a legitimate excuse to use
one of the many payment apps. ‚ÄúAiya, money got germs.‚Äù</p>
<p>If you have the PayNow details of all your relatives, you could potentially
complete your money-dispersing responsibilities within an hour.</p>
<p>Even better ‚Äì you could set up standing instructions with your bank so
you won‚Äôt need to go through the process next year.</p>
<p>In addition, those who aren‚Äôt too generous in their Ang Pow operations
could benefit from some distance; you won‚Äôt get to see the look of disapproval
that happens when you give ‚Äòbelow market value.‚Äô</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>
</p>
<p>None. Unless you really like the feeling of cash in your hands.</p>
<h3>Bond through virtual activities?</h3>
<p>One reason why we look forward to CNY is the myriad of activities we can
get up to with a large crowd. Here are some ways to overcome the physical
distance and still do our favourite things together.</p>
<p><strong>Unleash your inner singing diva</strong>
</p>
<p>One significant victim of the pandemic is definitely karaoke. Fortunately,
technology has responded quickly, with a variety of services popping up
to facilitate karaoke without everyone being in the same room.</p>
<p>Most of these are paid or subscription services but we feel it‚Äôs definitely
worth it to spend a little for what is, after all, a special occasion.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre on a budget, there are articles such as this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zoom-karaoke-party/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">one</a>&nbsp;on
how to host a virtual karaoke party for free.</p>
<p><strong>Stream the classic CNY shows for some quality time</strong>
</p>
<p>A more passive but no less enjoyable annual ritual is gathering around
to watch some classic CNY shows playing on TV, typically one starring Jackie
Chan, Stephen Chow, Donnie Yen or any of their contemporaries.</p>
<p>Thanks to the abundance of streaming options today, each household can
stay in, press ‚Äòplay‚Äô at the same time, and tune in to the same programme,
all while chatting about the plot over a video call.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a suggestion: with some classic Channel 8 Singaporean dramas now
available on Netflix, you might wanna relive the glory of the 1980s and
1990s with your older folks, who will no doubt appreciate the nostalgia.</p>
<p>Some highlights we thought you and your relatives might find interesting:</p>
<p><em>The Unbeatables (1993)</em>&nbsp;is legendary as the classic gambling
show, which has that epic ‚ÄúI will use this $10 to win your casino‚Äù line.
It features old-time favourites Zoey Tay and Li Nanxing in them.</p>
<p>The Singaporean remake of&nbsp;<em>Return of the Condor Heroes (1998)</em>&nbsp;is
also available, and it features Fann Wong and Christoper Lee.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Price of Peace(1997)</em>&nbsp;is about the Japanese occupation,
and it might be a rather grim watch during Chinese New Year, but it‚Äôs bound
to start some really interesting conversations between the generations.</p>
<p>Finally, we have&nbsp;<em>Stepping Out (1999)</em>&nbsp;which probably
is a slightly more light-hearted watch. It documents the Chinese immigrant
journey in Singapore during the 20th century.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the youngest of the Pioneer Generation now in their
70s, every Chinese New Year with your grandparents should be treasured.
And being to have them share their experiences, memories and perspectives
is something that is truly invaluable.</p>
<h3>No physical gathering, no problem</h3>
<p>As you can see, just because there‚Äôs no extended family gathering this
year doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt all have fun together. A little tech, creativity,
and willpower are all we need.</p>
<h3>Here‚Äôs wishing you and your family a meaningful and healthy Chinese New Year!</h3>
