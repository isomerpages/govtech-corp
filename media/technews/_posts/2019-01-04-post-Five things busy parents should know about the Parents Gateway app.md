<h3>TL:DR: Schools are dynamic places for learning and parents are important stakeholders in their children’s education. MOE and GovTech have thus launched the Parents Gateway mobile app as a one-stop platform for schools and parents to communicate more conveniently. Here are five ways the app can benefit busy parents.</h3>
<p>For busy parents, keeping up with their children’s schedules in school
can be quite challenging. School children sometimes misplace consent forms
or forget to get their parents to sign them, or parents may miss important
announcements made by teachers.</p>
<p>Such problems could become a thing of the past with a new mobile app —Parents
Gateway—co-developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Government
Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech).</p>
<p>Launched just in time for the start of a new school term in January 2019,
the Parents Gateway mobile app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store
and the AppStore, and serves as a ‘special assistant’ to parents, helping
them streamline their interactions with schools.</p>
<p>The one-stop portal also helps reduce the administrative workload of teachers,
freeing up their time so they can focus more on lesson preparation and
student engagement.</p>
<p>Read on to find out more about the key functions and benefits of using
the Parents Gateway mobile app.</p>
<h3>1. One app to rule them all</h3>
<p>Currently, parents with children attending different schools will need
to download separate apps for each child and may have to switch platforms
or accounts as their kid progresses through the education system.</p>
<p>Parents Gateway, on the other hand, centralises the information so that
parents can access information on all their children in one place regardless
of school they are from. When a student moves from one level to another
or from one school to another, his or her particulars will be updated automatically
on the app, reducing hassle on the part of parents.</p>

<h3>2. Always be in the know</h3>
<p>Given the flurry of activities planned for students during every school
term, parents can easily get overwhelmed by information about school events.</p>
<p>With Parents Gateway, schools make use of push notifications to keep parents
in the loop about programmes taking place within and beyond the classrooms.
Simply by tapping on a link on the notification page of the app, parents
can add the date, time and venue details of an activity to their phone
calendars. The app also allows rapid dissemination of information to parents
in the event of early dismissals or emergencies such as school closures.</p>

<h3>3. Watch them learn</h3>
<p>Being a digital platform, Parents Gateway allows communication between
schools and parents to go beyond text-based exchanges. In addition to short
messages, teachers can attach videos and photos of students carrying out
learning activities, thereby giving parents a more visual account of their
children’s experiences at school via the app. This feature will be progressively
improved.</p>
<h3>4. No more paper cuts</h3>
<p>During the pilot trial of Parents Gateway at ten MOE schools, some schools
were able to eliminate hardcopy forms and letters from their administrative
processes successfully. Besides cutting down the hassle of printing and
distributing forms, the app also results in cost savings for schools.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with just the click of a button, parents can consent to send
their children on camping trips and excursions. A travel declaration function
is also expected to be rolled out on Parents Gateway this year.</p>

<h3>5. More functions on the horizon</h3>
<p>Sometimes, school activities may require payment through a child’s Edusave
account. Therefore, MOE and GovTech are currently working on a feature
to allow parents to check the balance of their child’s Edusave account
before granting access to the activities.</p>
<p>Another critical touchpoint between parents and schools is the parent-teacher
conference. Instead of having to schedule meetings over phone calls or
paper-based forms, the aim is to have an online reservation system for
a more convenient allocation of meeting slots.</p>
<p>These functions and more will be added gradually to Parents Gateway to
serve the needs of teachers, parents and children better, so stay tuned!</p>
