<p>Singapore is leaning into the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
automation across all sectors, and education is no exception. Why the big
push? Because it offers some incredible opportunities to make learning
more effective, engaging, and even personalised for our students.</p>
<p>GovTech is right there in the thick of it, constantly exploring and innovating
on its AI capabilities to better support our educators. Think of it as
tools that can help teachers understand their students better, create more
tailored lessons, and even automate some of those time-consuming tasks.</p>
<p>So, what does this look like in our schools and classrooms? This article
will give you a peek into the practical ways AI is already making a difference
and what the future holds.</p>
<h3>The role of AI and automation in the education sector</h3>
<p>It's clear that AI’s role in education is really taking off, and for good
reason. Think of it less as replacing our teachers and more as equipping
them with new tools. From crafting more personalised learning journeys
to unlocking deeper insights from student data, AI has the potential to
truly transform both the art of teaching and the experience of learning.</p>
<p>This evolution has even gained momentum in recent years, particularly
when remote learning became the norm during the pandemic, underscoring
the vital need for the kind of flexible and adaptable educational environments
that AI can help us build.</p>
<h3>Benefits of using AI in the classroom</h3>
<p>AI opens up some fantastic possibilities to enhance the learning experience
for everyone involved. Let's dive into some of its key advantages:</p>
<h4>Refining assessment and analytics in education</h4>
<p>Imagine having tools that can analyse student performance in a much more
detailed way, going beyond just grades. AI can help teachers gain deeper
insights into individual learning patterns, identify areas where students
might be struggling, and even predict potential challenges. This allows
for more targeted support and intervention.</p>
<h4>Personalised learning content and real-time feedback </h4>
<p>Think about lessons that adapt to each student's unique pace and learning
style. AI makes this possible by curating personalised content and providing
immediate feedback. This means students can get the support they need,
right when they need it, leading to more effective learning and a greater
sense of accomplishment.</p>
<h4>Supporting digital literacy</h4>
<p>In today's world, being digitally savvy is crucial. AI tools can play
a big role in helping students develop these essential skills. From interactive
learning platforms to AI-powered tutors that explain complex concepts,
these technologies can make learning about and navigating the digital world
more engaging and accessible.</p>
<h4>Productivity and efficiency through automation</h4>
<p>Let's face it, teachers have a lot on their plates. AI can step in to
automate some of the more time-consuming administrative tasks, like grading
basic assignments or scheduling. This frees up teachers to focus on what
they do best: connecting with students, creating engaging lessons, and
providing personalised guidance.</p>

<h3>Adaptive learning systems for mathematics</h3>
<p>Students learn at a different pace, and a teacher often has to deal with
a class where some have already grasped the concept while others are still
struggling. To address this, MOE has been trialling an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/contact-mar20.ashx" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">adaptive learning system</a>&nbsp;enhanced
by machine learning that can assess student performance in real-time and
adjust their learning pathways accordingly.</p>
<p>In one school, students completed modules on maths subjects before class,
and teachers received reports on their performance. In the classrooms,
the students were able to ask better questions about the subject and discuss
how maths could be used in real-life situations.</p>
<p>The teachers could also mix students of different abilities together so
that they could do peer learning and teaching.</p>
<p>Those working on the system are now taking in teachers’ feedback, such
as the need for more localised examples and the ability for students to
enter their mathematical work into the programme.</p>
<h3>AI-enabled learning companion</h3>
<p>Another project from the Smart Nation initiative is the development of
an AI-enabled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/files/publications/national-ai-strategy.pdf" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">learning companion</a>.
It will be able to support holistic learning by motivating the student
while he or she is doing a challenging task, encouraging reflection on
the learning experience, and recommending further learning activities.</p>
<p>While the use of AI as a learning companion is still relatively new, there
are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/why-ai-can-better-help-students-as-learning-buddy-not-teacher" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">promising areas</a>&nbsp;to
explore. For example, AI can be used to detect a student’s engagement level
with the study material by tracking the student’s eye moment and the duration
spent on specific parts of the document.</p>
<p>For maths problems, the companion can identify the part that is presenting
problems for the student and provide hints, resources, or prompts for an
alternative method.</p>
<p>While recognising AI’s potential as a learning companion, it is also important
to acknowledge its limitations. For instance, interpreting a student’s
behaviour during the learning process might be a task that is complex for
AI. Can it correctly read the facial expression of a student and tell if
he or she is concentrating or simply spacing out?</p>
<h3>Training teachers to use AI</h3>
<p>With technology rapidly evolving, teachers must keep up with changes and
upskill accordingly. The National Institute of Education&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/nie-to-train-teachers-in-using-ai-in-classroom-invest-in-research" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;in
May 2022 that it will step up efforts to train teachers to employ AI in
teaching.</p>
<p>By 2026, topics about artificial intelligence in education will be offered
for trainee teachers at all levels, including undergraduates, post-graduate
and in-service teachers. As part of a five-year plan called AI@NIE, the
institute will also invest in research and innovation to use artificial
intelligence for education.</p>
<h3>AI as a complement, not a replacement</h3>
<p>Even as Singapore explores ways to increase AI’s usage in education, experts
and officials have reiterated that technology will never fully replace
the crucial role that teachers play in educating and guiding students.</p>
<p>After all, teachers are not just repositories of facts and figures that
are regurgitated to students. They nurture, inspire, and encourage young
minds to stretch their curiosity. They also provide human communication
and support as youngsters mature and find their place in the world. These
are roles that AI will not be able to take on.</p>
<p>As Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative, Vivian Balakrishnan
said: “At the heart of education is interaction… I do not believe that
AI will ever replace teachers.”</p>
