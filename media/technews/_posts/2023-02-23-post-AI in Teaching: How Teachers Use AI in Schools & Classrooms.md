<p>Singapore is leaning into the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
automation across all sectors, and education is no exception. Why the big
push? Because it offers some incredible opportunities to make learning
more effective, engaging, and even personalised for our students.</p>
<p>GovTech is right there in the thick of it, constantly exploring and innovating
on its AI capabilities to better support our educators. Think of it as
tools that can help teachers understand their students better, create more
tailored lessons, and even automate some of those time-consuming tasks.</p>
<p>So, what does this look like in our schools and classrooms? This article
will give you a peek into the practical ways AI is already making a difference
and what the future holds.</p>
<h3>The role of AI and automation in the education sector</h3>
<p>It's clear that AI’s role in education is really taking off, and for good
reason. Think of it less as replacing our teachers and more as equipping
them with new tools. From crafting more personalised learning journeys
to unlocking deeper insights from student data, AI has the potential to
truly transform both the art of teaching and the experience of learning.</p>
<p>This evolution has even gained momentum in recent years, particularly
when remote learning became the norm during the pandemic, underscoring
the vital need for the kind of flexible and adaptable educational environments
that AI can help us build.</p>
<h3>Benefits of using AI in the classroom</h3>
<p>AI opens up some fantastic possibilities to enhance the learning experience
for everyone involved. Let's dive into some of its key advantages:</p>
<h4>Refining assessment and analytics in education</h4>
<p>Imagine having tools that can analyse student performance in a much more
detailed way, going beyond just grades. AI can help teachers gain deeper
insights into individual learning patterns, identify areas where students
might be struggling, and even predict potential challenges. This allows
for more targeted support and intervention.</p>
<h4>Personalised learning content and real-time feedback</h4>
<p>Think about lessons that adapt to each student's unique pace and learning
style. AI makes this possible by curating personalised content and providing
immediate feedback. This means students can get the support they need,
right when they need it, leading to more effective learning and a greater
sense of accomplishment.</p>
<h4>Supporting digital literacy</h4>
<p>In today's world, being digitally savvy is crucial. AI tools can play
a big role in helping students develop these essential skills. From interactive
learning platforms to AI-powered tutors that explain complex concepts,
these technologies can make learning about and navigating the digital world
more engaging and accessible.</p>
<h4>Productivity and efficiency through automation</h4>
<p>Let's face it, teachers have a lot on their plates. AI can step in to
automate some of the more time-consuming administrative tasks, like grading
basic assignments or scheduling. This frees up teachers to focus on what
they do best: connecting with students, creating engaging lessons, and
providing personalised guidance.</p>
<h3>How teachers can use AI</h3>
<p>So, how can teachers actually start using AI in their day-to-day work?
There are already some existing tools that can make a real difference.
Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive learning systems:</strong> These platforms use AI algorithms
to adjust the difficulty and content of learning materials based on a student's
performance in real-time. It's like having a personalised tutor for each
student, ensuring they’re challenged appropriately and receive support
where they need it most.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI-powered assessment tools: </strong>Beyond just grading, AI
can analyse student responses to identify common misconceptions and provide
teachers with valuable insights into the overall understanding of the class.
This helps teachers tailor future lessons to address specific learning
gaps more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intelligent tutoring systems: </strong>These AI-driven systems
can provide students with personalised guidance and support on specific
subjects. They can answer questions, offer explanations, and provide targeted
practice, acting as a virtual teaching assistant that's available 24/7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated administrative tasks: </strong>AI can help automate
tasks like generating basic quizzes, scheduling parent-teacher conferences,
or even organising learning resources. This saves teachers valuable time,
allowing them to focus more on direct student interaction and lesson planning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3 key AI applications in Singapore’s education sector</h3>
<p>It's not just theory – AI is already making waves in our schools! Here
are three key areas where you can see it in action, promising to reshape
how our students learn and how our teachers teach.</p>
<h4>Automated English marking systems</h4>
<p>As part of Singapore’s national AI strategy, the Ministry of Education
is working on rolling out <a href="https://www.snec.com.sg/news/academic-medicine/singapores-artificial-intelligence-strategy-applying-ai-to-help-not-replace-people" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>automated systems</u></a> to
help mark English language assignments in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>These AI-powered are designed to spot tricky language errors – grammar,
spelling and how sentences are put together (syntax). This frees up teachers
to focus on higher-level concepts, from ideas and content to overall tone.
MOE believes this will give teachers back valuable time that they can then
use to create even better lessons and strengthen relations with students.</p>
<p>Another benefit of the system is its ability to collect data on common
grammar mistakes so that teachers can work on these areas with their students.</p>
<p>But don’t worry, the ministry isn’t planning to use these systems for
marking exams, including critical assessments like the Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE).</p>
<h4>Adaptive learning systems for mathematics</h4>
<p>MOE has been trialling an <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/contact-mar20.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>adaptive learning system</u></a> enhanced
by machine learning to keep an eye on how students are doing in real-time
and then adjust their learning pathways accordingly.</p>
<p>In one school, students completed maths modules before class, and teachers
received reports on their performance. This means that when they were in
the classrooms, the students could ask much more focused questions and
discuss how maths could be used in real-life situations.</p>
<p>The teachers could also mix students of different abilities together so
that they could do peer learning and teaching.</p>
<p>Those working on the AI system are now taking in teachers’ feedback, such
as the need for more localised examples and the ability for students to
enter their mathematical work into the programme.</p>
<h4>H3 AI-enabled learning companion</h4>
<p>Another project from the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/our-enhanced-smart-nation-vision-paving-the-way-for-a-new-digital-era/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Smart Nation initiative</u></a> is
the development of an AI-enabled <a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/files/publications/national-ai-strategy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>learning companion</u></a>.
The idea here is to create a digital buddy that can support holistic learning
by motivating the student while they’re doing a challenging task, encouraging
them to reflect on what they've learned, and even suggesting what they
should explore next.</p>
<p>While using artificial intelligence as a learning companion is still pretty
new territory, there are <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/why-ai-can-better-help-students-as-learning-buddy-not-teacher" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>promising areas</u></a> to
explore. For example, AI could potentially gauge how engaged a student
is with the educational material by tracking their eye movements and how
long they spend on different parts of the document.</p>
<p>When it comes to maths problems, the companion can know exactly where
a student is getting stuck and then offer targeted hints, resources, or
prompts for an alternative method.</p>
<p>Of course, while AI has a lot of AI’s potential as a learning companion,
it’s also important to acknowledge its limitations. For instance, interpreting
a student’s behaviour during the learning process can be quite complex.
Can AI correctly read a student’s facial expression and tell if they’re
concentrating or simply spacing out?</p>
<h3>Upskilling teachers to use AI</h3>
<h4>AI@NIE: National Institute of Education's initiative</h4>
<p>With technology rapidly evolving, teachers must keep up with changes and
upskill accordingly. The National Institute of Education <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/nie-to-train-teachers-in-using-ai-in-classroom-invest-in-research" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> in
May 2022 that it would step up efforts to train teachers to employ AI in
teaching.</p>
<p>By 2026, topics about artificial intelligence in education will be offered
for trainee teachers at all levels, including undergraduates, post-graduate
and in-service teachers. As part of a five-year plan called AI@NIE, the
institute will also invest in research and innovation to use artificial
intelligence for education.</p>
<h3>Building collaborations to drive AI adoption in education ahead</h3>
<p>It's a team effort to make AI work wonders in education, and that's why
GovTech is actively joining forces with our educational institutions and
some of the brightest minds in private tech. The goal is to create and
roll out AI tools that genuinely make a difference in our classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're also encouraging our teachers to jump in and explore these digital
products developed by GovTech – they're designed to help you work smarter,
not harder, and ultimately enhance your teaching. So, if you're an educator,
a student with bright ideas, or an ICT vendor with cutting-edge solutions,
we want to hear from you! Let's collaborate and harness the potential of
AI and these GovTech platforms together.</p>
<h3>Addressing limitations of AI in education</h3>
<p>While AI opens up some truly amazing possibilities in education, it's
also crucial to be realistic. Just like any tool, AI isn't perfect, and
here are a few important things to consider about the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/generative-ai-where-can-it-go-wrong/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>limitations of AI</u></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The human touch</strong>: AI can analyse data and personalise
learning paths, but it can't fully replicate the empathy, nuanced understanding,
and inspirational connection that a human teacher provides. Those "aha!"
moments often come from a teacher’s ability to read a room and connect
with students on a personal level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bias in algorithms</strong>: AI systems learn from the data they're
fed. If that data contains biases, the AI can inadvertently perpetuate
those biases in its assessments and recommendations. Ensuring fairness
and equity in AI tools requires careful attention to the data we use to
train them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Over-reliance and critical thinking</strong>: If we're not careful,
an over-reliance on AI could potentially hinder the development of students'
critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Learning often involves grappling
with challenges and figuring things out independently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's why it's absolutely crucial to maintain human oversight in AI-driven
educational environments. Teachers are the navigators, guiding how these
tools are used and ensuring they complement, rather than replace, the essential
human elements of teaching and learning.</p>
<h3>Looking ahead: The future of AI in education</h3>
<p>Looking down the road, the next 5 to 10 years hold some truly exciting
possibilities for how AI will continue to shape education. We're likely
to see even more personalised and adaptive learning experiences, AI that
can provide more sophisticated feedback, and tools that can help predict
student learning outcomes to enable earlier interventions.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for these emerging AI technologies that are poised to
further transform education:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Natural language processing (NLP)</strong>: This will enable more
sophisticated AI tutors and learning companions that can understand and
respond to students in a more human-like way, offering richer explanations
and engaging in more natural dialogue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning analytics and educational data mining</strong>: We'll
see even more powerful tools that can analyse vast amounts of learning
data to provide deeper insights into student progress, identify effective
teaching strategies, and even predict potential learning difficulties early
on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explainable AI (XAI)</strong>: As AI becomes more complex, the
ability for it to explain its reasoning and recommendations will be crucial
for building trust and allowing teachers to understand and validate its
insights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>AI as a complement, not a replacement</h3>
<p>Even as Singapore explores ways to increase AI’s usage in education, experts
and officials have reiterated that technology will never fully replace
the crucial role that teachers play in educating and guiding students.</p>
<p>After all, teachers are not just repositories of facts and figures that
are regurgitated to students. They nurture, inspire, and encourage young
minds to stretch their curiosity. They also provide human communication
and support as youngsters mature and find their place in the world. These
are roles that AI won’t be able to take on.</p>
<p>As Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative, Vivian Balakrishnan
said: <em>“At the heart of education is interaction… I do not believe that AI will ever replace teachers.”</em>
