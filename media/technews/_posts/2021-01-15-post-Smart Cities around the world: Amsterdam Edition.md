<p>As you might know, Singapore scores pretty well amongst the world‚Äôs smart
cities ‚Äì Otherwise, why else would they shoot&nbsp;<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/westworld-season-3-singapore-11706008" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">WestWorld</a>&nbsp;here?</p>
<p>That said, we‚Äôre not the only ones out there. Cities around the world
are all racing to compete as ideal places to live, work and play, improving
the lives of their citizens.</p>
<p>Smart cities have numerous benefits, including reducing wastage, saving
on manpower costs, being environmentally sustainable, and of course, improving
the lives of its citizens by making government services either more accessible
or more efficient.</p>
<p>As part of our 3-part New Year special series, we‚Äôre taking a break from
looking at initiatives in Singapore, and focusing on some other smart cities
around the globe instead.</p>
<p>First off, the capital of Holland - Amsterdam</p>

</p>
<p>Fun fact: Apart from being amongst&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-tops-world-smart-city-index-again-lauded-for-handling-of-covid-19" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the world‚Äôs top 10 smart cities</a>,
Amsterdam shares more than a few similarities with Singapore. It was once
a fishing village, and though our urban landscapes differ, their colourful
17th-century low-rise historical buildings are somehow reminiscent of our
Straits-Chinese shophouses (if you use a little bit of imagination).</p>
<p>They say great minds think alike ‚Äì let‚Äôs see what our Dutch friends are
up to!</p>
<h3>The Mijnbuur app</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="The Mijnbuur app user interface that helps foster social responsibility" src="/images/technews/Smart_Cities_around_the_world_amsterdam_2.png">
</div>
<p><em>Read on to find out how The Mijnbuur app aims to foster a sense of social responsibility. PHOTO: <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/westworld-season-3-singapore-11706008" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.mijnbuur.nl/</a></em>
</p>
<p>The Mijnbuur app is probably the most wholesome thing you‚Äôll hear about.
It connects you with your neighbours, the local police, or your neighbourhood
director if you‚Äôre in need of help (be it a robbery, or if some day-to-day
maintenance issues). In the Netherlands, apartment owners are expected
to work together to maintain and keep their apartment complexes clean.</p>
<p>This is done through the charging of a monthly fee, and you‚Äôll be able
to request compensation from the pot of accumulated finances if, for instance,
your neighbour‚Äôs pipes were to burst and damage your ceilings. Or, you
could just use the Mijnbuur app to get a coffee with your neighbours. The
best part is that you don‚Äôt have to know Dutch to use the app; it auto-translates
your messages for you.</p>
<p>Singapore‚Äôs One Service app serves a similar function, except you won‚Äôt
be liaising with your neighbours, but your feedback on municipal issues
will be directly routed to the relevant agencies.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the aim of the Mijnbuur app is to foster a sense of social
responsibility and allow neighbours to peacefully solve disputes among
themselves. Besides improving community relationships, data from the app
provides government agencies with a clearer idea of the common issues faced
by residents in different neighbourhoods.</p>
<h3>Waste detection using cameras</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</p>
<p>Waste management has always been a challenging task for modern cities.
Each area has its own pattern of garbage production and the optimisation
of waste collection helps to both reduce costs and maintain the cleanliness
of the city.</p>
<p>As the city of Amsterdam relies on its residents to drop off their trash
bags at designated collection points at specific times, the collection
process has to be optimised to avoid the accumulation of trash at these
points.</p>
<p>To counter this problem, Amsterdam is currently teaching an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/news/2020/10/abs-research-keeps-amsterdam-clean-real-time-image-recognition-for-litter-collection.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">image recognition system</a>&nbsp;to
identify different types of waste, and its garbage trucks will soon be
fitted with smart cameras which can quantify the amount of rubbish there
are on the streets and at collection points.</p>
<p>In Singapore, we manage our waste slightly differently ‚Äì waste is consolidated
in rubbish chutes and bins. That said, towns in Pasir Ris and Tampines
are rolling something out that‚Äôs pretty similar ‚Äì&nbsp;<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smart-waste-system-tampines-pasir-ris-alerts-collection-crew-10719228" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">a smart waste system that informs collectors when the system is almost full!</a>
</p>
<h3>Easier access to parking lots</h3>
<p>The stress of driving is sometimes too overwhelming, especially if you‚Äôre
hyper-aware of the line of cars queuing up behind you as you very slowly
and shoddily attempt a parallel park. In fact, a whopping&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/business/key-sectors/smart-mobility/insights/amsterdam-smart-parking-solutions" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">30 per cent of city traffic</a>&nbsp;is
caused by drivers seeking a parking space. Finding a parking space faster
would thus lead to a reduction of congestion, fuel use, air pollution levels
and, of course, drivers‚Äô stress levels.</p>
<p><a href="https://amsterdamsmartcity.com/international-projects/smart-flow" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Flow</a>,
an IoT cloud-based platform, monitors sensors to report traffic flow and
parking availability across Amsterdam. When Smart Flow was first launched,
the average time required to find a parking space was significantly reduced
by 43 percent. On top of that, it helps drivers to make more fiscally responsible
choices by listing the cheapest options within the area.</p>
<p>Well, Singapore isn‚Äôt too far behind either, with something in the works
by our very own ST Electronics ‚Äî the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stengg.com/en/innovation/smart-car-park-platform-addresses-parking-challenges/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Car Park Platform</a>.
Combined with smartphone technologies, drivers will eventually be able
to search and book parking spaces, check parking rates, and even apply
for season parking through the mobile app.</p>
<h3>Smart Lighting</h3>
<p>Energy efficiency is one of the biggest goals of a smart city. Unfortunately,
though the lights along the streets of many cities use timers or light
sensors to limit the length of time the lights are turned on, the intensity
of the lights cannot be adjusted. Not only is this a waste of energy, but
light pollution can pose a threat to the health of wildlife and plants.</p>
<p>To solve these problems,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.luminext.eu/en/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Luminext</a>&nbsp;developed
an urban lighting system that regulates light intensity according to the
needs of citizens. This smart lighting system operates through remote sensors
and can also be adjusted from a control centre depending on how bright
or dim specific streets the city authorities desire them to be. Streetlights
reach maximum intensity once vehicles or people pass by and return to the
lowest intensity when the motion sensors do not detect anything on their
periphery.</p>
<p>Back home, we‚Äôve also realised the potential for lighting systems to improve
urban planning and operations. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/scewc2019/laap" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">smart lampposts</a>&nbsp;in
Singapore may not adjust their intensity automatically, but they do have
sensors that can detect and monitor changes to environmental conditions
like humidity, rainfall, temperature and pollutants in the air!</p>
<p>In addition, mounted cameras have analytic capabilities to count and analyse
crowd build-ups, as well as count, classify and monitor the speed of Personal
Mobility Devices (PMDs) to enhance safety in public spaces!</p>
<p>So there you have it ‚Äì great minds (and great cities) do think alike!</p>
