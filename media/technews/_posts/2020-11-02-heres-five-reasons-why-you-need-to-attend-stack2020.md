### **1. Learn from the pros**

STACK 2020 brings together more than [100 of the world’s leading technology experts](https://www.stack.gov.sg/speakers) to share their knowledge and insights.

### **2. Ideate and innovate**

No organisation has a monopoly on ideas. Given the rapid developments in the field of technology, being aware of some of the latest emerging ideas can be a boon for anyone working in tech. With more than 80 keynotes, talks, panels, workshops and on-demand videos covering topics on Cloud, Applications, Tech Culture and COVID-19 technologies at STACK 2020, you will be exposed to new concepts and novel ways of working that could help you level up professionally!

You will have ample opportunity to make connections and build up your professional network. You might just find the ideal mentor or discover a tech community to kickstart your next big project!

### **4. Gain hands-on experience**

The best way to learn is by doing. At STACK 2020, you will find an array of hands-on [workshops](https://www.stack.gov.sg/workshops) catering to individuals of various skill levels and interests. For example, join a [coding dojo](https://www.stack.gov.sg/workshops#workshop-a2) to work on a coding puzzle with other coders, or try your hand at [enhancing mobile app security through reverse engineering.](https://www.stack.gov.sg/workshops#workshop-p4)

Meanwhile, Docker and Kubernetes beginners can look forward to a step-by-step course on [how to design, develop and deploy applications in Kubernetes.](https://www.stack.gov.sg/workshops#workshop-a5) All workshops will take place on 1 December 2020. 


### **5. Rekindle your passion**
Sometimes, the plodding regularity of the office routine can make you forget why you chose your current job or career path. If that is the case, interacting with industry peers and seeing how they share their work with enthusiasm is one way to re-energise and recharge. You might just return to the office all fired up with fresh ideas and the confidence in 2021.
