</p>
<p>More Singaporeans are using government digital services and giving them
the thumbs-up just two years after the implementation of the Digital Government
Blueprint. The five-year plan, launched in June 2018, outlines how the
Government will better leverage data and harness new technologies to improve
lives.</p>
<p>In his keynote speech to wrap up GovTech‚Äôs five-week series, titled&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/reengineering-the-operating-system-of-the-government" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Re-engineering the Government‚Äôs Operating System</a>, released online
today, Mr Kok Ping Soon, chief executive of the Government Technology Agency
(GovTech), said that citizens‚Äô and businesses‚Äô satisfaction with government
digital services had increased by eight percentage points in 2019 to reach
86 per cent and 77 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>This is according to the Annual Digital Government Perception Survey,
which was conducted by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and
GovTech from November to December last year.</p>
<p>About 1,500 businesses from 13 industry sectors, including manufacturing,
transportation, financial and business services, and construction, were
surveyed. Another 1,500 citizens were surveyed during the same period.
The past year‚Äôs satisfaction survey scores are the highest since 2012.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have made good progress in making our government digital services
more user-centric, and we will be making an even bigger push this year
to humanise them as more service-journey projects transit from design and
development to minimum viable products,‚Äù Mr Kok added.</p>
<p>A minimum viable product refers to an early version of a product that
is created to test the product‚Äôs feasibility in an actual market scenario.
The Government will spend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/govt-to-award-up-to-35b-in-ict-contracts-80-open-to-smes-this-year" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">$3.5 billion this financial year</a>&nbsp;to
remake its operating systems and fund tech innovations to improve people‚Äôs
lives. More than $118 million from this budget will be pumped into&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/doubling-down-on-cloud-to-deliver-better-government-servicestechnology" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">information and communications</a>&nbsp;projects to develop better citizen-
and business-facing digital applications.</p>
<p>It will also refresh several apps that Singaporeans have come to rely
on, including SingPass Mobile, which is used by more than 1.5 million people,
to make them even more useful.</p>

</p>
<p>In the second half of the year, GovTech will offer more application programming
interfaces (API) for integration. These include digital signing,&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/fingerprint-facial-id-for-singpass-authentication" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">biometrics-as-a-service</a>, remote authorisation and MyInfo Business.</p>
<p>APIs allow digital applications to communicate with one another and enable
seamless data sharing among organisations. Over 100 businesses have integrated
with the National Digital Identity (ndi) platform via GovTech‚Äôs&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.ndi-api.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ndi APIs</a>&nbsp;since 2018. The platform is designed to provide more
convenience and security for citizens transacting online.</p>
<p>According to GovTech, close to 450,000 transactions are made on the platform
each month. The agency added that businesses in sectors like banking, insurance,
power supply and online retail have reported higher customer acquisition
rates and quicker transactions, with an 80 per cent reduction in transaction
time.</p>
<h3>Stronger partnerships</h3>
<p>To speed up the transformation and adoption of government digital services,
GovTech is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/govt-to-award-up-to-35b-in-ict-contracts-80-open-to-smes-this-year" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">strengthening its partnerships with industry and the community</a>&nbsp;to
co-create digital solutions. In June, it soft-launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Government Developer Portal</a>&nbsp;for
firms and developers to learn more about its tech products.</p>
<p>The portal is a centralised resource for developers to find key information
on product features, use cases and technical specifications to co-create
solutions with the Government, said Mr Kok.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver time, more features will be added to allow developers to offer their
services and for the portal to serve as a gateway to the government developers‚Äô
environment,‚Äù he stressed.</p>
<p>Government agencies are also reaching out to developers in other ways,
even as the COVID-19 pandemic has put a pause on in-person community events.
‚ÄúWe are now conducting our&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/meetup" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STACK-X series of meetups</a>,
on topics ranging from engineering practices to product sharing, through
webinars,‚Äù said Mr Kok. GovTech has engaged more than 1,000 participants
on topics such as agile development, cybersecurity and data strategy over
10 STACK-X meetups since 2019.</p>
<p>In May, it hosted an online ‚ÄúCovid-19 Idea Sprint‚Äù to seek ideas and prototypes
that solve problems caused by the pandemic. About 330 people from the public
and businesses participated and submitted over 70 proposals, which offered
solutions such as designing wearables for contact tracing and developing
personal risk scores based on proximity data.</p>
<p>To encourage public-private partnerships, government agencies are increasingly&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/big-push-for-ai-proves-fruitful-and-useful" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sharing the source codes</a>&nbsp;of their digital products for industry
developers to experiment with and build their own versions.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, GovTech developed
VigilantGantry, a video analytics solution powered by artificial intelligence
that automatically screens people‚Äôs temperatures when they pass through
a gantry or entrance.</p>
<p>Using a regular video camera and thermal scanner, the software can detect
and screen the temperatures of those wearing caps or items that cover their
foreheads. Mr Lim Kian Boon, deputy director of video analytics at GovTech,
said: ‚ÄúVigilantGantry‚Äôs thermal scanner is designed to be modular so that
companies can easily adapt and incorporate the technology to existing infrastructure,
such as gated entrances.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe hope that the private sector will use the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dsaidgovsg/vigilantgantry" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">source codes</a>&nbsp;to
scale and deploy to sites across Singapore.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Many ways to contribute</h3>
<p>Covid-19 has highlighted the importance of having&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/early-tech-push-eases-covid-19-impact" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">digital capabilities that enable the country to adapt to challenges.</a>&nbsp;To
nurture a vibrant tech ecosystem, the Government is improving the engineering
capabilities of public agencies and encouraging the public to contribute
to Singapore‚Äôs Smart Nation project.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are stepping up our recruitment efforts to fill over 400 active vacancies
for software engineers, cybersecurity specialists, data scientists, business
analysts and infrastructure specialists,‚Äù said Mr Kok, adding that more
than 600 talents were engaged through tech hunts held in June.</p>

<p>Citizens can also become&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/resources/scope/smart-nation-ambassador---faq" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation Ambassadors</a>&nbsp;to
help collect feedback on government agencies‚Äô digital services and teach
others, especially senior citizens, basic digital skills, such as how to
connect to Wi-Fi hotspots and personalise accessibility tools on their
mobile devices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can also join us as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/tech-kaki-community/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tech Kakis</a>&nbsp;to

</p>
<p>He noted that the Government‚Äôs ongoing digital transformation is key to
a better future for all. ‚ÄúMany say that we are in the ‚Äònew normal‚Äô, but
I would like to think that we are in the ‚Äònew possible‚Äô, where today‚Äôs
circumstances have created new digitalisation possibilities in the way
we live, work and transact,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe want to hem in these new possibilities to create a more digitally
empowered nation and redefine the future of government operations and services
in Singapore. By humanising the front end, engaging the community and modernising
the back end, we will re-engineer the Government‚Äôs operating system to
create better services for citizens and businesses.‚Äù</p>
