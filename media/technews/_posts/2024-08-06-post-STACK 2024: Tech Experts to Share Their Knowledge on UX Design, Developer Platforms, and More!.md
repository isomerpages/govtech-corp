an independent open-source developer currently based in Singapore. He is
the author and team lead of two highly influential projects in the web
frontend and JavaScript ecosystem: <a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Vue.js</u></a> and <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Vite</u></a>. Evan’s contributions have significantly
shaped modern web development and transformed the way developers build
user interfaces, making him a pivotal figure in the open-source community.</p>
<h4>A Journey of Innovation and Impact</h4>
<p>Evan began his career at Google Creative Labs in New York before becoming
a core developer at Meteor, an open-source JavaScript framework startup.
In 2014, he created Vue.js as a personal side project and by 2016, he dedicated
himself full-time to his own open-source projects like Vue.js. This leap
culminated in the rise of Vue.js as one of the most widely used frontend
frameworks, and the creation of Vite in 2020, a cutting-edge building tool.</p>
<h4>Sustainability and Independence</h4>
<p>Vue.js stands out as a mainstream framework that remains independent,
and not owned by a single corporation. This independence is crucial as
it ensures that technical decisions are made in the users' best interests.</p>
