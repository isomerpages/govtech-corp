And that‚Äôs why some of us use ad blockers to minimise the number of annoying ads that get in the way of going online.</p><p>But ad blockers are underrated scam protectors as well, sieving out fraudulent online ads that can be hard to distinguish from legitimate ones.</p><p>Read on to find out more about how such tools can protect your online activity and keep you and your money safe.</p><h3>Scams ‚Äì a growing scourge</h3><p>Scam victims in Singapore lost just over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scam-victims-in-s-pore-lost-6607-million-in-2022-almost-13-billion-in-past-two-years" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">$660 million in 2022</a>, up more than 4 per cent from the previous year.</p><p>And if you think most of the victims are the elderly, who are typically less digitally savvy, think again. More than half the number of scam victims were between 20 and 39 years old, with most of them duped by job scams.</p><p>Other common types of scams include phishing, e-commerce, investment, social media impersonation, fake friend calls, loans, internet love, credit for sex, and fake gambling platform scams.</p><h3>How ad blockers can protect you</h3><p>As you can see, many of these scams involve malicious actors posing as a harmless organisation or individuals.</p><p>Ad blockers can guard against many of these scams. As its name suggests, ad blockers prevent ads from appearing when you are surfing the internet. Many scams that are posing as innocuous ads will thus not cross your screen at all.</p><p>For instance, the United States‚Äô Federal Bureau of Investigation&nbsp;<a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/fbi-recommends-ad-blocker-online-scams-b1048998.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recommends</a>&nbsp;ad-blocking internet browser extensions to protect against fraudulent online ads that appear in search results. These bogus ads link to web pages that are difficult to tell apart from the official web pages of businesses.</p><p>Other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/technology/personaltech/ad-blockers-and-the-nuisance-at-the-heart-of-the-modern-web.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">benefits</a>&nbsp;of using ad blockers include faster web page load times and reduced data usage because you‚Äôre not wasting bandwidth loading ads.</p><p>Certain ad blockers can also&nbsp;<a href="https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2023/02/02/ad-blockers-could-be-helpful-for-your-privacy/59826/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">protect your privacy</a>&nbsp;by hiding your IP and encrypting your data.</p><p>Of course, as with all things, the quality of ad blockers can vary. Some of these blockers collect your data for sale. There have also been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/fake-ad-blocker-extensions-used-in-ad-fraud-scheme" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">cases of bogus ad blockers</a>&nbsp;masquerading as reputable ones. These fake blockers not only failed to carry out their purported purpose but also embroiled users in ad fraud schemes. Check if they are scams.</p><h3>ACT now to safeguard yourself</h3><p>At the end of the day, the best defence against scams is an informed citizenry that is vigilant against fraudsters. To raise awareness of the importance of anti-scam measures, the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) launched the ‚ÄúI can ACT against scams‚Äù&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncpc.org.sg/events_20230118-SCAMinar-ACT-Against-Scams-2023.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a>&nbsp;earlier in 2023, educating the public on three actions ‚Äì making up the <strong>ACT</strong> acronym ‚Äì they can take:</p><p>1) <strong>Add</strong> security features such as <a href="https://www.scamshield.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield</a> and two-factor authentication.</p><p>2) <strong>Check</strong> suspicious messages against official sources and verify if callers are indeed who they claim to be.</p><p>3) <strong>Tell</strong> the authorities about your scam encounters and inform your relatives and friends so they will be on guard.</p><h3>Prevention is better than cure</h3><p>Online activity will only become increasingly integral to our lives. While this means greater convenience and more sources of entertainment, unfortunately, this also brings about more opportunities for malicious actors.</p><p>So do the right thing and take a few simple steps to protect yourselves. Spread the word among those around you so they can take similar measures and assist those who are not as tech-savvy with anti-scam safeguards.</p><p>Together, we can make cyberspace a safer space for all.</p>
