<p>Physical obstructions and interfering devices can limit Wi-Fi coverage
in a home setting. We highlight some tips to improve your home fibre broadbandâ€™s
Wi-Fi strength and range.</p>
<p>Not getting ideal connections on your homeâ€™s wireless network? Or struggling
with Wi-Fi Bermuda Triangles and â€˜dead zonesâ€™ around the house? With our
hectic online lifestyles, trying to troubleshoot wireless connectivity
issues that crop up in the middle of an important video streaming session
is easily the most exasperating First World problem.</p>
<p>But before you set off to buy new routers, Wi-Fi extenders, or a totally
new fibre broadband network, it helps to first understand that a wireless
signal can be affected by many surrounding factors. Anything from long
distances to physical obstructions and the angle of router antennasâ€”even
an inconspicuous microwave ovenâ€”can influence your internet connection.
If youâ€™re tired of being dogged by a dodgy Wi-Fi signal, try out some of
these hacks.</p>
<h3>1. Find the ideal spot</h3>
<p>While it may seem logical to have the router inside a cabinet in an extreme
corner of the house to minimise wire clutter, that very decision could
be the root cause of your Wi-Fi woes. Ideally, the router should be located
centrally in your house and mounted high on a wall or resting on a top
shelf so as to provide coverage as evenly as possible across your home.</p>
<p>In addition, the Wi-Fi router needs an open space away from walls and
obstructions to transmit better signals and to prevent overheating. Keep
the router away from signal-interfering equipment such as cordless phones,
old Bluetooth devices and microwave ovens, as they are likely to operate
on the same frequency and cause Wi-Fi congestion. The router should also
be positioned away from reflective and metallic surfaces such as mirrors
and fish tanks, which can block Wi-Fi signals.</p>
<h3>2. Update the firmware</h3>
<p>Router manufacturers are always tweaking software for quicker data transmission
and greater coverage. They also occasionally issue firmware updates to
improve the performance of their products.</p>
<p>So even if your wireless network is not ailing, you should consider installing
regular updates, which may provide security patches and other improvements.
Some routers have built-in update processes while older models might require
you to download firmware files from the equipment manufacturer. Or you
could take things into your own hands and get the latest model of router
altogether.</p>
<h3>3. Time for an upgrade</h3>
<p>If you frequently face network-related congestion issues that cannot be
attributed to a slow broadband connection, your router might need an upgrade.
The current standard for Wi-Fi routers is 802.11ac, which uses the 5 Gigahertz
(GHz) frequency. This means they experience less interference from the
typical 2.4GHz signals emitted by older routers and appliances like microwave
ovens and support faster speeds.</p>
<p>Look out also for routers with dual-band capabilities (e.g. those that
offer both the 2.4 and 5GHz frequencies). The dual-band function keeps
newer devices that support the latest Wi-Fi standards on the higher bandsâ€”separate
from older devicesâ€”thus preventing mutual interference. New AC routers
also have advanced features such as beamforming, which detects where devices
are and intensifies the signal in their directions.</p>
<h3>4. Wi-Fi extenders</h3>
<p>If all fails, it is time to get help with additional devices. Also known
as Wi-Fi boosters or repeaters, these extenders improve Wi-Fi coverage
by receiving the wireless signals from your router and repeating them using
powerful amplifiers and antennas. Plenty of software and programmes are
available to visualise both the weak and strong Wi-Fi spots in your home
to help you figure out where to place them.</p>
<p>However, the increase in the range may come at the cost of internet speed
if the extender communicates to devices on the same band as the router.
Dual-band extenders help ease channel traffic using two Wi-Fi signals by
connecting to the router on one band and putting out a Wi-Fi signal on
the other.</p>
<h3>5. Divide and conquer</h3>
<p>An alternative to Wi-Fi extenders is mesh networking devices. A mesh network
comprises separate routers called nodes that use Wi-Fi to communicate with
each other, each providing a full Wi-Fi signal in each room they are placed
in.</p>
<p>Easy to configure, their flexibility also makes them ideal for use in
large homes with odd floorplans. That said, mesh networking systems are
more expensive than Wi-Fi extenders and multiple nodes may be required
to effectively expand Wi-Fi coverage over a large area.</p>
