<p>By now, you’re probably familiar with GoWhere and its multiple campaigns,
which are instantly recognisable by the URL&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gowhere.gov.sg/</a>.</p>
<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, GoWhere has offered intuitive location-based
search for Government campaigns, services and information. Two classic
pandemic examples are VaccineGoWhere, which was instrumental in informing
Singaporeans where to get vaccinated and ARTGoWhere, which informed the
public on where to pick up ART test kits.</p>
<p>Post-pandemic, the GoWhere team has been supporting multiple campaigns
to help Singaporeans in aspects such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Supporting heartland merchants — CDC vouchers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping Singaporeans stay active and connected to their community — Healthier
SG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fostering resilience and preparedness — SG Ready</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Helping Singaporeans support heartland merchants</h3>
<p>Since 2022, Singapore introduced the CDC (Community Development Council)
vouchers scheme to help heartland merchants. CDC vouchers are also a way
to help Singaporean households cope with daily expenses.</p>
<p>To support this campaign, the GoWhere team created&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/cdcvouchers" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CDCVouchersGoWhere</a>&nbsp;–
allowing citizens to find out where they can spend their CDC vouchers easily.</p>
<h3>Helping Singaporeans stay active and connected to their community</h3>
<p>Healthier SG is a national initiative by the Ministry of Health (MOH)
focusing on preventive health. Singaporeans can take proactive steps to
manage their health, prevent the onset of chronic diseases and have strong
support to lead healthier lifestyles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/hsgevents/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HealthierSGEventsGoWhere</a>&nbsp;was
created as a one-stop directory for community healthy lifestyle activities.
Citizens can find events such as yoga, brisk walking, HIIT, K-pop-inspired
workouts and yes, good ol’ classic line dancing.</p>
<h3>Fostering resilience and preparedness</h3>
<p>This year, GoWhere also supported the conduct of the inaugural Exercise
SG Ready via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/sgready/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SGReadyGoWhere</a>.
Held in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Total Defence, Exercise
SG Ready aimed to increase Singapore’s readiness for crises and disruptions.
Participating organisations across Singapore simulated disruptions to power,
water, food supply, and digital connectivity and conducted fire evacuation
drills during the two-week exercise period from 15 Feb 2024 to 29 Feb 2024.</p>
<p>With SGReadyGoWhere, Singaporeans could easily find out the dates, duration
and locations of these disruptions during the exercise period. At the same
time, Singaporeans can also use the SGReadyGoWhere to locate their nearest
Civil Defence shelters in the event of a wartime emergency.</p>
<h3>But here’s the thing: Managing campaigns and keeping information update-to-date was resource-intensive</h3>
<p>While users appreciate the helpfulness of GoWhere campaigns, there is
a lot of coordination and verification that goes into creating them. Behind
the scenes, the GoWhere team has to coordinate with multiple parties to
collate the information, verify, translate and thereafter publish these
campaigns/services on the site. This is especially true when accurate information
has to be updated in a timely manner.</p>
<p>In the past, this is what the GoWhere team had to do:</p>
<p>The GoWhere team had to liaise with business users, translators and internally
within the team to gather requirements and content for the campaign, build
the GoWhere site and translate the content. The GoWhere team would function
as a bridge between all these parties.</p>
<p>This old process was time-consuming and also required a lot of unnecessary
coordination. Getting a GoWhere site up takes an average of about 4 days,
and updating it can take an average of 3 days.</p>
<p>Given the demand for GoWhere websites, this process quickly became overwhelming
and was no longer effective. Business users should have the right to make
these changes on their own.</p>
<h3>DIYGoWhere – empowering users to build their own GoWhere campaign</h3>
<p>To resolve this, the GoWhere team launched DIYGoWhere, a ground-up initiative
that enables business users/agencies to self-update existing GoWhere sites
and eventually, spin up new GoWhere sites by themselves.</p>
<p>Today, DIYGoWhere features a content management system with an approval
workflow, translation request and fulfilment tracker, and user management.</p>
<p>To put it simply, DIYGoWhere promises:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>More control for business owners, allowing them to update their GoWhere
campaign sites anytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the turnaround time to launch GoWhere campaigns and updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Streamline and reduce unnecessary coordination work from all parties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unlocking the possibilities</h3>
<p>From collecting CDC vouchers to helping out with Total Defence, the&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GoWhere.gov.sg</a>&nbsp;suite of products has helped simplify various
aspects of life for Singaporeans. With the implementation of DIYGoWhere,
we’re excited to give this tool to agencies to use.</p>
