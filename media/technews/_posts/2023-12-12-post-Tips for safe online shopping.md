<p>There are just so many reasons to shop till you drop in the final months
of the year. Massive sales are held by retailers. You have to stock up
on presents for holiday gift exchanges. And surely you deserve a little
reward – handily paid for by the year-end bonus – for making it through
another 12 months.</p>
<p>And of course, it’s now easier to go on shopping sprees than ever as discount
events are increasingly happening online. But before you go click-click-clicking
(or, with the rise of mobile devices, tap-tap-tapping), bear in mind that
the heightened online shopping activity also means more opportunities for
cybercriminals to prey on unsuspecting victims.</p>
<p>Pay attention to these tips to ensure a safe online shopping experience,
so that you don’t get more than you bargained for!</p>
<h3>Stick to recognised retailers and trusted sellers</h3>
<p>One inescapable aspect of online shopping is that you can’t be entirely
sure what you bought until it’s delivered to you. To prevent nasty surprises,
buy from the official portals of brands.</p>
<p>If you prefer shopping on e-commerce platforms that carry a variety of
goods, choose reputable ones that have tie-ups with major merchants. These
platforms usually offer official microsites of brands so that you are assured
of getting the real deal.</p>
<p>This is not to say that smaller, lesser-known retailers cannot be trusted.
It simply means that more time needs to be spent on thoroughly reading
product and store reviews, as well as checking the number of times the
item has been bought.</p>
<p>Doing your deal diligence greatly increases your chances that when it
comes to your online shopping, what you see (in the form of photos and
videos) is what you get (when your purchase is delivered).</p>
<h3>Watch out for unusual payment processes</h3>
<p>Paying for your online purchases usually involves a standard process of
keying in your credit card details on a secured channel. Scammers try to
circumvent this by directing you away to portals that they control. For
example, such sellers may send you links claiming that you need to click
on them and perform extra steps to complete your purchase. You are then
directed to a bogus payment site that will capture your card details for
nefarious uses.</p>
<p>Clicking on such links can even cause malware to be downloaded to your
phone. If you see an unrecognised app appearing on your device, do not
ignore it! It is likely to be malware. One victim&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/top-five-scams-in-singapore-and-how-to-protect-yourself" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lost more than $40,000</a>&nbsp;of
his CPF savings after he tried to buy seafood online and ended up getting
malware on his phone in the form of an app.</p>
<p>If you suspect that your device has been infected by malware, turn on
flight mode immediately to prevent scammers from accessing your information
and accounts. Perform anti-virus and anti-malware scans, and do a factory
reset for good measure.</p>
<h3>Never tell anyone your OTP</h3>

</p>
<p>OTPs, or one-time passwords, are an important form of two-factor authentication
used for logins and payments to ensure that it’s really you who’s performing
the action, instead of someone who’s gotten hold of your username and password
or payment details.</p>
<p>So alarm bells should go off if anyone asks for your OTP. Authentic sellers
and customer service officers know better than to ask for it, so if they
do, it’s a dead giveaway that they are malicious actors, no matter how
professional or helpful they sound.</p>
<p>Requesting for your OTP is a common tactic that cuts across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamalert.sg/scam-signs-otp-requests" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">different kinds</a>&nbsp;of
scams, so watch out for this!</p>
<h3>Update your apps and device’s operating system</h3>

</p>
<p>Cybercriminals are always probing for security vulnerabilities in our
devices and the apps that are installed on them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, phone manufacturers and app developers alike periodically
release new versions of their software to plug such gaps. However, these
updates are useless if they are not downloaded and installed by you, the
user.</p>
<p>This is one of the easiest steps you can take to improve your digital
security, so be sure to keep up with your updates and not let those notifications
of new releases be neglected.</p>
<h3>Choose the credit card over the debit card</h3>
<p>Debit and credit cards function in much the same way except for one crucial
difference: funds are immediately deducted from your account when debit
cards are used, whereas transactions for credit cards are not due right
away.</p>
<p>This gives banks precious time to investigate possible fraudulent transactions
and reverse the charges if needed.</p>
<h3>Keep calm and carry on</h3>
<p>Ultimately, scams prey on a basic emotion – fear. Whether it’s the fear
of missing out on a good deal or the fear that you won’t receive your shopping,
scammers want to keep you in a heightened state of anxiety.</p>
<p>So if you feel a welling up of emotion while online shopping, take a step
back and ask yourself: Is there anything strange about the situation? Am
I being made to feel a false sense of urgency so that I throw caution to
the wind? Am I letting my guard down because I just have to grab that awesome
deal? Remember,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/anyone-can-become-a-scam-victim" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">anyone can be a scam victim</a>,
even the internet savvy.</p>
<p>If you sense any of these feelings, keep calm and remind yourself – there
are so many online sales nowadays that even if you miss out on this one,
the next one’s just around the corner. Happy shopping!</p>
