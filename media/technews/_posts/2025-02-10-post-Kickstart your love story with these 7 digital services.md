<p>Valentine‚Äôs Day is just around the corner!</p>
<p>That means it‚Äôs the season for expensive chocolates, flowers, and fully-booked
restaurants. That‚Äôs all good, but as any married couple will tell you,
making a love story go the distance will definitely take a lot more than
that.</p>
<p>Think effort, commitment, and lots of hard work. Thankfully, these days,
there are plenty of digital services around to make life a little easier
for loved ones.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we're sharing our top recommendations for couples this
Valentine‚Äôs Day.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>1. Get intellectually stimulated with the NLB mobile app</h3>
<p>Ah, the library ‚Äì one of the first places that young Singaporeans go on
a date. It‚Äôs air-conditioned, has a large collection of books ‚Äì and it‚Äôs,
of course, free. Here‚Äôs the thing: libraries have plenty to offer a relationship
long after the honeymoon period. Nurture your relationship through shared
interests with the <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/services/faqs/NLB-Mobile" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Library Board</a> app.
Borrow books and audiovisual materials that spark conversations, plan cultural
dates, and attend events together.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a unique way to bond and grow as a couple ‚Äì remember, staying intellectually
compatible is a big part of being romantically compatible!</p>
<p>Download the <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/services/faqs/NLB-Mobile" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NLB mobile app.</a>
</p>
<p><em>Ps: If you borrow ebooks, you don‚Äôt need to worry about returning them late. That‚Äôs one way to avoid arguing about fines!</em>
</p>
<h3>2. Never lose your way again with NParks NEAR</h3>
<p>Singapore has a huge range of public parks, thanks to NParks. That means
plenty of green spaces for couples to unwind after a long week of work.
Take a long stroll amongst nature or hop on a bicycle and see where the
paths take you. <a href="https://pcn.nparks.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NParks Park Connector Network</a> has
over 380km of trails, and there‚Äôs no better way to explore all of them
than via the <a href="https://pcn.nparks.gov.sg/the-pcn-experience/near/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NParks Explore A Route (NEAR)</a> app.</p>
<p>This augmented reality (AR)-enabled application will enhance your bonding
experiences by overlaying interactive, informative content on the real-world
environment. Learn and get entertained while being on the move!</p>
<p>For those who‚Äôre afraid of getting lost (and partners losing their tempers),
a key feature of NEAR is an interactive map, which enables users to navigate
and explore the PCN and various trails. This includes detailed route information,
points of interest, and distance markers, encouraging discovery and exploration.</p>
<p>Explore the <a href="https://pcn.nparks.gov.sg/the-pcn-experience/near/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NEAR </a>app
with your partner.</p>
<h3>3. Get your relationship moving with MyTransport</h3>
<p>When it comes to love, showing up is important. But showing up on <em>time </em>is
equally, if not more important. It‚Äôs not a good idea to keep your partner
waiting in the sweltering Singapore heat.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs where the MyTransport app comes in.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/getting_around/public_transport/plan_your_journey.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyTransport</a>&nbsp;lets
you check for real-time updates on public transport services: Check bus
arrival timings, train schedules, and service disruptions to ensure smooth
and efficient journeys.</p>
<p>Use it to minimise waiting times at the bus stop, and save some money
instead of taking a taxi or a ride-hail.</p>
<h3>4. Keep fit together with ActiveSG</h3>
<p>Feel like the relationship is getting a little stagnant? Maybe it‚Äôs time
to liven things up with an active lifestyle. Why? Engaging in physical
activities together and having shared goals are great ways for couples
to stay together. Here‚Äôs the thing: Fitness is a continuous project; and
the work never ends.</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs why you need ActiveSG. Stay in shape together with the many&nbsp;
<a href="https://activesg.gov.sg/home" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ActiveSG</a>&nbsp;facilities across the island ‚Äì at a fraction of what
private gyms or operators charge! Things you can do together includes classic
favourites like badminton, swimming, or hitting the gym. But there are
also programmes that you can sign up for that feature more niche sports.
Think archery, belly dancing, or even pickleball.</p>
<p><em>(PS: You can also hold each other accountable to good fitness habits by downloading the <a href="https://www.lumihealth.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LumiHealth </a>app and levelling up your health together.)</em>
</p>
<h3>5. Prepare to settle down together with MyNiceHome</h3>
<p>In Singapore, asking someone to buy a HDB together is the equivalent of
a marriage proposal. That‚Äôs why you know things are getting serious when
your partner tells you to check out&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.mynicehome.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyNiceHome</a> website.</p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre choosing to BTO or buy a resale flat, you can find information
about grants, loans, renovation tips and more. This makes it a treasure
trove for those getting their flat for the first time.</p>
<p>Remember, buying a flat will probably be one of the largest financial
commitments Singaporeans make in their lifetime, so it‚Äôs important for
couples to get educated on this!</p>
<h3>6. Seal the deal with Our Marriage Journey</h3>
<p>For couples planning to take their commitment to the next level, the
<a href="https://www.marriage.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Our Marriage Journey</a>&nbsp;portal is a game-changer. The new Registry
of Marriages (ROM) portal simplifies the process of filing for marriage
online via Singpass, making the journey to your big day a little less fuss-free.</p>

administrative necessities. The portal is a comprehensive guide for all
things related to marriage in Singapore, offering an array of tools and
information to support couples in every step of their marriage journey.
