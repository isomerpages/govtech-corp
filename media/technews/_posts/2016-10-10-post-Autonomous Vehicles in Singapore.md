<h3>What are Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)?</h3>
<p>Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars or driverless cars,
are vehicles equipped with advanced technologies that allow them to navigate
and operate with minimal human intervention. These vehicles use a combination
of sensors, cameras, radar, complex algorithms and software to perceive
their environment â€” like interpreting traffic conditions and surrounding
obstacles â€” and make decisions in real time.</p>
<p>Car trivia: The word â€˜automobile,â€™ coined in the late 19th century, is
a fusion of the Greek word, autos, meaning â€˜selfâ€™, and the French word,
mobile, for â€˜movingâ€™.</p>
<p>Yet, the automobile never truly lived up to its name of being a self-moving
entity, always requiring a driver at the steering wheel.</p>
<p>Until today, where AVs exist.</p>
<p>Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan has been testing a prototype AV
since 2013, while earlier this year, in March 2016, the Korean government
granted a temporary license plate to its first driverless car, a Hyundai
Genesis.</p>
<p>To stay ahead of the curve in urban mobility, Singapore has started testing
AVs on its roads since 2011.</p>
<p>Recently, MIT technology startup <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/startup-nutonomy-driverless-taxi-service-singapore-0324" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nuTonomy</a> launched
its first-in-the-world public robo-taxi trial within the one-north research
district.</p>
<p>This is one example of Singaporeâ€™s ongoing efforts to test-drive AVs in
regular traffic.</p>
<p>As Singapore gears up towards a driverless future, we can look forward
to seeing more of these self-driving cars in our neighbourhoods.</p>
<h3>Here are three other locations in Singapore where AVs have hit the tarmac.</h3>
<h4>1. Auto Riders at Gardens by the Bay</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p><em>Image taken from <a href="https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/content/dam/gbb-2021/documents/media-room/2019/auto-rider-annex-A.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Gardens by the Bay</u></a>.</em>
</p>
<p>Singaporeâ€™s Gardens by the Bay, world-renowned for its iconic Super Trees
and giant climate-controlled domes, also houses <a href="https://www.stengg.com/en/newsroom/news-releases/st-engineering-unveils-new-on-demand-autonomous-shuttle-service-at-gardens-by-the-bay/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Asiaâ€™s first fully operational self-driving vehicle</u></a>.
Deployed as part of the Gardensâ€™ outdoor tours, the driverless Auto Riders
ply a fixed route and allow visitors to cover more ground of the sprawling
101-hectare attraction for a small fee of S$5.</p>
<p>Manufactured in Europe and modified by Singapore-based ST Engineering,
the auto riders are customised for optimal performance under local weather
conditions and the mixed traffic environment of the gardens.</p>
<p>Acting as the vehicleâ€™s â€˜eyesâ€™, cameras at its front and back work together
with a laser scanning system to help the auto rider identify its own position
relative to other objects, adjusting its course appropriately. Under wet
weather conditions when visibility might be poor, radio frequency identification
(RFID) technology is also used to assist navigation.</p>
<p>To ensure the smoothness of the ride and the safety of its ten passengers,
an on-board processing technique known as navigation technology sensor
fusion acts as the Auto Riderâ€™s â€˜brainâ€™, deciding which sensor input is
more reliable under changing circumstances.</p>
<h4>2. NAVIAs at Nanyang Technological University</h4>

</div>
<p>Nanyang Technological Universityâ€™s (NTU) Energy Research Institute at
NTU (ERI@N) is also actively engaged in AV research in collaboration with
French startup Induct Technologies and JTC Corporation.</p>
<p>Boasting not one but two electric AVs called <a href="https://www.asianscientist.com/2013/08/tech/ntu-jtc-navia-first-electric-autonomous-vehicle-2013/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>NAVIAs</u></a>,
each vehicle can carry eight passengers at a time and travel at a maximum
speed of 20.1 km/h, employing laser sensors and cameras for navigation.</p>
<p>The NAVIAs are occasionally deployed as a shuttle service exclusive to
staff and students of ERI@N, traversing a stretch of road between the Clean
Tech Park and NTU.</p>
<p>This route is set to be expanded in the second half of 2017 with the opening
of a dedicated 1.8-hectare test circuit under the Centre of Excellence
for Testing and Research of AVs-NTU (CETRAN).</p>
<p>At the same time, the NTU researchers are working on greater battery capacity
and fast-charging ports, which are essential if electric Autonomous Vehicles
are to become a mainstream mode of land transportation in Singapore.</p>
<h4>3. SCOT at the National University of Singapore</h4>
<p>The Shared Computer Operator Transport, or SCOT, is the brainchild of
the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore-MIT Alliance
for Research and Technology (SMART).</p>
<p>Modified from a Mitsubishi i-Miev, SCOT (top photo) has been fitted with
cost-efficient laser sensors and cameras, enabling it to operate independently
from the Global Positioning System (GPS).</p>
<p>This is especially critical when travelling in underground tunnels where
GPS signals may be weak.</p>
<p>On a full charge, which takes between six to eight hours, SCOT is capable
of traversing 100-130 km at a maximum autonomous speed of 25 km/h. The
driverless car might be spotted on test drives around the NUS campus and
one north, though as of now, members of the public canâ€™t tag along for
the ride just yet.</p>
<p>According to its inventors, SCOT was developed specifically to solve the
â€˜first- and last-mileâ€™ problem in urban environments â€” the commute from
your doorstep to the nearest main public transportation network (e.g. the
MRT station), and the commute from where you alight the transportation
network to your final destination.</p>
<p>If SCOT were to hit the roads someday, it may become a viable alternative
to walking and cycling, the current de facto solution to the first-and
last-mile problem.</p>
