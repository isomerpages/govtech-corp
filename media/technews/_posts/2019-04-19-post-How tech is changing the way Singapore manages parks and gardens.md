<p>Find out how technology is changing the way parks and gardens are maintained
and start learning more about our green spaces through mobile apps.</p>
<p>With a global reputation for being a biophilic City in a Garden, Singapore
goes to great lengths to balance nature and rapid urbanisation. Built-up
as the city state may be, it boasts more than 3,347 hectares of nature
reserves, six million trees, and more than 350 parks and gardens scattered
across the island.</p>
<p>The National Parks Board (NParks), a statutory board of the Government
of Singapore, is responsible for maintaining and growing these natural
spaces over the years. Going beyond simply setting aside areas for the
conservation of flora and fauna, NParks seeks to integrate greenery into
urban landscapes, building on a vision to transform Singapore into a biophilic
city.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBiophilic means that people and nature are always in close proximity.
In the past, buildings were buildings, and parks were parks. That line
is increasingly being blurred as we continue our efforts to green our city,‚Äù
said Mr Shee Zhi Qiang, director of horticulture and operations at the
Singapore Botanic Gardens.</p>
<p>Technology is critical in NParks‚Äô mission, and TechNews found out how
digitalisation, data and even drones are helping to protect and promote
nature in Singapore.</p>

<h3>Inspection &amp; Maintenance</h3>
<p><strong>Resistograph</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the tallest trees in the Singapore Botanic Gardens‚Äîthe Jelawi tree
(Terminalia subspathulata King)‚Äîstands at 47 metres and is more than 150
years old! While plants are regarded as potentially immortal, they can
be infected by pests and diseases that may compromise their structural
integrity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne tool that we‚Äôve been using to detect decay in trees is called the
resistograph. This is a machine that drills into the tree and measures
the resistance of the wood,‚Äù said Mr Shee. By comparing the measured resistance
profile to a reference profile for the species of tree, NParks officers
can determine whether a tree is structurally sound.</p>

<p><strong>Drones</strong>
</p>
<p>To carry out tree inspections, arborists may have to climb to great heights.
While many officers may enjoy this aspect of their job, it is time-consuming
and comes with its inherent risks. Instead, NParks is now deploying aerial
drones equipped with digital cameras to assess even the uppermost branches
of trees.</p>
<p>The tree inspection microdrone, developed in collaboration with the Singapore
University of Technology and Design, is providing NParks with live video
streams for officers to evaluate tree health. This serves as a first step
in the tree inspection regime. NParks is also working with the Civil Aviation
Authority of Singapore and other government agencies to explore the use
of drones for monitoring forest fires.</p>

<p><strong>Robotic grass mower</strong>
</p>
<p>The sprawling lawns in many of Singapore‚Äôs parks and gardens require trimming
on a regular basis. Helping to reduce the reliance on manpower for this
laborious task are the robotic grass mowers that automatically make their
rounds daily‚Äîlike Roombas, but with blades.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have 15 of these robots deployed in the Singapore Botanic Gardens
itself. They cut the grass silently every night while we sleep, leaving
the lawns free for public to enjoy during the day. An added benefit is
that we don‚Äôt have to clear up the grass clippings because the amount being
trimmed every day is kept minimal,‚Äù explained Mr Shee.</p>

<h3>Database &amp; Analytics</h3>
<p><strong>Mobile field app</strong>
</p>
<p>In the past, NParks officers keyed in their field observations and data
into devices that were not connected to the internet, which meant that
it had to be docked back at the office before information could be transferred
and analysed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow, our officers use a mobile field app on a tablet and the data is
automatically updated to our own internal database. Since most people are
familiar with using tablets and other mobile devices, there was very minimal
training required to adopt the new system,‚Äù said Shee.</p>
<p><strong>MAVEN</strong>
</p>
<p>With more diverse data sources and greater data complexity, the integration
of data sets will allow NParks to obtain deeper insights about Singapore‚Äôs
green spaces. This is made possible by MAVEN, a common geospatial information
system co-developed by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech)
allowing data from satellites, field operations, public feedback, and flora
and fauna sightings to be overlaid on a map of Singapore.</p>
<p>‚ÄúData gathered by external agencies like the Urban Redevelopment Authority
or Land Transport Authority is also included, thereby facilitating inter-agency
planning,‚Äù Mr Shee noted.</p>
<p><strong>Modelling</strong>
</p>
<p>If the resolution of data is high enough, NParks officers can even create
models and run simulations of individual trees. For example, using Light
Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) scan of a tree, officers can generate a model
to predict tree behaviour under different weather conditions. Such models
could be immensely useful when scheduling tree pruning and other garden
or park maintenance activities.</p>
<h3>Nature Conservation &amp; Citizen Science</h3>
<p><strong>Camera traps</strong>
</p>
<p>Animals and birds are part of Singapore‚Äôs natural ecosystems. By tracking
their populations and movements in the wild, conservation efforts can be
adapted accordingly. Camera traps are therefore an indispensable part of
wildlife monitoring as they provide information about how wildlife use
their native environment, which would not be available through other means.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor instance, we can use camera traps to learn how the animals are using
the eco-links over the highway roads to cross over to the other side safely,‚Äù
said Mr Shee.</p>
<p><strong>Underwater drones and sensors</strong>
</p>
<p>The sea surrounding Singapore is rich in biodiversity, and NParks plays
an important role in managing our coastal and marine areas. Mr Shee highlighted
that underwater drones are being used to investigate dugong feeding trails,
while underwater sensors are gathering data on oceanic circulation and
coral dispersal.</p>
<h3>SGBioAtlas</h3>
<p>Caring for nature cannot be left to the authorities alone. Hence, NParks
is using mobile apps to educate citizens about nature and get them involved
in conservation efforts. The SGBioAtlas app, free to download from the
App Storeor Google Play Store, allows citizens to take photos of flora
and fauna around Singapore and submit those images to NParks for identification.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a win-win situation because not only do citizens learn about
the organisms sharing their environment, but at the same time, NParks gathers
data about the location and frequency of interesting sightings,‚Äù Mr Shee
explained.</p>
<p><strong>trees.sg</strong>
</p>
<p>Finally, nature lovers can also visit <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/trees" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">trees.sg</a> to find out the scientific
and common names of trees planted in their neighbourhoods, as well as details
about the dimensions, carbon content, pruning schedules of each tree. Developed
together with GovTech, the trees.sg database contains data on more than
500,000 urban trees and is synchronised with MAVEN, making it easy for
both the public and NParks officers to access up-to-date information.</p>
