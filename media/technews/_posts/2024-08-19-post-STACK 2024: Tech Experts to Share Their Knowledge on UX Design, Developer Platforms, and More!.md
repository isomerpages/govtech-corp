<h3>1. Evan You: A Developer that’s Transforming the Web Development Landscape</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Evan You at STACK 2024" src="/images/technews/Evan_You_600x300.png">
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanyou/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Evan You</a>&nbsp;is
an independent open-source developer currently based in Singapore. He is
the author and team lead of two highly influential projects in the web
frontend and JavaScript ecosystem:&nbsp;<a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://vitejs.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Vite</a>. Evan’s contributions have significantly
shaped modern web development and transformed the way developers build
user interfaces, making him a pivotal figure in the open-source community.</p>
<h4>A Journey of Innovation and Impact</h4>
<p>Evan began his career at Google Creative Labs in New York before becoming
a core developer at Meteor, an open-source JavaScript framework startup.
In 2014, he created Vue.js as a personal side project and by 2016, he dedicated
himself full-time to his own open-source projects like Vue.js. This leap
culminated in the rise of Vue.js as one of the most widely used frontend
frameworks, and the creation of Vite in 2020, a cutting-edge building tool.</p>
<h4>Sustainability and Independence</h4>
<p>Vue.js stands out as a mainstream framework that remains independent,
and not owned by a single corporation. This independence is crucial as
it ensures that technical decisions are made in the users' best interests.</p>
<h4>What to Expect from Evan's Talk</h4>
<p>Evan You's contributions to the web development landscape through Vue.js
and Vite have been monumental. His dedication to open-source principles
and community support ensures that Vue.js and Vite will remain at the forefront
of web development for years to come. As a keynote speaker, Evan offers
invaluable insights into the future of web technologies, making his talks
helpful for anyone interested in the evolution of the web development landscape.</p>
<h3>2. Gregor Hohpe: Architecting Transformation for the Cloud Era</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Gregor Hohpe at STACK 2024" src="/images/technews/Gregor_Hohpe_600x300.png">
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghohpe/?originalSubdomain=sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Gregor Hohpe</a>&nbsp;is
a tech strategist, engineer, author, speaker, and a former GovTech Smart
Nation Fellow. As an architect, he has explored and studied the complex
world of IT architecture for over two decades. His experience spans diverse
organisations – from Silicon Valley startups to established enterprises
like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google, ensuring successful digital
transformation in these organisations.</p>
<h4>A Global Authority on Architecture</h4>
<p>Gregor's expertise is recognised worldwide. He co-authored the seminal
book&nbsp;<a href="https://architectelevator.com/book/#eip:~:text=The%20Classic%3A%20Enterprise%20Integration%20Patterns" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Enterprise Integration Patterns (2003)</a>,
a cornerstone reference for&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/enterprise-service-bus/#:~:text=application%20integration%20requirements%3F-,What%20is%20Enterprise%20Service%20Bus%3F,%2C%20protocols%2C%20and%20security%20restrictions." rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs)</a>.
His follow-up,&nbsp;<a href="https://architectelevator.com/book/#:~:text=writing%20this%20way.-,The%20Software%20Architect%20Elevator,-Being%20an%20architect" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Software Architect Elevator (2020)</a>,
delves into real-world IT transformation challenges. His articles have
also been featured in prestigious publications like&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4302-0038-3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Best Software Writing</a>&nbsp;by
Joel Spolsky and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596800611/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know</a>.</p>
<h4>From Buzzwords to Actionable Strategies</h4>
<p>Gregor is known for his ability to translate complex concepts into practical
solutions. He actively dismantles "buzzwords" and replaces them with clear,
actionable strategies. His passion lies in helping technology leaders bridge
the divide between the “engine room” (technical details) and the “penthouse”
(business strategy).</p>
<h4>Transforming Singapore's Smart Nation</h4>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-smarter-nation-speeding-up-more-than-going-faster-hohpe/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">former Smart Nation Fellow</a> for
the Singapore government, Gregor played a pivotal role in accelerating
government IT processes. He understands the unique challenges faced by
public sector organisations and offers practical solutions for navigating
rapid change while maintaining security and efficiency.</p>
<h4>What to Expect from Gregor’s Talk</h4>
<p>Learn about the magic of developer platforms and how they defy the IT
laws of physics:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Platforms spur innovation despite harmonisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platforms speed up development while assuring compliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Platforms reduce cognitive load without restricting choice</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But building such an in-house platform, or even deploying one, is far
from easy. Gregor packages his experience in building platforms into a
series of mental models and metaphors that will help you understand design
decisions and trade-offs. You'll also find out how platforms are related
to cars, submarines, and fruit salads!</p>
