<p>Cloud computing has revolutionised the way digital applications are being
developed.</p>
<p>Mr Gregor Hohpe, former technical director in Google Cloud’s office of
the CTO, highlighted the importance of replaceability, resilience and requirements
in cloud deployments, as well as the changing roles and responsibilities
of cloud architects.</p>
<p>In the past, being an architect meant planning and designing buildings
for people to live, work, and play in. Fast-forward to our modern, digitalised
world, and a different breed of architect has emerged. Rather than dabble
in physical spaces, these new-age builders and developers deal with IT
systems and software, creating applications in the virtual realm that are
disrupting the way we do things online and offline.</p>
<p>Cloud computing architecture, like the plumbing and electrical wiring
that runs through cities, is now almost essential for most organisations
to run their day-to-day operations—just think about the unprecedented efficiency
and convenience provided by data storage applications like Google Drive
and Dropbox. But more than a ubiquitous hard disk drive, the Cloud has
become a bedrock for innovation, allowing governments, businesses and individuals
to create, test, deploy and scale their ideas for digital applications.</p>
<p>“From day one, we really saw Cloud as an innovation platform. It wasn’t
an infrastructure retrofit; it was something that would change the way
we build software,” said Mr Gregor Hohpe, cloud architect and former technical
director in Google Cloud’s office of the CTO. He delivered a keynote speech
about ‘What it means to be an architect in the cloud era’ at the STACK-X:
Cloud seminar organised by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore
(GovTech).</p>

<h3>Best practices in cloud architecture</h3>
<p>When thinking about cloud architecture, Mr Hohpe suggested three ‘R’s
that would help guide decisions—replaceability, resilience and requirements.</p>
<p>Replaceability basically refers to the ability to substitute one component
of a cloud IT system with another or to reroute traffic to another online
service without consequence. Think of this as having spare parts for an
engine. Meanwhile, resilience means that if one component of the system
fails, there should not be a domino effect on everything else connected
to that component.</p>
<p>Last but not least is requirements, and this is where the finesse of an
architect really shows, said Mr Hohpe. “As an architect, nobody is going
to bring you a requirements list of things you need to do,” he quipped.
Instead, what architects usually need to figure out for themselves is the
context of the cloud IT system they are working on, alongside all the assumptions
and dependencies that come along with it.</p>
<p>“These are sort of implicit requirements that people expect to have but
almost never articulate,” he said. Hence, an architect in the cloud era
needs to understand the nuances of the applications they are building so
as to deliver value to their end users.</p>
<h3>New roles and responsibilities</h3>
<p>Once the three ‘R’s have been established, the primary advantage offered
by cloud computing is flexibility in the amount of compute resources an
organisation has at its disposal, said Mr Hohpe. Prior to the availability
of cloud computing, software developers had to ‘begin with the end in mind’,
so to speak, and factor in the hardware and computing specifications prior
to initiating a project.</p>
<p>“You needed to do the infrastructure hardware sizing up front [because]
you don’t know exactly how much resources your application will need,”
Mr Hohpe noted. “With the cloud, you can defer that decision, and once
your application is running, you have the option to scale up or down [the
amount of compute resources accordingly].”</p>
<p>In addition, the Cloud offers elastic costing—commercial cloud service
providers follow a ‘pay as you use’ model, where the architect is able
to pick and choose from the myriad of services available. “This means architects
have a new responsibility in controlling costs [associated with application
development],” Mr Hohpe said, though he cautioned overzealous developers
against falling for the ‘grocery store phenomenon’.</p>
<p>“At the grocery store, everything you buy costs just two or three dollars,
but at the cashier, the final bill may amount to a hundred dollars [without
you even realising it],” he explained. Therefore, cloud architects need
to be more discerning in their choice of features to include in their cloud
applications.</p>
