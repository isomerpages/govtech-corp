For tech companies and professionals in the know, the upcoming Smart Nation Industry Briefing is a crystal ball cum barometer of the Government's ICT roadmap for the year ahead.

Last year, the event — under the auspices of IDA — was attended by close to 900 participants from businesses, trade associations and Government, including representatives from many tech SMEs.

Now organised by GovTech, this year's Smart Nation Industry Briefing will cover upcoming ICT initiatives, partnership opportunities and key ICT projects by Government agencies.

If you have not attended previous Industry Briefings before, here are three reasons to sign up this ticketed* event.


**1. Latest insights on Smart Nation developments**

The briefing is where you can gleam, first hand, information on upcoming public sector Information and Communication Technology (ICT) business opportunities and areas for collaboration.

This year, the event will include a keynote speech by GovTech Chief Executive Jacqueline Poh, and five other presentations on the Smart Nation Platform,  Cybersecurity and three other agencies' (Ministry of Education,  Integrated Health Information Systems, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore) future procurement plans.

You will find out how GovTech will enable a Digital Government that places citizens at the heart of the experience, be it delivering citizen-centric services, or increasing the Government's technology capabilities to ensure that everyone benefits from a Smart Nation.


**2. Network and Connect with Peers**
The event offers an excellent opportunity to network with industry leaders, CIOs and senior public officers from Government agencies, in addition to — and we can't stress this enough — learning  more about the Government's plans to co-create better digital services to improve the lives of citizens.

You can also build new ties with fellow industry professionals and grow your personal network — who knows, you could be meeting your future business partners!


**3. IMBX is literally just next door!**
The Briefing will be held alongside imbX 2017, in the immediate neighbourhood of [CommunicAsia2017 and EnterpriseIT2017](https://www.connectechasia.com/){:target="_blank"}, making it convenient for those who involved in these trade shows.

You can actually visit imbX in the morning and join us for the Briefing in the afternoon.

We look forward to meeting you there!
