<p>When we think about <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-ways-you-are-already-using-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)</a>,
cutting-edge models, complex algorithms, and dazzling analytics usually
come to mind. However, these eye-catching aspects rely on a fundamental,
often overlooked foundation: data engineering. Without a solid data engineering
framework, AI and ML projects are like skyscrapers built on quicksand –
impressive looking but unlikely to stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Data engineering is akin to the plumbing that keeps our homes functioning.
While not as visible as the taps and showers it supports, it is crucial
for ensuring smooth operations. Similarly, data engineering ensures that
messy, raw data is cleaned, organised, and made usable. This is the foundation
that allows data scientists and analysts to create insights and build transformative
solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GovTech’s Data Engineering Practice (DP) team plays a critical role in
enabling impactful public sector projects. A prime example of this is its
partnership with the <a href="https://www.hpb.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Health Promotion Board (HPB)</a> to develop
the Population Health Data Hub (PHDH). This collaboration demonstrates
how good data engineering transforms ambitious ideas into practical tools
that drive meaningful outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Strengthening public health through data&nbsp;</h3>
<p>With the country’s population<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/s-pore-population-crosses-6-million-mark" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> hitting 6 million</a> and
continuing to climb, efforts to ensure a healthy society have become even
more urgent. HPB’s initiatives across different health domains, such as
nutrition, physical activity, mental well-being and health screening exemplify
the government’s commitment to fostering healthier lifestyles. An added
bonus: they also generate valuable data to deepen our understanding of
citizens’ lifestyles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combining information on citizens’ demographics, participation rates,
and behavioural trends can help identify citizen segments in greater need
of behaviour changes. This data allows the organisation to identify gaps
and fine-tune its strategies that promote early detection, encourage healthy
lifestyles, support smoking cessation, and nudge vaccination uptake, ultimately
enhancing community health and reducing the prevalence of preventable diseases.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Laying the groundwork for transformation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>HPB wants to make better use of the information it gathers. To do this,
the agency plans to improve its data systems and train its staff in data
handling. This will help HPB understand citizens' needs more deeply and
provide more tailored services, while still protecting people's privacy.
The goal is to boost HPB's ability to analyse data and build up its own
team of experts. The initial partnership between HPB and DP spanned six
months and focused on creating a strong data foundation for the PHDH, so
that solutions implemented would remain effective in the long term.</p>
<p>The first step was to clean and transform HPB’s raw data, applying validation
metrics defined by HPB so that the data met high standards of accuracy
and reliability. The DP team also conducted an assessment of HPB’s existing
and planned data models, identifying areas for improvement and offering
recommendations to enhance the organisation’s data architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To future-proof the system, DP developed reusable data pipeline templates
that ensured consistency across datasets. These templates not only minimised
the need for bespoke scripts for greater efficiency, but also served as
a blueprint for future data modelling efforts. In addition, the team designed
a structured testing framework that helped identify discrepancies early,
reducing errors and improving overall efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaboration was a success. It sped up the process of collecting
health screening information and allowed for more thorough and up-to-date
analysis of how health conditions relate to lifestyle choices. This gave
HPB a ready-to-use model that can handle larger and more complex sets of
information. This laid a strong foundation for the next phase.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Expanding and refining the system&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Encouraged by the success of their first engagement, HPB extended its
collaboration with GovTech’s DP team for another eight months to expand
the scope of the PHDH and enhance its capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DP team worked closely with HPB’s business teams to refine data models
and develop additional pipelines. Early and frequent engagement with stakeholders
ensured that requirements were well-understood, while proactive resolution
of discrepancies improved the quality of the final outputs. By leveraging
the templatised scripts developed in the first phase, the team was able
to scale the system more quickly and efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, the team worked closely with the Youth Preventive Service
teams on data models and the data transformation logic to ensure that data
assets produced were indeed practical for real-world use and met the needs
of end users.</p>
<p>Advanced techniques were also introduced to handle complex data scenarios.
The DP team implemented Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs), which allow
organisations to track changes in data over time without compromising historical
records. These enhancements were achieved using <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PySpark</a> functions,
ensuring that the system remained both robust and scalable.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Unlocking the potential of health data</h3>
<p>With access to more accurate and detailed information, HPB is now better
equipped to analyse population health trends, identify key risk factors,
and design targeted interventions. For example, the data hub enables the
organisation to develop preventive care strategies tailored to specific
demographics, improving the effectiveness of its programmes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits extend beyond technical capabilities. By working closely
with GovTech’s DP team, HPB staff gained valuable hands-on experience in
data architecture and data modelling processes. This collaboration not
only enhanced their technical skills but also fostered a culture of data
literacy within the organisation.</p>
<h3>Building a culture of collaboration&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The partnership between HPB and GovTech underscores the importance of
collaboration in data engineering projects. By focusing on the fundamentals
– cleaning, organising, and structuring data – GovTech’s DP team laid the
groundwork for HPB to achieve its goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Singapore continues to embrace technology to address its most pressing
challenges, the role of data engineering will only grow in importance.
Through projects like the Population Health Data Hub, GovTech and its partners
are proving that when data is managed right, the possibilities are endless.&nbsp;</p>
