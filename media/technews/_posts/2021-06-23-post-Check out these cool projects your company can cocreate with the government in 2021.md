of the pie as the government is spending up to $3.8 billion on info-communications
technology (ICT) procurement in 2021, up 10 per cent from last year.</p>

to sustain the momentum generated by past years‚Äô investments and to lock
in the digitalisation gains brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. More
than 80 per cent of the procurement opportunities are open to Small and
Medium Enterprises (SMEs), a continuation of last year‚Äôs practice when
SMEs were awarded 75 per cent of ICT contracts.</p>

<p>In the meantime, check out these areas where contracts are available.</p>
<h3>Transforming digital services</h3>
<p>About 70 per cent of the $3.8 billion ‚Äì or $2.7 billion ‚Äì will be spent
across 250 projects to transform, integrate and streamline more digital
services across different sectors to create a more digitally empowered
nation.</p>
<h3>Key projects</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority‚Äôs new&nbsp;<strong>Business Registry and Regulatory System (BR2S)</strong>&nbsp;will
be an online filing and information retrieval system that simplifies administrative
work for businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GovTech‚Äôs LifeSG app provides users with a personalised dashboard comprising
key information, upcoming appointments with government agencies, and consolidated
information on benefits and support. The LifeSG Eligibility Checker, which
helps users find eligible Government assistance or schemes without having
to navigate through multiple government websites and information, will
continue to be updated, and the&nbsp;<strong>GoBusiness platform</strong>,
which has helped more than 150 Food and Beverage establishments per month
to register for their business licences, with time savings of between 10
and 14 days in turn-around time. Developed by the Ministry of Trade and
Industry and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, the platform
will be expanded to be a go-to place for business-to-government interactions
in Singapore and provide personalised assistance and recommendations for
new and existing businesses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cloud tech to re-engineer digital infrastructure</h3>
<p>About $1.2 billion ‚Äì 44 per cent of the $2.7 billion for transforming
digital services ‚Äì will go towards cloud adoption projects as the government
is on track to have 70 per cent of eligible systems on the cloud by FY2023.</p>
<h3>Key projects</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The State Courts will streamline their processes through the&nbsp;<strong>Community Justice and Tribunals System (CJTS)</strong>&nbsp;‚Äì
an electronic online case filing and management system that enables court
users to submit their claims and documents, make payments, select their
court date, view documents submitted by the other party, and monitor their
case developments entirely online. The CJTS also offers Alternative Dispute
Resolution options such as e-Negotiation and e-Mediation that facilitate
early resolution of disputes between parties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sport Singapore and GovTech will collaborate to launch&nbsp;<strong>SmartGym</strong>,
which will capture and consolidate workout data on ActiveSG apps and websites
for citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The charity landscape is getting a digital makeover to make giving more
convenient and enable non-profit organisations to expand their digital
outreach. An&nbsp;<strong>SG Cares Digital Kampong</strong>&nbsp;platform
will be built to serve as a centralised repository of API capabilities,
the&nbsp;<strong>SG Cares</strong>&nbsp;app will be enhanced so it can
become the go-to app for giving, and the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/govtechlivechat-governmentictop6810578714728914945" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Giving.sg</a></strong>&nbsp;site
will be improved to provide comprehensive features connecting givers and
receivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common platforms such as the&nbsp;<strong>Singapore Government Technology Stack (SG Tech Stack)</strong>&nbsp;will
be used more to streamline and simplify the software development process,
helping government agencies accelerate their modernisation and digitalisation
plans. The government will invest over $100 million in SG Tech Stack in
the next two years. A key product of SG Tech Stack is SHIP-HATS, the government‚Äôs
continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform to deliver
secure, high-quality, cost-efficient digital services to citizens and businesses.
To date, 120 systems across 30 agencies are using SHIP-HATS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>
<p>Over $500 million (13 per cent of the $3.8 billion) will be spent on accelerating
the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) for the public sector. Video
analytics, natural language processing, fraud analytics and personalised
services are some areas which will see investment.</p>
<h3>Key projects</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Ministry of Education is using AI to boost efficiency in the teaching
process. The&nbsp;<strong>AI-Automated Marking System</strong>, an AI-enabled
learning tool, will integrate with existing Internet-accessible systems
such as the Student Learning Space. It will track students‚Äô learning progress
and personalise learning pathways for students to access MOE-designed/curated
learning resources, enabling them to take greater ownership of self-directed
learning. The integrated system will also provide learning analytics so
students can monitor their own learning and teachers can keep track of
their student‚Äôs progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ministry will also procure a&nbsp;<strong>Language Checker</strong>,
in the form of a browser plugin or a standalone application, to meet students‚Äô
learning needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to find out more</h3>
<p>The increase in ICT procurement spending will create more opportunities
for SMEs to support Singapore‚Äôs digitalisation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the SMEs that has been part of this journey is Simple Solution
Systems, an IT solutions provider that won the agile application development
and user experience design bulk tender for the whole-of-government. Mr
Anurax Lian, Managing Director, Simple Solution Systems, said: ‚ÄúBeing an
SME, we face very stiff competition in attracting top tech talent. The
bulk tender has enabled us to better attract, nurture and retain local
IT talent and provide a platform for career growth, widened exposure in
the public sector, and levelled the playing field for SMEs.‚Äù</p>
