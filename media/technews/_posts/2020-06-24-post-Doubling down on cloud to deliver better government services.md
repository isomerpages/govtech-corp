</p>
<p>Singapore is doubling down on its ‚Äúcloud-first‚Äù efforts to better develop
digital applications and services for citizens.</p>
<p>In late 2018, the government announced a five-year plan to migrate most
of its information technology (IT) systems from on-premise infrastructure
to the commercial cloud to speed up service delivery and improve the quality
of services for citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>Since then, it has moved more than 150 systems classified ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù
and below to the commercial cloud. This year, over $870 million of contracts
have been earmarked to double the number of systems on the commercial cloud.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of the cloud is its ability to connect a wider
ecosystem of partners, including users and developers, with government
agencies.</p>
<p>Leveraging the cloud capabilities and services of commercial cloud systems
also helps the government to develop applications and services for citizens
in a faster and more scalable way, said Mr Kevin Ng, director of Core Operations,
Development Environment and eXchange (CODEX) at the Government Technology
Agency (GovTech).</p>
<p>Government agencies can access a global ecosystem of ready-made solutions
to add advanced features to their digital services instead of trying to
create a brand-new solution from scratch. Application testing and deployment
can also be automated and done in real time, speeding up the delivery of
high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses.</p>
<h3>Ahead in the cloud</h3>

<p><em>As a centralised platform, SGTS will be able to ensure that cybersecurity and data security measures are incorporated into IT systems development.</em>
</p>
<p>Cybersecurity, government services, and cloud computing are on a centralised
platform. Hence, SGTS can ensure that cybersecurity and data security measures
are incorporated into IT systems development.</p>
<p>The Inland Revenue Interactive Network (IRIN), the main infocomm technology
(ICT) system that underpins Singapore‚Äôs tax administration and revenue
collection service is an example of how migrating to the commercial cloud
can help to improve the agility of government digital services.</p>
<p>Close to 5 million entities and 2,000 officers use IRIN annually, which
is being updated from a second- to third-generation system to improve taxpayers'
and officers' experiences.</p>
<p>The redeveloped system will be hosted on the government commercial cloud
through collaboration with GovTech, while DevOps tools and structure will
be adopted to increase automation.</p>
<p>Key changes planned for the system‚Äôs infrastructure include shifting from
its current monolithic architecture to microservices ‚Äî independent deployment
of functions and services instead of a single unit ‚Äî for scalability, agility
and reliability.</p>
<p>The redeveloped system will enable taxpayers to complete their tax obligations,
from assessment to payment, in a single sitting. Corporate taxpayers‚Äô tax
submission processes will also be simplified and more integrated with their
systems and accounting software.</p>
<p>Other systems that will be hosted on the commercial cloud include the
Infocomm Media Development Authority‚Äôs Integrated Regulatory Info System
(IRIS) and PUB‚Äôs smart water meter programme.</p>
<p>IRIS is scheduled to launch in 2021. It will eliminate the need for infocomm
and media industry players to physically submit their content for classification
and provide updates on application statuses, among other features.</p>
<p>The latter will see PUB install Singapore‚Äôs first smart water meters in
2021. PUB will be able to read household water usage readings wirelessly
and provide households with information on water-saving adjustments early
via a customer portal.</p>
<h3>Building blocks for development</h3>

</div>
<p>To support the increased use of the commercial cloud in developing government
IT systems, GovTech will enhance the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/singapore-government-tech-stack" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)</a>.</p>
<p>The centralised platform that enables quick and efficient deployment of
digital services to the government will offer a suite of services and tools
that public agencies can use to maintain application consistency and quality.</p>
<p>Mr Bernard Tan, director of Cybersecurity Consulting Services at GovTech,
added that SGTS, as a centralised platform, will be able to ensure that
cybersecurity and data security measures are incorporated into IT systems
development.</p>
<p>This is especially important with government and citizens‚Äô data stored
on commercial cloud systems.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo support end-to-end application development in the cloud, the government
adopts the security-by-design principle that builds security into every
step of the development. Furthermore, the confidentiality and integrity
of the government and citizens‚Äô data are protected via a common cybersecurity
technology stack,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMoving to the commercial cloud also allows agencies to utilise cloud-native
security services to enhance security, as well as modernise and secure
their deployment, while achieving higher resiliency through cloud-native
auto-scaling capabilities.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board‚Äôs eExam2 system is an
example of a project that will tap the SGTS, using components such as the
Secure Hybrid Integrated Pipeline (SHIP) and Hive Agile Testing Solutions
for faster and more secured development, and leverage best practices for
automated testing.</p>
<p>The eExam2 system will also be hosted on the government commercial cloud,
allowing the system to automatically adjust its capability levels to cater
to higher usage during peak examination periods.</p>
<p>SEAB has implemented electronic exams (e-exams) for oral assessments in
all language subjects since 2013. Video clips are used as stimuli to evaluate
students‚Äô oral skills. Computer-based written exams were also used for
some subjects. These e-exams are supported by SEAB‚Äôs eExam system, which
allows assessment specialists to set e-exam papers and mark them and for
students to submit answers electronically.</p>

</p>
<p>The eExam2 system is an enhanced version slated to be ready by March 2022.
It will allow teachers to better gauge students‚Äô critical thinking and
assess their application skills through the use of multimedia content,
such as videos, simulations, and interactive tasks.</p>
<p>The system will also provide more support for students with learning needs
and will be compatible with most operating systems and devices. In the
future, it could be integrated with artificial intelligence to automate
marking and generate insights to improve teaching.</p>
<h3>Robust partnerships</h3>
<p>More will be done to provide opportunities for the private sector to support
the cloud-first drive.</p>
<p>This year, GovTech awarded 17 companies in a co-development tender to&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/govt-award-up-ict-contracts" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">support public agencies embarking on agile-based projects</a>&nbsp;by
leveraging the SGTS ‚Äî with requirements to develop applications that can
be hosted on the cloud.</p>
<p>One of the companies, Ufinity, an IT solutions engineering company, welcomed
the focus on government-industry collaboration.</p>
<p>The company‚Äôs chief executive Tung Teck Lee said: ‚ÄúWe are glad to have
the continued opportunity to work collaboratively with government agencies
on various agile projects to contribute to the nation‚Äôs digital initiatives.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are also excited that small and medium-sized enterprises will have
more access to various procurement opportunities.‚Äù</p>
<p>GovTech has also outlined a broad plan to modernise application development
practices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is necessary to overcome many existing application challenges and
build capabilities required to support the delivery of our Digital Government
initiatives,‚Äù said Mr Tan Eng Pheng, assistant chief executive of GovTech‚Äôs
services group.</p>
<p>For this financial year, the agency will promote Continuous Integration
and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), where development teams frequently make
and deliver changes to applications‚Äô code to improve them and test automation
and software reusability.</p>
<p>Agencies‚Äô application tenders will also increasingly require firms to
use modern application development practices, the SHIP CI/CD platform,
and SGTS.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCompanies should keep a lookout for such opportunities to apply these
modern practices when delivering bespoke application systems for government
agencies,‚Äù said Mr Tan.</p>
