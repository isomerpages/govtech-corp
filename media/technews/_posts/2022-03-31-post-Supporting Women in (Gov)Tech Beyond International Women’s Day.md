<p>As the lead technology agency in public service, we have always strived
to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace to support innovation, which
is better unlocked by the appreciation of varying perspectives and respect
for different ideas. Part of our organic efforts has been to support women
in tech, both within GovTech and outside, including girls.</p>
<p>Last year, we were among more than 50 companies that took part in the&nbsp;
<a href="https://sgtech.org.sg/SGTECH/Web/Initiatives/SG-Women-in-Tech-Company-Pledge/SG-Women-in-Tech-Company-Pledge.aspx" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG Women in Tech Corporate Pledge</a>&nbsp;to signal our commitment to
create a conducive environment with a support system to attract, retain
and develop more women in tech. In particular, we pledged to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Drive mentorship and development of female talents to help bolster our
female tech talent pool in SG;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen awareness and knowledge of gender diversity and inclusion across
the organisation, through education and training;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a Women@GovTech employee resource group to lead and chart future
initiatives to support the development and retention of female employees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“The SG Women in Tech Corporate Pledge was made during International Women’s Day in 2021 by more than 50 tech companies. Companies pledged to address different needs and goals to ensure a conducive and supportive environment for women in tech”</em>
</p>
<p>A year on, we have fulfilled our committed actions, which set us up to
continue on this agenda more intentionally. With the formation of the Women
in (Gov)Tech Employee Resource Group (WiG ERG), led by a strong core team
of 9 in the executive committee and with the backing of 3 executive sponsors,
we are able to go further in fostering a more inclusive community at GovTech
which encourages everyone, especially women, to share their experiences
and forge strong bonds with one another.</p>

</p>
<p>For International Women’s Day 2022, we joined the world in commemorating
the occasion which bore the theme of #BreakTheBias. However, we recognise
that it would take more than pledges to overcome biases, so we have planned
several initiatives for the months ahead to help GovTechies become more
familiar with the topic of diversity &amp; inclusion and encourage personal
actions to support underrepresented communities, including women in tech.
Here are some of them:</p>
<h3>Addressing unconscious bias and its implications</h3>
<p>The ability to #BreakTheBias requires awareness of how we might prefer
a particular person or thing in an unfair way, which is normal, and recognition
that we can change for the better! Unconscious biases are assumptions made
about individuals or groups unknowingly in different contexts, and the
repercussions are differential treatments of these individuals or groups
that have been prejudiced against.</p>
<p>Did you answer the call to make a pledge to #BreakTheBias? If not, we
can still be proactive in understanding the biases we might have and be
committed to reducing biased decisions or unfair judgement, beyond the
month of March!</p>

</p>
<p>In the coming months, our WiG ERG is planning brown bag sessions and workshops
for GovTechies to learn about unconscious bias, and other concepts that
would affect GovTech’s ability to attract, recruit, develop and retain
diverse talent.</p>
<h3>Be a part of a Women in Tech community</h3>
<p>There is strength in numbers, so we urge all women in tech - and allies
- to join a community - be it one at your workplace or in the industry.
Here are some industry communities or initiatives you could join or get
involved in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.scs.org.sg/communities/women-in-technology" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Computer Society Women in Tech Chapter</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.sgwomenintech.sg/contact/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG Women in Tech</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://singapore.girlsintech.org/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Girls in Tech™ Singapore</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, membership to our own WiG ERG continues to grow, with
more activities being organised to provide support for career growth and
build a trusted internal community. One such activity is a monthly series,
‘Career Conversations’ - held virtually - featuring candid sharings by
women leaders in the public sector and industry, which was launched in
November 2021. Taking place during lunchtime on GovTech’s No-Meeting Friday,
which takes place every last Friday of the month, each session has been
well attended by female - and male - GovTechies, with encouraging feedback.</p>
<p>Let us rally for a better environment and supportive culture for women
to thrive in tech. Like what Wilem Tan, one of the executive members of
WiG ERG, shares, “Male allyship is key in pushing for the change we want
to see - a tech industry that is gender-blind.”</p>
