<h3>This Grandparents’ Day, help grandpa and grandma embrace digitalisation to keep them connected, engaged and healthy.</h3>
<p>The use of mobile apps and social media may be second nature to millennials,
but the same can’t always be said for the elderly. Having been brought
up in a world where the news was delivered on physical pages and mobile
phones were non-existent, some seniors may struggle to keep up with the
great advances in the digital realm.</p>
<p>So listen up millennials! As digital natives, you can be tech advocates
for the elderly in our midst. For a start, why not share with your grandparents
some mobile apps that could help them keep in touch with friends and family,
make their lives more convenient and keep them healthy?</p>
<p>This Grandparents’ Day, tell grandpa and grandma about the <a href="https://www.life.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Moments of Life app</a>,
the SingPass app and the ActiveSG app.</p>
<h3><strong>Cherishing Moments of Life better</strong></h3>

<p>The Moments of Life app, created by the Government Technology Agency of
Singapore (GovTech), has recently been modified to meet the needs of citizens
above 60 years old. Via the Active Ageing module of the Moments of Life,
seniors can browse listings of activities, interest groups or events suitable
for them to participate in.</p>
<p>Perhaps grandpa would like to revive his old hobby of Chinese chess? Or
maybe grandma wants to have a karaoke session with friends. There’s lots
to choose from! Then, if grandpa and grandma want to sit down for some
kopi or have a hearty meal after a good mental or physical workout, they
can use the app to access certain discounts on food and drinks.</p>

<p>Another important feature of the Moments of Life app is the embedded Merdeka
Generation e-card. With this e-card, eligible senior citizens can receive
subsidies at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GP and dental clinics,
as well as discounts at participating merchant outlets.</p>
<h3><strong>A first pass at SingPass Mobile</strong></h3>

<p>Whether your grandparents want to check their CPF balance or housing details,
they can do so from the convenience of their home using the SingPass Mobile
app. If forgetfulness or dexterity is something that you think comes with
old age, fret not! The SingPass Mobile app does not require users to key
in passwords. They can choose to use easy biometric login methods such
as fingerprints or facial recognition.</p>
<p>Even better, once logged in, grandpa or grandma can view all their essential
information at a glance, accessible with just a few taps or swipes. The
home screen will also prioritise and display government digital services
that are relevant to them.</p>
<p>For example, through the profile feature in SingPass Mobile, seniors can
have a quick overview of their Medisave account balance that is available
to meet their healthcare needs. Also, elderly who are thinking of downsizing
to a smaller house to extend their retirement funds can access the Housing
Development Board’s services via SingPass Mobile.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Be a good sport and get the ActiveSG app</strong></h3>
<p>Regular exercise is important for everyone but is especially important
for the elderly as it helps them to maintain their muscle mass and general
health. Should grandpa and grandma feel a bit lethargic and are hesitant
to leave the house, perhaps a little incentive for engaging in some fitness
activities is in order.</p>
<p>The ActiveSG app will make any millennial go green with envy—from highly-discounted
gym membership prices to 1-for-1 ActiveSG Masters Club subscription, seniors
will be hard pressed to find a reason not to get out of their seats and
onto their feet! Moreover, the ActiveSG app offers an exclusive ‘ActiveSG
Merdeka Generation package’ that has an expansive and exciting line-up
of activities like Zumba and yoga classes, ready to color up your grandparents’
social lives and keep them in the pink of health.</p>
<p>For those who love sports, don’t say #bojio—the ‘1-for-1 Grandparent and
Child ActiveSG Merdeka Generation Programme’ is meant to encourage family
bonding, allowing members from different generations to double up on the
exercise fun together!</p>
<p>So be sure to install the ActiveSG app on your grandparents’ phones and
inform them to sign up to receive S$100 to spend on fitness activities
and access to exercise facilities at community centres islandwide (only
applicable for first time users of the app)!</p>
