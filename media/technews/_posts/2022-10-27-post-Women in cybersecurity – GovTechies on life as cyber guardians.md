<p>Did you know that women make up just over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/boosting-women-in-southeast-asia-tech-sector" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">40 per cent</a>&nbsp;of
Singapore‚Äôs tech workforce, a significantly higher proportion than the
global average of a little under 30 per cent? Still, the government has
continually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/women-can-help-ease-talent-crunch-in-cyber-security-industry-josephine-teo" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">encouraged</a>&nbsp;

join the tech sector, both to ease the talent crunch in the industry and
to foster diversity.</p>
<p>As we celebrated International Women in Cyber Day last month, we spoke
to three GovTechies in cybersecurity roles on what it‚Äôs like as a woman
in the industry, how they got started, and their hopes for the future.</p>
<h3>Hi, thanks for taking the time to speak with us! Why don‚Äôt we start by hearing about what you do at GovTech?</h3>
<p><strong>Janice Chua, Deputy Director, Cybersecurity Strategy and Planning:</strong>&nbsp;The
Cyber Security Group‚Äôs (CSG) strategy and planning team is responsible
for the entire government‚Äôs cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>We work with internal stakeholders within GovTech and other agencies like
the Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore (CSA). This could mean monitoring
emerging cyber trends, identifying gaps in our existing strategies, and
architecting cybersecurity development plans for the government. Ultimately,
our work contributes to building a more secure digital government for Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Tham Mei Leng, Chief Information Security Officer, deployed to Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE):</strong>&nbsp;My
team is in charge of the ministry‚Äôs overall ICT security strategy and ensures
that it is aligned with the organisation‚Äôs business needs.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs part of the job to continually pick up new skills in the evolving
realm of IT and data security so that we stay relevant and prepared. In
particular, there are numerous cross-sharings at the Whole-of-Government
(WoG) level by both GovTech and CSA, where I get to learn about cyber incidents
and defensive measures beyond MSE.</p>
<p>Because my colleagues know the work I‚Äôm involved in, they often approach
me for generic cybersecurity advice, even for non-work-related cyber hygiene.</p>
<p><strong>Yvette Tay, Senior Cybersecurity Specialist, Security Operations Centre Engineering and Operations:</strong>&nbsp;My
team in CSG runs two Security Operations Centres (SOCs). The first SOC
provides a platform for vulnerability management across WoG central services.
Security vulnerabilities are quickly identified and acted upon.</p>
<p>The second provides cybersecurity monitoring. My team is responsible for
the service management of the SOC, establishing the operations processes,
streamlining operations tasks, and ensuring there is no disruption to service
availability.</p>
<h3>What‚Äôs your proudest moment in your cybersecurity career so far?</h3>
<p><strong>Yvette:</strong>&nbsp;In a previous role, I was the only female
business critical Cybersecurity Engineer in my Asia Pacific team, supporting
accounts for premium customers on a wide range of cybersecurity products.
The role was challenging and there were several occasions where I had to
go onsite at short notice for high-priority escalations to resolve urgent
product issues. Despite having to work across time zones, cultures and
teams on mostly novel technical problems, my support team and I managed
to get all the issues resolved for my premium customers.</p>
<p><strong>Janice:</strong>&nbsp;It‚Äôs gratifying to see the government‚Äôs
cyber defence plan coming together and having a sound strategy backed by
a motivated and committed team. It‚Äôs what enables us to spring into action
and respond when incidents like the SolarWinds attack occur.</p>
<h3>Mei Leng, you were named one of the&nbsp;<a href="https://womeninsecurityaseanregion.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">top 30 women</a>&nbsp;in cybersecurity at the ASEAN Region Awards this year. What was that like?</h3>
<p><strong>Mei Leng:</strong>&nbsp;I am humbled and grateful to be the recipient
of the award. I felt thankful that my work had been recognised. It motivates
me to continue to challenge myself to achieve greater heights.</p>
<h3>What inspired you to pursue a career in cybersecurity?</h3>
<p><strong>Janice:</strong>&nbsp;My bosses in CSG took a chance on me and
gave me the opportunity to pursue a career in cybersecurity even though
I came from an economics background. I embarked on this path as I thought
it was important to build knowledge and gain skills in cybersecurity as
we move towards an increasingly connected and digital world.</p>
<p><strong>Yvette:</strong>&nbsp;Cybersecurity is an interesting field, and
I get a sense of job satisfaction knowing that my work has a direct impact
on not just the company, but the country.</p>
<p><strong>Mei Leng:</strong>&nbsp;I started out in IT development and project
management. After years of rushing out systems and code deployments, it
suddenly struck me during a quiet moment, to question whether our common
practice of leveraging open-source codes and libraries would post robustness
and security issues for the systems we had developed. This ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment
piqued my interest to read up more on computer security, and I decided
to make a bold move to pivot into cybersecurity.</p>
<h3>How has GovTech supported your career in cybersecurity?</h3>
<p><strong>Mei Leng:</strong>&nbsp;My bosses and colleagues in CSG are warm
and collaborative, often sharing their knowledge.</p>
<p>CSG has also been generous in ensuring we have the time and resources
to continually improve our capabilities, keeping us abreast of wider developments
in digitalisation and cybersecurity. This enables us to make sound recommendations
in balancing the changing operational needs and evolving cybersecurity
situations.</p>
<p><strong>Janice:</strong>&nbsp;Indeed, I have had good bosses who gave
me opportunities to expand my knowledge in cyber by attending courses from
renowned cybersecurity organisations like the Sans Institute and EC Council.
Above all, I‚Äôve learnt a lot on the job from my fellow colleagues as they
have been most generous in sharing their knowledge and explaining complicated
cybersecurity concepts.</p>
<p>Lim Bee Kwan (the Assistant Chief Executive of Governance and Cybersecurity
at GovTech) has also served as a good role model of a female leader in
the cybersecurity space.</p>
<h3>Any words of advice for women who aspire to a cybersecurity career?</h3>
<p><strong>Yvette:</strong>&nbsp;It is never too late to start picking up
new skills, especially in your areas of interest. You will be rewarded
with a great sense of achievement as you slowly build and expand your technical
and business domain knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Janice:</strong>&nbsp;Build your networks. There are many good
platforms and communities to join like the Singapore Computer Society and
the Association of Information Security Professionals. Speak to people
in the field and learn more about what they do to see if the work truly
excites and interests you.</p>
<p><strong>Mei Leng:</strong>&nbsp;Cybersecurity is not a ‚Äúhigh wall‚Äù, but
a ‚Äúlong-run‚Äù. It requires passion, regardless of gender, to continue the
journey as technology changes quickly and cyber threats are always evolving.
It is not a job where muscular strength is an advantage. What it needs
is mental grit, agility, and resilience.</p>
<p>I am glad to see more women in different disciplines within cybersecurity.</p>
