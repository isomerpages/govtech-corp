<p>You might not have heard about it, but GovTech has this thing called the
(Digital Technology Attachment Programme, or DTAP for short, that allows
staff to get seconded to industry partners – while remaining as GovTech
staff, of course.</p>
<p>We spoke to our very own Stephanie Yeo, a senior delivery manager at GovTech
who through the DTAP programme, spent some time at&nbsp;<a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VMware Pivotal Labs</a>,
an American multinational software company as a Product Manager (PM).</p>

<h3>Stephanie, what made you want to try the DTAP programme out?</h3>
<p>After spending 5 years working at GovTech, I thought it would be quite
refreshing to have a change of environment – even if it’s just for a year.
In that sense, the DTAP programme is great because it lets us have new
perspectives and experiences without actually leaving GovTech – a place
that I still hold very dear to my heart.</p>
<h3>Surely, working in a completely new environment must have some challenges. What were these for you?</h3>
<p>Well, for one, the role that I held at GovTech and my role at Pivotal
were quite different, and I’ve had to learn to adjust quickly.</p>
<p>In GovTech, we deliver the product as a GovTech team. The client is our
product owner, and projects usually span over a few years.</p>
<p>At Pivotal Labs, not only do we deliver the product, we also need to equip
the client’s PM with the skills that they need to manage the product in
the future.</p>
<p>Typical projects may be as short as 8 weeks and usually not more than
a year.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also differences in culture.</p>
<p>Most of the people in Pivotal Labs are expats coming from all over the
world (Jersey, Canada, US, UK, etc.) My boss is from Jamaica and my buddy
is from Columbia. Because of the COVID-19 situation, I also got to work
with folks from Sydney as offices around the world look for ways to collaborate.</p>
<p>They also have an amazing Slack (a business communication software) network
where all the PMs in Labs around the world can join channels and discuss
topics, as if we were all in the same office. People also are very willing
to start video conferences to share their experiences.</p>
<p>One thing I’ve noticed is that my friends at Pivotal are all very outspoken,
even for roles that you’d typically associate with more introverted individuals
(such as engineers).</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed the energy and culture very much – people are punctual,
and are able to have open and honest discussions about our challenges at
work.</p>
<h3>The DTAP programme lasted for 1 year, did you miss GovTech?</h3>
<p>Yes, definitely. I miss my colleagues! Unfortunately, I only managed to
catch up with my colleagues a couple of times in 2020 before COVID-19.
Pivotal is based out of WeWork Funan, and the GovTech office I used to
work at is at the Sandcrawler building at One North, so they’re not that
far away.</p>
<p>That said, with the new WFH arrangements, I’ve adapted. – I’ve met my
GovTech colleagues virtually several times and managed to join some meetings
to share my experience so far.</p>
<h3>Any tips for your colleagues at GovTech who are thinking about joining DTAP?</h3>
<p>Just go for it! It’s a good opportunity to learn from the industry. The
experience is similar to embarking on a new job. Keep an open mind, make
use of your experiences in GovTech, and see how it works out when applied
to private organisations!</p>
