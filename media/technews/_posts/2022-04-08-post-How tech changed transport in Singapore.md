<p>Our streets might still be quieter than usual. Still, pre-COVID, millions
of commutes were made every single day in Singapore, whether it was by
motorists zipping down our expressways, passengers travelling on our MRT
lines, or bus riders steadily moving along bus routes.</p>

<p>Keeping Singapore moving is no doubt a herculean task involving the maintenance
of roads, train tracks, and other heavy-duty infrastructure. Beyond these
engineering feats, tech has played a major role in making transport here
more seamless and convenient. (Pssst, GovTech actually uses AI to&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/how-govtech-simulates-four-million-bus-rides-a-day" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">simulate bus rides</a>&nbsp;for better planning).</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take a look at some of these other innovations in public transport,
roads, taxis and even bicycles that have kept the country moving.</p>
<h3>Public transport fare system</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, it took two people to operate a public bus â€“ one to
drive and the other to collect fares and issue tickets. The bus conductor&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/old-bus-tickets-among-400-items-of-historical-significance-donated-to-national-archives-of" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">carried stacks of bus tickets</a>, issuing one to each passenger and punching
a hole in the ticket to indicate the bus stop where the passenger boarded.</p>
<p>In 1975,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/milestones" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SBS</a>&nbsp;started introducing
the one-man operation ticketing system into selected bus routes. With this
system, passengers drop the exact fare amount into a box while the driver
issues the ticket through a machine. Yes, just the ability to pay cash,
not directly to a human, was considered cutting-edge technology back then.
Still, bus conductors continued to be a part of many bus journeys until&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.ntwu.org.sg/NTWU/Pages/AboutUs.aspx" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1984</a>, when SBS fully implemented the system.</p>
<p>While the new system was a big improvement, there was still a significant
drawback â€“ riders had to have the exact fare on them as the ticketing machine
didnâ€™t issue change. Five-cent coins were particularly useful during this
era as certain fares were in multiples of five, 35 cents, for example.</p>
<p>Hence, the magnetic farecard system was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transitlink.com.sg/milestones/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">launched in 1990</a>,
heralding the start of the cashless fare system in Singapore. These farecards
were inserted into a farecard validator and passengers hit the appropriate
button to pay the amount they needed. The card is then returned with a
paper ticket. When the farecard was low in value, riders could top them
up with cash.</p>
<p>Best of all, these farecards could also be used for MRT rides, integrating
the ticketing systems. There were even commemorative farecards issued â€“
such as this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carousell.sg/p/star-wars-episode-1-smrt-giro-farecards-1005461646/?t-id=NSfiJfeh7c_1619608817319&amp;t-referrer_request_id=DjkbMmpKYdPP_NQj" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">set</a>&nbsp;of
Star Wars cards launched in conjunction with The Phantom Menace hitting
big screens.</p>
<p>Another added layer of convenience through contactless payment was added
in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ezlink.com.sg/about-ez-link/company-profile/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2002</a>,
when EZ-Link cards were rolled out. With these new cards, passengers simply
tapped the card at the card reader when they board and when they disembark.</p>
<p>Contactless payment was further enhanced in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/simplygo-by-tapping-your-credit-card-or-phone" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2019</a>&nbsp;when
card readers and fare gantries started accepting payments straight from
contactless credit cards. Passengers can now even pay using their mobile
phone through services like Apple Pay or Google Pay.</p>
<h3>Congestion pricing</h3>
<p>To curb congestion on the roads here, Singapore has operated some form
of congestion pricing since&nbsp;<a href="https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&amp;context=soe_research" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1975</a>&nbsp;by
charging drivers a fee for driving in certain areas during peak hours.</p>
<p>The first such system was the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/from-the-straits-times-archives-singapores-transport-policies-over-the-years" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Area Licensing Scheme</a>,
which designated the Central Business District as a restricted zone. Drivers
who wanted to enter during the restricted times had to buy and display
a special decal on their vehicles.</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, but the difficulty was in enforcement. Officers
were situated at every entry point to the CBD and manually inspected vehicles
for the decals. Because they were not supposed to slow or stop traffic
(this would have defeated the purpose of congestion pricing) to carry out
their inspection, their work required some serious eye power.</p>
<p>Enforcement officers continued to eyeball vehicles for more than two decades
until&nbsp;<a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_832__2009-01-05.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1998</a>&nbsp;when
Electronic Road Pricing was launched. All vehicles in Singapore were outfitted
with in-vehicle units with cash cards that motorists had to keep topped
up. At the same time, large overhead gantries spanning the entire road
were progressively set up at different points of heavy traffic flow. These
gantries could automatically scan the in-vehicle units and deduct the appropriate
toll from the cash cards. As such, all motorists had to do was ensure their
cash cards had enough money.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/erp-readers-be-replaced-free-satellite-based-units-2021-lta" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2020</a>,
it was announced that new ERP units will be installed in vehicles starting
from the second half of 2021. By 2023, these new units will work with the
new satellite-based ERP system, which will do away with the need for ERP
gantries.</p>
<h3>Taxi services</h3>
<p>Stick your arm out on the side of a street, flag a taxi, and your ride
stops next to you. This action used to be commonplace but is becoming increasingly
rare thanks to the digitalisation of getting a taxi.</p>
<p>And this digitalisation started way before smartphones and apps became
ubiquitous. For instance, taxis started accepting NETS payments in&nbsp;
<a href="https://mothership.sg/2020/03/old-taxis-in-singapore/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2006</a>, and passengers could book rides through the internet starting
in 2009.</p>
<p>But the true disruptive force came in the mid-2010s when apps for private
hire car rides, such as Grab and Uber, stormed the scene. Their market
influence quickly built up to the point that new regulations for private
hire driver vocational&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2017/3/2/applications-for-private-hire-car-drivers-vocational-licence-to-open-on-13-march-2017.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">licences</a>&nbsp;and
for private hire cars to display&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2017/4/2/all-private-hire-cars-to-display-decals-from-1-july-2017.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">decals</a>&nbsp;were
introduced in 2017.</p>
<p>This forced established taxi operators to up their game, improving their
booking appsâ€™ user experience and coming up with new fare structures such
as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/comfortdelgro-launches-new-flat-fare-option-for-app-bookings" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fixed pricing.</a>
</p>
<p>As for the private hire car apps, quite a few new players entered the
scene â€“ Ryde, Gojek, Urge, Jugnoo â€“ but only a few had staying power in
a competitive market.</p>
<h3>Cycling</h3>
<p>The humble two-wheeler driven by pedal power got a huge dose of tech in&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wheel-woes-the-rise-and-fall-of-singapore-s-bike-sharing-11336200" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2017</a>&nbsp;when three bike-sharing companies â€“ Mobike, oBike, and Ofo
â€“ set up shop in Singapore within months of each other.</p>
<p>The idea was to spread shareable bikes across the island so that anyone
who wants to rent a bicycle can scan the QR code on it, unlock the bike,
and ride away. When the rider reaches his destination, he scans the QR
code again to lock the bike and thatâ€™s it.</p>
<p>However, this convenience led to indiscriminate bike parking, causing
unsightly scenes of bikes scattered at void decks and even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/couple-caught-on-video-dumping-bikes-in-drain-obike-files-police-report" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">dumped into drains.</a>
</p>
<p>A year later, new regulations came up, requiring bike sharing operators
to apply for a licence and also implement geo-fencing so that their bikes
can be parked only in certain areas.</p>
<p>The government also established a sandbox licence in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/news/lta-accepting-applications-for-bike-sharing-sandbox-licences" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2020</a>&nbsp;so
that aspiring bike operators can run fleets of up to 1,000 bikes.</p>
<p>In recent years, several new players have thrown their hat into the ring
but most were short-lived. As of early 2022, just three brands are still
operating â€“ SG Bike, Mobike (which has been acquired by SG Bike), and Anywheel
â€“ with a total fleet size of about 40,000 bikes.</p>
<h3>Whatâ€™s next?</h3>
<p>As we seek greater convenience in our commutes, the world of transport
will continue to be shaped by tech and innovation. One promising area is&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/what-is-smart-nation/initiatives/Transport/autonomous-vehicles" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">autonomous vehicles</a>, which are already operating along&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/pay-to-ride-on-driverless-buses-in-two-areas-until-april-30" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fixed routes</a>&nbsp;in
a few places. The entire western part of Singapore has also been designated
as a testing ground for driverless vehicles.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s hard to predict when driverless vehicles and other transport tech
will reach their full potential. But one thingâ€™s for sure â€“ itâ€™s an exciting
road ahead!</p>
