<p>Valentine‚Äôs Day is just around the corner!</p>
<p>That means it‚Äôs the season for expensive chocolates, flowers, and fully-booked
restaurants. That‚Äôs all good, but as any married couple will tell you,
making a love story go the distance will definitely take a lot more than
that.</p>
<p>Think effort, commitment, and lots of hard work. Thankfully, these days,
there are plenty of apps going around to make life a little easier for
loved ones.</p>
<p>With that in mind, our GovTech team has selected our top apps for couples

<h3>1. Get intellectually stimulated with the NLB mobile app</h3>
<p>Ah, the library ‚Äì one of the first places that young Singaporeans go on
a date. It‚Äôs air-conditioned, has a large collection of books ‚Äì and it‚Äôs,
of course, free. Here‚Äôs the thing: libraries have plenty to offer a relationship
long after the honeymoon period. Nurture your relationship through shared
interests with the National Library Board app. Borrow books and other audiovisual
material that spark conversations, plan cultural dates, and attend events
together.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a unique way to bond and grow as a couple ‚Äì remember, staying intellectually
compatible is a big part of being romantically compatible! Download the
app&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileapp.nlb.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>
<p>PS: If you borrow ebooks, you don‚Äôt need to worry about returning them
late. That‚Äôs one way to avoid arguing about fines!</p>
<h3>2. Never lose your way again with NParks NEAR</h3>
<p>Singapore has a huge range of public parks, thanks to NParks. That means
plenty of green spaces for couples to unwind after a long week of work.
Take a long stroll amongst nature as a couple, or hop on a bicycle and
see the paths take you. Singapore‚Äôs Park Connector Network (PNC) has 300
km of trails, and there‚Äôs no better way to explore all of them than via
the NParks Explore A Route (NEAR) mobile app.</p>
<p>This augmented reality (AR)-enabled application (NParks) will enhance
your couple experiences by overlaying interactive, informative content
on the real-world environment. Learn and get entertained while being on
the move!</p>
<p>For those who‚Äôre afraid of getting lost (and partners losing their tempers),
a key feature of NEAR is an interactive map, which enables users to navigate
and explore the PCN and various trails. This includes detailed route information,
points of interest, and distance markers, encouraging discovery and exploration.</p>
<p>Get NEAR with your partner&nbsp;<a href="https://near.nparks.gov.sg/about" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here!</a>
</p>
<h3>3. Get your relationship moving with MyTransport</h3>
<p>When it comes to love, showing up is important. But showing up on time
is equally, if not more important; it‚Äôs not good to keep your partner waiting
in the sweltering Singapore heat.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs where the MyTransport app comes in.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/ltagov/Home/PDF/MTM.pdf" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyTransport</a>&nbsp;lets
you check for real-time updates on public transport services: Check bus
arrival timings, train schedules, and service disruptions to ensure smooth
and efficient journeys.</p>
<p>Use it to minimise waiting times at the bus stop, and save some money
instead of taking a taxi or a ride-hail.</p>
<h3>4. Keep fit together with ActiveSG</h3>
<p>Feel like the relationship is getting a little stagnant? Maybe it‚Äôs time
to liven things up with an active lifestyle. Why? Engaging in physical
activities together and having shared goals are great ways for couples
to stay together. Here‚Äôs the thing: Fitness is a continuous project; and
the work never ends.</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs why you need to download ActiveSG. Stay in shape together with
the many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activesgcircle.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ActiveSG</a>&nbsp;facilities
across the island ‚Äì at a fraction of what private gyms or operators charge!
Stuff you can do together includes classic favourites like badminton, swimming,
or hitting the gym. But there are also programmes that you can sign up
for that feature more niche sports. Think archery or belly dancing, or
even pickleball.</p>
<p>Yes, pickleball (you read that correctly).</p>
<p>(PS: You can also hold each other accountable to good fitness habits by
downloading the LumiHealth app)</p>
<h3>5. Prepare to settle down together with MyNiceHome</h3>
<p>In Singapore, asking someone to buy a HDB together is the equivalent of
a marriage proposal. That‚Äôs why you know things are getting serious when
your partner tells you to check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mynicehome.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyNiceHome.</a>
</p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre choosing to BTO or buy a resale flat, you can find information
about grants, loans, or even renovation and decoration tips. This makes
it a treasure trove for those getting their flat for the first time. (But
also the second, or even third time)</p>
<p>Remember, buying a flat will probably be one of the largest financial
commitments Singaporeans make in their lifetime, so it‚Äôs important for
couples to get educated on this!</p>
<h3>6. Seal the deal with Our Marriage Journey</h3>
<p>For couples planning to take their commitment to the next level, the
<a href="https://www.marriage.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Our Marriage Journey</a>&nbsp;portal is a game-changer. The new Registry
of Marriages (ROM) portal simplifies the process of filing for marriage
online via SingPass, making the journey to your big day a little less fuss-free.</p>
<p>On the portal, you can also get access to resources to help prepare for
marriage. You can also verify marriage documents or plan your solemnisation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Our Marriage Journey extends its services beyond just the
administrative necessities. The portal is a comprehensive guide for all
things related to marriage in Singapore, offering an array of tools and
information to support couples in every step of their marriage journey.
From the initial stages of understanding legal requirements to the joyous
moments of planning your solemnisation ceremony, everything can be managed
with ease and convenience.</p>
<p>Getting married has never been easier! (Well, kinda, you still need to
find a willing partner)</p>
<h3>7. Go through life together with LifeSG</h3>
<p>Got married? Trust us ‚Äì you‚Äôre only halfway through your romantic journey
together. Things often get hectic during marriage, with plenty of chores
and errands. This is especially true if you have children.</p>
<p>Well, enter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.life.gov.sg/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=ACCSSAlwaysOn&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAoKeuBhCoARIsAB4WxtcDQWzqOlUZkCWvmQ9MUs_CVq1JCOiUGtMGB0HCW-ELc8OR_Bc_qE8aAvVpEALw_wcB" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LifeSG:</a>&nbsp;your
digital assistant for navigating life‚Äôs milestones as a couple. This can
be anything from getting your baby bonus, paying taxes, booking public
facilities, as well as online video consults from HDB (including getting
a CPF top-up grant).</p>
<p>There are also educational resources if you want to read up about some
of married life‚Äôs biggest (and most stressful) parts. These include getting
financial support for pregnancy, employing a domestic helper, or registering
your child for primary one.</p>

these apps provide not just convenience but also enriching experiences
for you and your loved one.</p>
