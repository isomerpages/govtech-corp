<p>It’s 2025, and GenAI is officially mainstream and one of the most transformative
technologies today.
<br>
<br>In just two years, it has evolved from a novelty into an indispensable
tool across industries. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1501740550515206" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">From generating text, images, and videos to writing code and even composing music</a>,
GenAI is reshaping how we work and create. You might even struggle to think
of the last time you drafted your resume or summarised a report without
it.
<br>
<br>That being said, most users barely scratch the surface of its true capabilities.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they’re not asking AI the right questions. In other words, <strong>their skills in Prompt Engineering</strong> leave
much to be desired.</p>
<h3>What is a Prompt, and Why Does it Matter?</h3>
<p>A <strong>prompt</strong> is the input (most commonly in text) you provide
to an AI model. The way you structure this input <strong>directly influences</strong> the
quality of the response you get.</p>
<p>For example, if your prompt is something as vague and brief as <strong>&lt;Tell me about climate change&gt;, </strong>it’s
unlikely you’ll get output that you might be able to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you can feed GenAI with more detail, you’re more likely to
get something more useful.</p>
<p>This is where <strong>prompt engineering</strong> comes in—the practice
of designing effective prompts to ensure AI generates <strong>accurate, relevant, and high-quality</strong> responses.</p>
<h3>Introducing the CO-STAR Framework</h3>
<p>At <strong>GovTech</strong>, our officers follow the <strong><a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/collections/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/playbooks/prompt-engineering-playbook-beta-v3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CO-STAR Framework</a></strong>,
featured in our <strong>Prompt Engineering Playbook</strong>, to craft better
prompts.</p>
<h4>CO-STAR stands for…</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Context</strong> – Provide background information to help the AI
understand the specific scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Objective</strong> – Clearly define the task to direct the AI’s
focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Style</strong> – Specify the desired writing style to align the
AI’s response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tone</strong> – Set the tone to ensure the response resonates with
the required sentiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Audience</strong> – Identify the intended audience so the AI can
tailor the response
<br>accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response</strong> – Define the format of the response to get structured,
useful outputs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
