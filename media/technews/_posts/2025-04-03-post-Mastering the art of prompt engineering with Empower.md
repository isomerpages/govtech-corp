<p>It’s 2025, and GenAI is officially mainstream and one of the most transformative
technologies today.
<br>
<br>In just two years, it has evolved from a novelty into an indispensable
tool across industries. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1501740550515206" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">From generating text, images, and videos to writing code and even composing music</a>,
GenAI is reshaping how we work and create. You might even struggle to think
of the last time you drafted your resume or summarised a report without
it.
<br>
<br>That being said, most users barely scratch the surface of its true capabilities.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they’re not asking AI the right questions. In other words, <strong>their skills in Prompt Engineering</strong> leave
much to be desired.</p>
