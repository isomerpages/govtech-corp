<p>In recent times, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by cyber criminals
to create convincing phishing sites, deepfakes, and fraudulent content
has made it even more challenging for defenders to protect individuals
and organisations.</p>
<p>However, AI is not only a tool for attackers — it is also a powerful weapon
for defenders. In this article, we will explore how AI is used to combat
the evolving threat of scams, focusing on GovTech’s Anti-Scam Products
(GASP) team and their innovative efforts in Singapore. From the Scam Analytics
and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS) to overcoming data poisoning challenges,
this article delves into the strategies and tools shaping the future of
scam prevention and cybersecurity:</p>

<h3>The Evolution of Scams with AI</h3>
<p>Scammers are leveraging emerging technologies like AI to enhance their
malicious tactics. Hence, the need for robust cybersecurity measures has
never been more urgent.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/scam-victims-singapore-lost-s6518-million-2023-record-high-cases" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Business Times article</a> published
earlier this year, scam victims in Singapore lost around S$650 million
to scams in 2023. Reported scam cases also hit a record high of 46,563
last year. From a more global perspective, a <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1280009/cost-cybercrime-worldwide" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report from Statistica</a> indicates
that from 2024 to 2029, the estimated cost of cybercrime worldwide is projected
to increase by $6.4 trillion U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>With alarming numbers like these, it’s no surprise that cybersecurity
and scam prevention are <a href="https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/singapore-encourages-the-use-of-ai-to-improve-cybersecurity-posture" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">growing concerns for the Singapore government</a> and
Singaporeans of all ages.</p>
<p>Increasing ease of access to new technology has also contributed to the
growing frequency of scams and online harms. AI is one such form of technology
that is growing in influence due to its rapidly expanding <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-ways-you-are-already-using-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">versatility in applications</a>.
Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, shares similar views about the increasing
significance of AI in a <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/google-25th-birthday-sundar-pichai/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">blogpost</a> kick-starting
Google’s 25th birthday celebrations last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. It’s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to mobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. It’s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an incredible accelerant of human ingenuity.” </em>-
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement from Google’s Chief Executive only reinforces what we already
know: that AI is here to stay and will continue to change the way we live
our lives. Despite the endless possibilities of AI for good, we have already
seen how it is <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ai-phishing-attempts-cyber-attacks-technology-scams-deepfakes-ransomware-4506631" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">used for the wrong purposes</a> —
the enhancement of scam messages and calls, malware, phishing emails, deepfake
videos, etc.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are signs that not all hope is lost, and AI can indeed
be used for public good, like ensuring a safer digital cyberspace for online
users.</p>
<h3>AI Cybersecurity System Deployed at the Paris Olympic Games 2024</h3>
<p>A positive case study example is demonstrated at the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ai-system-to-protect-athletes-from-online-abuse-during-paris-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Paris Olympic Games 2024</a>.
For the first time, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) used a new
AI-powered monitoring service to protect athletes and officials from online
abuse at both the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games 2024.</p>
<p>The AI-powered tool monitored thousands of social media accounts in real-time
across 35+ languages. Developed by the IOC Athletes’ Commission and the
Medical and Scientific Commission, this system flags abusive messages for
quick action by cybersecurity personnel, often before athletes see them.</p>
<p>Covering close to 15,000 athletes and 2,000 officials, the AI-driven system
is part of a broader safeguarding initiative to protect athletes' physical
and mental well-being. This allows them to focus fully on competing at
the games and reduce the likelihood of being affected by abusive comments
on social media platforms.</p>
<h3>Fighting Scams in Singapore with GovTech’s Anti-Scam Products (GASP) Team</h3>
<p>Closer to home, the GASP team was formed with the mission of building
tech products to detect, deter and disrupt scammers at scale. We sat down
with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markchen-sg/?originalSubdomain=sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Mark Chen</a>,
Principal Product Manager at GASP, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-nhy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Andre Ng</a>, Assistant
Director at GASP, to find out more about how the GASP team uses AI to protect
Singaporeans from online scams.</p>
<h3>Protecting Singapore Residents from the Shadows with SATIS</h3>
<p>With the increasing number of malicious websites designed to steal users’
login credentials and banking details, the GASP team developed the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS)</a> in
collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This tool actively
consolidates threat intelligence, analyses, and disrupts any malicious
websites. These include job scam sites or bank phishing sites that mimic
the look and feel of the real websites of legitimate organisations.</p>
<p>SATIS is powered by the <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/cybersecurity/rmse/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recursive Machine-Learning Site Evaluator (rMSE)</a> —
an in-house Machine Learning (ML) technology developed by GovTech. It works
in the background and around the clock, analysing over hundreds of thousands
of URLs daily to identify potentially malicious sites. As of Sept 2024
SATIS has successfully identified and disrupted over 50,000 scam-related
websites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“With SATIS and rMSE, the police can now proactively hunt and take down malicious websites at scale before anyone falls prey. This would not be humanly possible without AI technology.”</em> -
