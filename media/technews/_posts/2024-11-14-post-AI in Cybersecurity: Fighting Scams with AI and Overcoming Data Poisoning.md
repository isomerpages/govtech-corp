<p>In recent times, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by cyber criminals
to create convincing phishing sites, deepfakes, and fraudulent content
has made it even more challenging for defenders to protect individuals
and organisations.</p>
<p>However, AI is not only a tool for attackers—it is also a powerful weapon
for defenders. In this article, we will explore how AI is used to combat
the evolving threat of scams, focusing on GovTech’s Anti-Scam Products
(GASP) team and their innovative efforts in Singapore. From the Scam Analytics
and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS) to overcoming data poisoning challenges,
this article delves into the strategies and tools shaping the future of
scam prevention and cybersecurity:</p>

<h3>The Evolution of Scams with AI</h3>
<p>Scammers are leveraging emerging technologies like AI to enhance their
malicious tactics. Hence, the need for robust cybersecurity measures has
never been more urgent.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/scam-victims-singapore-lost-s6518-million-2023-record-high-cases" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Business Times article</a> published
earlier this year, scam victims in Singapore lost around S$650 million
to scams in 2023. Reported scam cases also hit a record high of 46,563
last year. From a more global perspective, a <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1280009/cost-cybercrime-worldwide" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report from Statistica</a> indicates
that from 2024 to 2029, the estimated cost of cybercrime worldwide is projected
to increase by $6.4 trillion U.S. dollars.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Statistics taken from <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1280009/cost-cybercrime-worldwide" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Statistica</a>, published 30<sup>th</sup> July 2024.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>With alarming numbers like these, it’s no surprise that cybersecurity
and scam prevention are <a href="https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/singapore-encourages-the-use-of-ai-to-improve-cybersecurity-posture" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">growing concerns for the Singapore government</a> and
Singaporeans of all ages.</p>
<p>Increasing ease of access to new technology has also contributed to the
growing frequency of scams and online harms. AI is one such form of technology
that is growing in influence due to its rapidly expanding <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/five-ways-you-are-already-using-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">versatility in applications</a>.
Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, shares similar views about the increasing
significance of AI in a <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/google-25th-birthday-sundar-pichai/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">blogpost</a> kick-starting
Google’s 25th birthday celebrations last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. It’s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to mobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. It’s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an incredible accelerant of human ingenuity.” </em>-
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement from Google’s Chief Executive only reinforces what we already
know: that AI is here to stay and will continue to change the way we live
our lives. Despite the endless possibilities of AI for good, we have already
seen how it is <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ai-phishing-attempts-cyber-attacks-technology-scams-deepfakes-ransomware-4506631" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">used for the wrong purposes</a>—the
enhancement of scam messages and calls, malware, phishing emails, deepfake
videos, etc.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are signs that not all hope is lost, and AI can indeed
be used for public good, like ensuring a safer digital cyberspace for online
users.</p>
<h3>AI Cybersecurity System Deployed at the Paris Olympic Games 2024</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Olympics" src="/images/technews/olympics_logo.jpg">
</div>
<p>A positive case study example is demonstrated at the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ai-system-to-protect-athletes-from-online-abuse-during-paris-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Paris Olympic Games 2024</a>.
For the first time, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) used a new
AI-powered monitoring service to protect athletes and officials from online
abuse at both the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games 2024.</p>
<p>The AI-powered tool monitored thousands of social media accounts in real-time
across 35+ languages. Developed by the IOC Athletes’ Commission and the
Medical and Scientific Commission, this system flags abusive messages for
quick action by cybersecurity personnel, often before athletes see them.</p>
<p>Covering close to 15,000 athletes and 2,000 officials, the AI-driven system
is part of a broader safeguarding initiative to protect athletes' physical
and mental well-being. This allows them to focus fully on competing at
the games and reduces the likelihood of being affected by abusive comments
on social media platforms.</p>
<h3>Fighting Scams in Singapore with GovTech’s Anti-Scam Products (GASP) Team</h3>
<p>Closer to home, the GASP team was formed with the mission of building
tech products to detect, deter, and disrupt scammers at scale. We sat down
with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markchen-sg/?originalSubdomain=sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Mark Chen</a>,
Principal Product Manager at GASP, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-nhy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mr Andre Ng</a>, Assistant
Director at GASP, to find out more about how the GASP team uses AI to protect
Singaporeans from online scams.</p>

</p>
<h3>Protecting Singapore Residents from the Shadows with SATIS</h3>
<p>With the increasing number of malicious websites designed to steal users’
login credentials and banking details, the GASP team developed the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS)</a> in
collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This tool actively
consolidates threat intelligence, analyses, and disrupts any malicious
websites. These include job scam sites or bank phishing sites that mimic
the look and feel of the real websites of legitimate organisations.</p>
<p>SATIS is powered by the <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/cybersecurity/rmse/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recursive Machine-Learning Site Evaluator (rMSE)</a>—an
in-house Machine Learning (ML) technology developed by GovTech. It works
in the background and around the clock, analysing over hundreds of thousands
of URLs daily to identify potentially malicious sites. As of September
2024, SATIS has successfully identified and disrupted over 50,000 scam-related
websites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“With SATIS and rMSE, the police can now proactively hunt and take down malicious websites at scale before anyone falls prey. This would not be humanly possible without AI technology.”</em> -
Andre Ng</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>If you happen to land on a SATIS-disrupted scam website, you’ll see one
of the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A red warning screen notification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warning from SPF</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error notification (e.g. error 404 message)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p><em>A red warning screen notification issued due to SATIS’ disruption and identification of a potentially malicious website.</em>
</p>
<h3>How Does GASP Use AI to Fight Scams in Singapore?</h3>
<p>In the early days (i.e. 1-2 years ago), finding scam sites often involved
manual operators looking for anomalies vs. static rules—known threats and
behaviours that attackers commonly use when setting up scam sites. However,
this process has since evolved with the use of ML to identify unknown patterns
and anomalous behaviours at a rate that is not humanly possible.</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p>This is where the power of AI comes in. With AI, vast amounts of data
can be analysed in a short time frame. AI can then quickly draw logical
conclusions on what is considered anomalous behaviour from the pool of
data studied and subsequently perform routine security functions implemented
by the GASP team. Thus, the ML technology behind rMSE for instance, is
continuously improving on its own with more data being fed into it. Over
time, AI will learn and adapt to new trends of attacking behaviours and
afterwards suggest safe code fixes to counter the attackers.</p>
<p>This is possible because AI can meticulously scan millions of lines of
code rapidly, scrutinising each part to determine if any line can be used
to breach systems. However, scammers can still introduce vulnerabilities
into AI defence systems by poisoning the data sets used to train AI cybersecurity
products.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as <strong>data poisoning</strong>.</p>
<div class="isomer-card-grid">
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">What is Data Poisoning?</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Data poisoning is a type of cyberattack that aims to undermine artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models by corrupting training
datasets. This weakens the models' accuracy and reliability by adding fake
datam altering existing datasets or even removing essential data types.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Overcoming Data Poisoning by striking the Balance between High-Quality Data and Quantity of Data</h3>
<p>When asked if the GASP team faces issues of data poisoning, Andre states
that the problem definitely exists. However, the GASP team carefully validates
the dataset used to train ML models in their products to reduce the risk
of data poisoning.</p>
<p>Taking rMSE as an example, part of the data collected comes from police
cases on scam-related issues. Since police reports require police officers
to officially close a case, the data collected from SPF is considered to
be high-quality because it has been carefully verified by humans.</p>
<p>Additionally, the GASP team utilises the <strong><a href="https://www.scamshield.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield</a></strong> database
of scam reports from Singaporeans to further enhance the quality of the
training dataset.</p>
<div class="isomer-card-grid">
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">What is ScamShield?</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">ScamShield is a mobile app that blocks scam calls and messages by matching
unknown numbers against a database managed by the SPF. Numbers linked to
scams are blocked automatically. ScamShield also uses an on-device algorithm
to analyse incoming messages and detect possible scams.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, despite the carefully validated datasets, Mark states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In the scams or adversarial space, the more data you have, the better. However, the quality of data is also an important factor. So, you always have to strike a balance between large training datasets and carefully validated datasets.”</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another method the GASP team uses to validate datasets is to wait for
weeks or months before deciding if a website is safe or malicious.</p>
<p>Why is this necessary you might wonder? Mark explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“One good way to overcome data poisoning is to be patient. Scammers tend to resort to something called </em><strong><em>strategic squatting</em></strong><em> where they will register a domain online, put some benign or safe content on it and only turn the site malicious after a period of time. So sometimes there is a need to be patient in our analysis and judgement.” </em>-
Mark Chen</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="isomer-card-grid">
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">What is Strategic Squatting?</div>
<div class="isomer-card-description">Strategic squatting is a method attackers use to bypass security measures
and gain unauthorised system access. This technique involves registering
domain names that closely resemble legitimate ones, aiming to mislead users
and evade security filters.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence: A Double-Edged Sword</h3>
<p>As technology advances, so do scammers’ tactics, making it clear that
traditional cybersecurity methods alone are no longer sufficient. The rise
of AI has introduced both new challenges and solutions to the fight against
scams. GovTech’s GASP team has shown how AI can be harnessed to disrupt
and prevent malicious activities, significantly improving scam detection
and response in Singapore. However, the battle doesn’t stop there. Defenders
must evolve AI-driven solutions to outsmart and outpace attackers as malicious
actors adapt.</p>
<p>While the road ahead is complex, integrating AI into cybersecurity provides
a beacon of hope in the ongoing fight to protect users from online scams
and data poisoning.</p>
