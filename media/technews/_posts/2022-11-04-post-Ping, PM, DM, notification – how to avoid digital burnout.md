<p>As Singapore lifts pandemic restrictions and many aspects of life return
to normal, one thing is here to stay, at least for now – remote working,
or at least, a hybrid of working in the office and working from home.</p>
<p>While working from home certainly has its perks, it does mean more virtual
meetings, online written communication through email and messaging tools,
and more screen time overall.</p>
<p>Indeed, this increase in digital workload might well be a significant
reason why four out of five Singaporeans are feeling&nbsp;<a href="https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/singaporeans-are-most-de-energised-employees-in-asia" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">at risk of burnout</a>&nbsp;in
2022.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling fatigued and listlessness from an overdose of technology,
here are some&nbsp;<strong>tips to avoid digital burnout:</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Do a digital cleanse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove false urgencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid multitasking</p>
</li>

</ol>
<h3>1. Do a digital cleanse</h3>
<p>Few things are less draining than a cluttered email inbox with thousands,
even tens of thousands of unread mail. Or opening your social media account
and seeing a long list of notifications about the latest posts from your
contacts.</p>
<p>Tame that clutter by unsubscribing from email lists that you never open
and social media and accounts that you’ve lost interest in. It’s tempting
to cling onto an email subscription thinking there might come a day when
the information in one of the emails will come in handy. But that’s like
keeping that denim jacket from a lifetime ago on the off chance you’ll
find the occasion to wear it again.</p>
<p>If you’re paralysed by the thought of taking the first step, there is
help in the form of an app called&nbsp;<a href="https://unroll.me/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Unroll Me</a>. The tool
enables you to view all the newsletters that your email is subscribed to
and unsubscribe with just one tap. It also provides a service to “roll
up” all the remaining subscriptions into a daily digest.</p>
<h3>2. Remove false urgencies</h3>
<p>Speaking of bolded emails and red bubble notifications, we all know the
anxiety that can be caused by these indicators practically screaming, “READ
ME!”</p>
<p>Be kind to your eyes and mind. Turn off notifications for apps that you
don’t need an immediate update from. For instance, unless you’re in the
market for a job and are eagerly awaiting the reply of a recruiter, you
probably don’t need to turn on notifications for the LinkedIn app. The
same goes for your other social media apps unless you are using one of
them as a means of real-time communication.</p>
<p>Even tech giants are increasingly aware of the need that notifications
can become a distraction and need to be used in a controlled manner. Apple
and Google’s newer devices have&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT212608" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“focus mode”</a>&nbsp;that
enables you to customise the notifications you see when you activate the
function.</p>
<h3>3. Avoid multitasking</h3>

</p>
<p>One of the great paradoxes of technology is how it’s allowed us to be
productive on multiple tasks at the same time, but also doomed us to be
unproductive on multiple distractions at the same time.</p>
<p>Having multiple applications, windows, and tabs open may seem like a great
way to juggle various activities, but more often than not, it simply overwhelms
you. Just imagine you’re about to start writing an article about digital
burnout but a somewhat important looking email comes in from a co-worker
so you better look at that first. Oh, turns out it can wait. Right, I was
just going to reply to a WhatsApp, and since the app’s already open, it
won’t take me a sec. OK, now just a quick check of my Instagram and I swear
I’ll get back to my work, which is… what again?</p>
<p>One way to beat this time sink is to have a strategy and keep at it. For
example, you could break up work periods into 30 minute blocks. The first
25 minutes are fully focused on the task at hand, after which you reward
yourself with five minutes of doing whatever you want – check your phone,
sneak in some YouTube, whatever.</p>
<h3>4. Set digital boundaries</h3>
<p>If the hours you spend mindlessly watching TikTok videos are beginning
to concern you, you can set daily app usage limits.</p>
<p>The feature is available for both Android and iOS phones. Once your daily
allotted time is up, the app closes automatically. You can cut the allotted
time each week as a gradual way to wean yourself off the app. Of course,
if you’re willing to go cold turkey, simply delete the app altogether!</p>
<p>The Chrome internet browser features a similar setting where you can limit
the usage of individual websites.</p>
<h3>5. Routinely unplug</h3>

</p>
<p>Taking breaks from technology, whether for work or entertainment, helps
you to decompress. Set technology-free times when you can focus on other
things such as eating with your family, exercising, or just reading a good
book.</p>
<p>You can also set up technology-free zones at home. For example, no phones
at the dining table. Meal times are about enjoying the food and catching
up with people around the table. Putting your phone away from the bed at
bedtime helps kick the nasty habit of scrolling instead of sleeping.</p>
<h3>6. Manage, not abandon technology</h3>
<p>Tech is now a big part of both our professional and personal lives. It’s
unrealistic for most people to cut tech completely out.</p>
<p>Hence, the answer isn’t to turn our back on tech but to use it in a conscious
way that improves our lives rather than drains it.</p>
<p>So take control of your tech usage before it controls you instead. Your
physical and mental wellbeing will thank you for it.</p>
