<h3>In return for using Google’s apps and services, each of us surrenders some amount of information about ourselves. Here are some settings to toggle if you want to limit the amount of data Google collects about you.</h3>
<p>Imagine being approached by a stranger who knows exactly where you live
and work, as well as what you like and dislike. In this digital age, that
stranger most likely goes by the name of Google.</p>
<p>In exchange for the services Google provides, we volunteer seemingly innocuous
information about our lives and habits. The kind of keywords we use on
search engines, the locations we visit, and even the videos we choose to
watch—all these add up and allow Google to build a profile on each of us.</p>
<p>Thinking of taking back control of how much information Google can collect
about you? The TechNews team has got you covered.</p>

<h3>Manage data and personalisation</h3>
<p>Most of us use Google’s Chrome browser and apps on default settings, which
means that Google is granted permission to gather data on your location,
what you search for and watch on YouTube, as well as your voice and audio
activity. Here are three simple steps to revoke some of these permissions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open your Google account page at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://myaccount.google.com/</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Data &amp; Personalisation &gt; Activity Controls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disable data collection for selected activities</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to thoroughly curtail Google’s tracking of your location,
remember to turn off Web and App Activity in addition to Location History
because some Google apps still store timestamped location data in the background.</p>
<h3>Avoid ad targeting</h3>
<p>As explained in its privacy policy, Google and its partners use information
about your browsing habits to show you targeted ads. You can keep Google
from doing this by switching off Ad personalisation, also within the Data
&amp; Personalisation page. Bear in mind that in doing so, you may still
receive ads, but those ads may be entirely random and have no relevance
to you.</p>
<p>Fun fact: if you click on Go to ad settings, you can view what Google
has already deduced about you, including your age range and personal interests.
See how eerily accurate Google can get! You may even learn something about
yourself.</p>

<h3>Go cookie-free</h3>
<p>How do websites remember your login information and the contents of your
shopping cart? These useful functions are performed by cookies—not the
ones baked in an oven, but small packets of data sent from a website and
stored on your web browser.</p>
<p>If you’re purchasing items from an e-commerce platform, for example, the
website could use cookies to track not only what you’ve bought, but also
the pages that you’ve browsed on the site, as well as the ads you’ve clicked
on. Should you find this intrusive, try browsing in incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N
on Google Chrome) before making a purchase from the website.</p>
<p>To view and manage all cookies on your browser, select Settings &gt; Advanced
&gt; Content Settings &gt; Cookies &gt; All cookies and site data and remove
those that you may no longer need.</p>

<h3>Clean out your history and cache, or wipe your Google account</h3>
<p>We’ve described some of the ways that you can tweak your privacy settings
to limit Google’s tracking of your future online activities. But what to
do about the data that Google has already collected?</p>
<p>For starters, try clearing out your browsing history and cache (History
&gt; Clear browsing data), although keep in mind that this will temporarily
slow down the speed at which pages load, and you may have to input your
passwords again when accessing certain websites. If you’re determined to
purge Google of your data and quit Google altogether, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open your Google account page at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://myaccount.google.com/</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Data &amp; Personalisation &gt; Scroll down to Download your data
&gt; Delete a service or your account</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have it, four ways to keep Google from keeping tabs on you.
Privacy and convenience are trade-offs, but by running through your privacy
settings with a fine-comb, you can still enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>
