<h2>How to stop the internet from collecting your data</h2>
<p>As we all know, Google has been collecting data and information every
single time <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/theres-a-way-to-delete-the-frightening-amount-of-data-google-has-on-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>we perform a search, watch a video or even use Google Maps</u></a>.
But that's about to change: Google has announced it's <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sandbox-tracking-protection/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>killing off third-party cookies</u></a>,
starting from 2024. What this means is that the amount of user information
websites can track and share is now restricted. It is also more difficult
for advertisers to send you targeted ads based on your web activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this will only unfold in phases. There is much that we can do
in the meantime to limit our data from being collected by the likes of
Google and big corporations. Here are some tips.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Manage data and personalisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go cookie-free on your own terms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear your cache and browsing history</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Manage data and personalisation</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Managing your data and personalisation is one way to stop cookies from tracking you" src="/images/technews/how-to-stop-google-from-stalking-you-part2.png">
</div>
<p>Most of us use Googleâ€™s Chrome browser and apps on default settings, which
means that Google is granted permissions to gather data on your location,
what you search for and watch on YouTube, as well as your voice and audio
activity. Here are three simple steps to revoke some of these permissions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Open your Google account page at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://myaccount.google.com/</u></a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <em>Data &amp; Privacy</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down to disable data collection for the identified activities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to thoroughly curtail Googleâ€™s tracking of your location,
remember to turn off <em>Web and App Activity</em> in addition to <em>Location History</em> because
some Google apps still store timestamped location data in the background.</p>
<h4>How to avoid Google Ad targeting</h4>
<p>As explained in its privacy policy, Google and its partners use information
about your browsing habits to show you targeted ads. You can keep Google
from doing this by switching off <em>Ad personalisation</em>, also within
the <em>Data &amp; Personalisation</em> page. Bear in mind that in doing
so, you may still receive ads, but those ads may be entirely random and
have no relevance to you.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> If you click on <em>Go to ad</em> settings, you
can view what Google has already deduced about you, including your age
range and personal interests. See how eerily accurate Google can get! You
may even learn something about yourself.</p>
<h3>2. Go cookie-free on your own terms</h3>
<p></p>

<p>How do websites remember your login information and the contents of your
shopping cart? These useful functions are performed by cookiesâ€”not the
ones baked in an oven, but small packets of data sent from a website and
stored on your web browser.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re purchasing items from an e-commerce platform, for example, the
website could use cookies to track not only what youâ€™ve bought, but also
the pages that youâ€™ve browsed on the site, as well as the ads youâ€™ve clicked
on. Should you find this intrusive, try browsing in <em>incognito</em> mode
(Ctrl+Shift+N on Google Chrome) before making a purchase from the website.</p>
<p>To view and manage all cookies on your browser, select <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Advanced</em> &gt; <em>Content Settings</em> &gt; <em>Cookies</em> &gt; <em>All cookies and site data</em> and
remove those that you may no longer need.</p>

<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Protect your data privacy by going cookie-free" src="/images/technews/Cookie_free_TechNews.png">
</div>
<p>As a good practice, do not automatically click on "Accept all" when the
cookie privacy notice pops up. Yes, it is more tedious to do so, but editing
your settings on the website or rejecting the request will allow you to
block third-party cookies.</p>
<h3>3. Clear your cache and browsing history</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Clear your cache and browsing history to protect your data privacy" src="/images/technews/How_to_stop_Google_from_stalking_you.jpg">
</div>
<p>Weâ€™ve described some of the ways that you can tweak your privacy settings
to limit Googleâ€™s tracking of your future online activities. But what to
do about the data that Google has already collected?</p>
<p>For starters, try clearing out your browsing history and cache (History
&gt; Clear browsing data), although keep in mind that this will temporarily
slow down the speed at which pages load, and you may have to input your
passwords again when accessing certain websites. If youâ€™re determined to
purge Google of your data and quit Google altogether, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open your Google account page at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://myaccount.google.com/</u></a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <em>Data &amp; Personalisation</em> &gt; Scroll down to <em>Download your data</em> &gt; <em>Delete a service or your account</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have it, 3 ways to keep Google from keeping tabs on you.
Privacy and convenience are trade-offs, but by running through your privacy
settings with a fine-comb, you can still enjoy the best of both worlds</p>
