<p>You're facing a tight deadline for a crucial report. You've heard whispers
about ChatGPT's ability to generate instant reports, even passing professional
exams. Naturally, you're curious: "Can I leverage ChatGPT to meet this
deadline?" You're certainly not alone.</p>
<p>With ChatGPT processing over a billion queries daily, professionals and
students worldwide are exploring its potential to streamline their workflows.
These AI models, known as 'Generative AI', have garnered significant attention
for their capacity to produce diverse content, from articles and images
to code and artwork.</p>
<h3>What is Generative AI?</h3>
<p>"AI" stands for Artificial Intelligence, referring to computer systems
designed to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. This
involves creating algorithms and models that enable machines to understand,
reason, learn, and make decisions.</p>
<p>Generative AI, however, marks a pivotal shift. It's a subset of AI that
doesn't just analyse existing data, but actively creates new content—images,
text, audio—by identifying patterns and generating novel outputs. This
distinction represents a significant expansion in AI capabilities, opening
doors to previously unimaginable applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to develop sophisticated models that can understand and replicate
complex data structures is truly remarkable. With its ability to create
stunningly realistic images, remarkably coherent text, and even intricate
musical compositions, not to mention the rapid pace of these advancements,
it’s easy to understand the growing interest and applications of generative
AI across various industries.</p>
<h4>How Generative AI works</h4>
<p>Imagine an art student diligently studying thousands of paintings to grasp
the techniques of a master. This student is akin to generative AI, learning
through a process similar to deep learning, where massive datasets are
used to train interconnected layers of algorithms (complex neural networks)
to recognise patterns in data. Just as the student uses the learned techniques
to create their own original artwork, generative AI leverages these learned
patterns to produce novel outputs. The student might refine their brushstrokes
and experiment with colour combinations to achieve a particular effect,
ensuring their work is both diverse and coherent. Similarly, generative
AI employs technical concepts like latent space manipulation and probabilistic
modelling —adjusting internal representations of data and predicting likely
outcomes—to ensure its generated outputs are varied and consistent.</p>
<h4>Generative AI model types</h4>
<p>Generative AI model types refer to the specific architectures and algorithms
that enable the creation of new content. Just as an art student uses various
techniques and tools to create different types of art, each model type
has its own unique way of learning and generating content. Here's a look
at some key examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GANs consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The generator creates new data, while the discriminator evaluates<sup> </sup>its
authenticity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This back-and-forth process refines the generator's output, leading to
increasingly realistic content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;VAEs learn a compressed representation of data, allowing them to
generate variations of existing content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is particularly useful for creating similar images or audio with
slight differences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transformers (GPT, T5, BERT):</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These models excel at understanding context. They pay close attention
to different parts of the input, making them ideal for natural language
tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GPT models, for instance, can generate coherent and contextually relevant
text by focusing on the relationships between words..</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diffusion Models:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This approach gradually adds noise to data, then learns to reverse the
process, refining a noisy input into a realistic image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This method is gaining popularity for its ability to produce high-quality
images and videos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why are we only hearing about this now?</h3>
<p>While the seeds of generative AI were sown in the mid-20th century, its
recent explosion in popularity is a result of several converging factors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, advancements in hardware and cloud computing have provided the
immense computational power needed to train these complex models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, open-source technologies, like Hadoop, have made scalable AI
development more accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thirdly, strategic investments and heightened public awareness have fuelled
a surge in research and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, breakthroughs in machine learning and neural networks, coupled
with the availability of vast datasets, have accelerated progress.</p>
<h3>What can Generative AI do?</h3>
<p>Generative AI offers innovative solutions and enhances productivity across
a multitude of sectors. Generative AI can generate text, images, audio,
and even code, making it a versatile tool for various applications and
industries. Here are some industries that currently use AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>

detecting anomalies in transaction patterns, thus bolstering fraud prevention
efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations of AI</h3>
<p>Despite its impressive capabilities, generative AI has several limitations.
For example, here’s what ChatGPT told us when asked for the location of
GovTech Headquarters:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="ChatGPT's (Generative AI) inaccurate response to the query on where is GovTech office in Singapore" src="/images/technews/Generative_AI__Where_it_can_go_wrong.jpg">
</div>
<p>This information isn’t exactly wrong, but it is inaccurate. Our HQ is
actually at 10 Pasir Panjang Road, while the GovTech Hive is at the Sandcrawler
instead. It's crucial to remember that AI models like ChatGPT have a knowledge
cutoff, in this case, September 2021, and therefore cannot guarantee real-time
accuracy. Therefore, always verify AI-generated content with human expertise
and reliable sources.</p>
<p>This instance highlights a broader limitations of generative AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reliance on Data:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generative AI depends heavily on existing data and patterns, limiting
its ability to handle novel or underrepresented scenarios.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pattern Recognition vs. Understanding:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AI generates content by recognising patterns, lacking true comprehension
of the information it processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential for Inaccuracy:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AI may produce inaccurate or outdated information, as shown in our example
above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dangers &amp; Risks of Generative AI</h3>
<p>While generative AI can offer significant benefits, it's crucial to acknowledge
the potential risks of AI and consequences associated with its use.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look:</p>
<h4>1. Misinformation &amp; Deepfakes</h4>
<p>Generative AI's ability to create highly convincing fake images, videos,
and audio—known as 'deepfakes'—poses a significant risk. These deepfakes
can be exploited to spread disinformation, perpetrate fraud and scams,
manipulate public opinion, and severely damage reputations. Alarmingly,
deepfakes have contributed to a rise in <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/top-five-scams-in-singapore-and-how-to-protect-yourself/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>scams in Singapore</u></a>,
with <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/identity-fraud-deepfakes-scams-ai-4761836" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>our nation ranking joint second with Cambodia for the increase in deepfake attacks in 2024.</u></a> This
trend underscores the heightened challenge of <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>scam prevention</u></a> in
our digital landscape, particularly as deepfake technology becomes increasingly
accessible.</p>
<h4>2. Plagiarism &amp; infringement</h4>
<p>The use of AI raises concerns about copyright infringement and plagiarism.
When trained on copyrighted material, AI can potentially reproduce substantial
portions or even entire works, leading to direct plagiarism. AI-generated
content can also be considered a derivative work if it is based on or substantially
similar to a copyrighted original. The line between unintentional reproduction
and deliberate plagiarism is blurred by AI, creating legal complexities.
While there are no current Singaporean court cases that directly involve
generative AI and copyright, this is an evolving legal landscape that must
be monitored.</p>
<h4>3. Unintended biases</h4>
<p>This happens because generative AI models learn to identify and replicate
patterns present in the data they are trained on. If that data reflects
existing societal biases—whether conscious or unconscious—the AI will inevitably
learn and amplify those biases in its output. For example, DALL-E, an AI
model that generates images from text prompts, has demonstrated racist
and sexist biases. Prompts for ‘CEO’ tended to generate images predominantly
of white men, while prompts for ‘personal assistant’ or ‘nurse’ often generated
images of women. Similarly, in another instance, robots programmed with
a popular artificial intelligence algorithm associated words like ‘homemaker’,
‘janitor’, or ‘criminal’ with particular ethnicities. These unintended
biases are a serious concern because they can have far-reaching consequences.
They can reinforce harmful stereotypes, leading to discriminatory practices
in areas such as hiring, lending, and even criminal justice. Therefore,
it’s crucial to be aware of how biases can propagate in AI systems and
to take steps to mitigate them.</p>
<h3>Protect yourself with responsible Generative AI use</h3>
<p>To protect yourself from the unintended consequences of using generative
AI, here are three simple pointers to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always verify and review the outputs generated by AI tools before utilising
or sharing them. Remember that human judgement remains essential for quality
control. Supplement AI with your own "sense-check," cross-referencing facts
with reliable sources such as official websites, reputable publications,
or human experts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish ethical frameworks and guidelines for the use of generative
AI, espeically if you work in a team. Promoting awareness about the potential
risks and consequences will help everyone exercise caution and responsibility
when using AI-generated content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/our-communities/stay-informed/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Stay updated on the latest developments and best practices in generative AI.</u></a> Engage
in ongoing education and training to understand the nuances of the technology
and its associated risks, ensuring that you are equipped to make informed
decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generative AI offers remarkable possibilities for enhancing productivity
and creativity, but it also poses some real risks in the workplace. Ultimately,
it’s a tool, and how skillfully it’s wielded depends on its user - you!</p>
