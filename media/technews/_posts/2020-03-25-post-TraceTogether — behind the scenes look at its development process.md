<h3>Contact tracing is essential for containing COVID-19, but not everyone can remember who they have been in contact with. </h3>
<h3>TraceTogether uses Bluetooth to identify who you have been with rather than where you have been. To develop this app, GovTech had to test dozens of different phones, calibrating wildly differing Bluetooth signal strengths.</h3>
<p>Singapore has been battling COVID-19 since its first case of infection
was confirmed on 23 January 2020. As of 23 March, 12pm, there are a total
of 509 confirmed cases in Singapore. Much of the credit for the country‚Äôs
response goes to our contact-tracing efforts. Working in collaboration
with healthcare colleagues at the hospitals and the Singapore Police Force,
the contact tracers at the Ministry of Health (MOH) have to date identified
over 8,000 close contacts who have been quarantined.</p>
<p>While contact tracing has helped Singapore contain the spread of the virus,
the process is painstaking and labour-intensive. Furthermore, even the
most strenuous efforts of contact tracers can be thwarted by lapses in
memory and the fact that there is simply no way for people to retroactively
identify strangers they might have come into contact with.</p>
<p>But most people already carry a pocket contact tracer with them at all
times: their mobile phones. Taking advantage of Singapore‚Äôs high mobile
penetration rates, GovTech has built TraceTogether, an app that uses Bluetooth
to do contact tracing with a difference.</p>

<h3>Who, not where</h3>
<p>Given the ubiquity of mobile phones and their range of communication capabilities,
they were a natural starting point when thinking about technological solutions
to the problem of contact tracing. However, many of the existing apps focus
on location-based services, using global positioning service (GPS) to identify
people who have been in close proximity to an infected person.</p>
<p>While GPS works well in wide, open spaces, it fares poorly when it comes
to indoor and highly urbanised settings, said Mr Jason Bay, Senior Director
of Government Digital Services at GovTech. ‚ÄúIf you are one floor down in
a building, your GPS location could look the same as someone in the floor
above you because of signal reflections and multipath propagation effects,‚Äù
he explained.</p>
<p>Aside from the technical challenge, using location data for contact tracing
also raises serious privacy and data security concerns. If users are hesitant
to download the app for fear of inadvertently revealing their movements,
its ability to link the dots would be greatly diminished.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo instead of attempting to tackle the issue of contact tracing by answering
the question of ‚Äòwhere,‚Äô we address contact tracing by answering the question
of ‚Äòwho‚Äô,‚Äù explained Mr Bay, who led the team behind TraceTogether. ‚ÄúAfter
all, you could argue that the virus doesn‚Äôt care where transmission happens;
it‚Äôs only interested in whether there is a hospitable host in close contact.‚Äù</p>
<p>He added that TraceTogether only needs Location Permissions to know the
relative distance between users, and the app does not collect or use any
real-world geographic location.</p>

<h3>Much more than memes</h3>
<p>Used by teens to AirDrop random pictures of memes to strangers, Bluetooth
can also be put to use in the service of contact tracing. Instead of a
meme, phones with the TraceTogether app installed will send each other
a message that contains four pieces of information: a timestamp, Bluetooth
signal strength, the phone‚Äôs model, and a temporary identifier or device
nickname.</p>
<p>If someone with TraceTogether is diagnosed with COVID-19, he or she can
simply upload their data to MOH, which will then be able to decrypt the
information and begin contacting other TraceTogether users who have been
in close contact with the confirmed COVID-19 case.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBluetooth has a maximum range on the order of about ten meters,‚Äù Mr Bay
said. ‚ÄúAnd because it is a low power signal that degrades very quickly
over distance, we can use signal strength to figure out the distance between
two phones within a reasonable margin of error.‚Äù</p>
<h3>And now for something completely different</h3>
<p>This ‚Äòfiguring out‚Äô turned out to be much more complicated than anticipated,
however. ‚ÄúIn the course of developing this app, we found out that the Bluetooth
signal strength difference between two phones can be 1,000 per cent or
even more‚Äîup to 10,000 per cent even,‚Äù Mr Bay said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo use a metaphor, some people speak with booming voices and others have
very soft voices. If you are trying to estimate the distance based on volume,
you will have to calibrate the microphone you use for each speaker ‚Äì loud
or soft. One of the hardest parts of this project was characterising and
calibrating across different models of phones,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The team ended up testing dozens of different models, enlisting the help
of partners at Nanyang Polytechnic and the Institute for Infocomm Research,
who had anechoic chambers that blocked out all other signals so that they
could measure base-level signal strength. All this was new territory for
the GovTech engineers, who are primarily software rather than hardware
engineers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCompared to the other apps and websites we have done, TraceTogether is
qualitatively and categorically different because we had to drill deep
into the Bluetooth hardware stack and access low-level functionality that
was sometimes implemented differently across different Bluetooth chipsets,‚Äù
Mr Bay said. ‚ÄúMany teammates shared that this was one of the most fulfilling
projects for them because of the amount of learning needed.‚Äù</p>
<p>He concluded that the end result is an app that will hopefully help contact
tracers uncover previously unknown close contact with COVID-19 cases and
speed up the contact tracing process.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTraceTogether does not replace the contact tracing process. Instead,
we see it as an important tool in the toolbox of contact tracers. It is
not sufficient to rely on technology alone, as we need the expertise in
public health and communicable diseases to make sense of the data collected
using this technology,‚Äù added Mr Sutowo, MOH‚Äôs Director of Analytics and
Information Management. ‚ÄúTraceTogether only works between phones that have
the app downloaded and running. The more people download and use TraceTogether,
the more effective it will be. We hope more people will use it.‚Äù he added.</p>
