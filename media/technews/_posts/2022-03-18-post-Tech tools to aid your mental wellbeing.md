<p>Cast your minds back, if you will, to the first months of 2020, when the
Covid-19 pandemic was flaring up across the world. How many of us would
have thought then that the situation would persist for a year, let alone
two?</p>
<p>Yet here we are, well into 2022, still masked, still social distancing
and still dealing with new variants of COVID.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling down, know that you’re not alone in this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">languishing</a>.
Here are some tech tools that can help keep the blues at bay and uplift
your mental wellbeing.</p>

<h3>Unplug yourself</h3>
<p>The constant barrage of technology can get overwhelming. And yes, it’s
kinda ironic to be using tech to curb tech, but if it works, why not?</p>
<p>You can start off by silencing the incessant stream of notifications coming
to your smartphone. Apple users can use the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT204321" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Do Not Disturb</a>&nbsp;mode,
which can be scheduled to kick in during the times you want to take a break
from the world. Worried that you might miss an important call in case of
an emergency? You can still allow calls from certain contacts to come through
or let the second call through if someone calls you twice within three
minutes.</p>
<p>If you’re a social media addict, consider setting a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-break" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">daily reminder</a>&nbsp;within
the Instagram app to notify you when you’ve hit your self-imposed time
limit on scrolling endless photos and videos.</p>
<p>For those who like to fall asleep to music, Spotify’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/does-spotify-have-a-sleep-timer" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sleep timer</a>&nbsp;feature
will turn off the app after a fixed time you set. That way, you can drift
off to your favourite tunes or set some soothing ambient sounds to help
you catch some sleep without worrying about your phone battery draining
overnight.</p>
<p>Speaking of sleep, it’s not just the quantity but also the quality that
matters. We all know how frustrating it is to toss and turn, drift in and
out of sleep and then get out of bed 10 hours later but none the better
rested. Sleep apps like SleepScore and Sleep Cycle help you track your
sleep patterns, set sleep goals, and provide advice on steps to take to
get a better night’s rest.</p>
<h3>Meditation</h3>

<p>We’ve all seen photos and videos of people meditating. That perfect, straight-backed
posture with legs crossed. The look of calm and focus at the same time.
An ethereal smile across the face.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to try meditation but don’t know where to start,
there are apps that can guide you.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.headspace.com/how-it-works" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Headspace</a>&nbsp;provides
mindfulness exercises to familiarise you with meditation concepts, helping
to reduce stress and improve focus.</p>
<p>Headspace also has a Netflix&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/sg/title/81328827" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">show</a>&nbsp;on
sleep, addressing misconceptions, giving tips on rest, and providing wind-down
techniques.</p>
<h3>E-therapy</h3>
<p>The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of online meetings across industries,
and mental health support is no exception. Digital tools have made such
support more accessible and because of this, more are willing to start
dealing with mental-health challenges. The good news is that Cognitive-behavioral
therapy over video and apps with programmes for treating depression and
anxiety have both been reported to reduce symptoms.</p>
<p>For those who want to find out more, you can try&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mindline.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mindline</a>,
a collaboration among several government agencies to provide a&nbsp;

home.</p>
<h3>Health monitoring through wearables</h3>

<p>Smartwatches are becoming almost as common as smartphones. But beyond
being techy and cool, they also provide several benefits like tracking
heart rate, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity to assess wellbeing.</p>
<p>Many people are already using their smartwatches together with&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.lumihealth.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LumiHealth</a>, a personalised health programme designed by the Singapore
Health Promotion Board in collaboration with Apple.</p>
<p>But did you know LumiHeatlth is not just for physical but also mental
wellbeing? The programme features mental wellbeing challenges including
tips for stress management and support tools. This includes a mindfulness
app that enables users to engage in breathing exercises while tracking
their heart rate.</p>
<h3>Take a breath for the long haul</h3>
<p>This battle with the virus has turned out to be a marathon rather than
a sprint. So it’s all the more important not to be burnt out.</p>
<p>Periodic check-ins with yourself and others around you will ensure we
are able to keep running for the long haul. Here’s to 2022 being the year
of transforming from languishing to flourishing!</p>
