<p>While the values of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have
been on a rollercoaster ride of late, the value of blockchains — the enabling
technology upholding the existence of cryptocurrencies — is on a steady
incline.</p>
<p>“There are more than 900 cryptocurrencies in the world, and initial coin
offerings are kicking off all over the place. But we’re not going to talk
about any of that today,” said Ms Staci Warden, Executive Director of the
Centre for Financial Markets, Milken Institute.</p>
<p>She was moderating a panel discussion entitled ‘The Blockchain: It's Not
All About the Money’ on 14 September at the Milken Institute Asia Summit
2017.</p>
<p>“Too many people are confusing cryptocurrencies with the underlying blockchain
technology. This panel is about the incredible promise of blockchains beyond
cryptocurrencies,” she added.</p>
<p>Sharing the stage with Ms Warden were Ms Leanne Kemp, Founder and CEO
at Everledger; Mr Greg Li, Head of Asia at the Bitfury Group; Mr Sopnendu
Mohanty, Chief Fintech Officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS);
Mr David Treat, Managing Director of Financial Services and Blockchain
Lead at Accenture; and Mr Zia Zaman, Chief Innovation Officer at MetLife
Asia.</p>
<p>The panellists, who represented a variety of economic sectors, shared
compelling use cases for blockchains, and how the technology is being deployed
in testbed or full-fledged initiatives.</p>
<h3>Just do it</h3>
<p>Known as an ‘immutable ledger’, blockchain technology is essentially a
decentralised database stored on a 7,000-node global network.</p>
<p>Hence, any transaction logged on the blockchain becomes part of a permanent
record that cannot be altered by any single party on the network.</p>
<p>Blockchains thus provide an unprecedented level of security and robustness
that lends itself well to any process requiring trust.</p>
<p>Ironically, some institutions and enterprises may shy away from blockchain
technology on the account that it is a relatively young innovation — the
full benefits and risks of blockchains remain largely unexplored.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the panelists felt that a fear of possible downsides should
not be paralysing: In the context of imperfect knowledge, the best way
forward would be to learn through experimentation.</p>
<p>“Regarding blockchains, MAS has adopted the stance of policymaking through
experimentation,” said Mr Mohanty.</p>
<p>“Rather than writing a white paper, having a public consultation and putting
up policy changes in three years, by which time the technology would have
become irrelevant or far bigger than we could understand, we thought that
we’d experiment.”</p>
<p>This thinking was shared by the Bitfury Group’s Mr Li.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge in implementing blockchain is getting people to
understand what it is. So instead of spending hours explaining blockchain,
let’s just jump straight into a pilot study,” he said.</p>
<p>But even a pilot study must have a purpose or solve a problem, and Mr
Zaman of MetLife said that one way to create value from blockchains is
to “start thinking about the customer instead of the technology”.</p>
<p>“We hear that the customer needs are: protect my assets, protect my identity
and protect something about me,” said Mr Zaman.</p>
<p>“The question that we should then ask is: how can we reduce friction in
the customer’s journey?”</p>
<h3>Winning by twinning</h3>
<p>No matter the industry, leveraging blockchains involves the concept of
a digital representation of a physical object, agreed the panelists.</p>
<p>“If we’re able to take a digital thumbprint of objects and effectively
mark them in the blockchain, it would help solve some of the problems of
fraud; how documents concerning proof of ownership and proof of value are
being tampered with and doctored,” said Ms Kemp of Everledger.</p>
<p>(Editor: Everledger is a startup that uses bitcoin blockchain technology
for fraud prevention, for high-value items like diamonds.)</p>
<p>Extending this idea of ‘digital twinning’ to land ownership, Mr Li highlighted
that blockchains present a way to create a backup of land titling records.</p>
<p>This prevents the loss of critical information during disasters, such
as the earthquake in Haiti which destroyed nearly all paper-based documentation.</p>
<p>“So, what we’ve done in the Republic of Georgia is put the whole land
titling system on the blockchain. This is not a pilot project, it is in
full production,” he said.</p>
<p>But perhaps most revolutionary is the possibility of placing human identity
on blockchains.</p>
<p>This is what Accenture is attempting to achieve with its partners, such
as Microsoft.</p>
<p>“A digital identity has to be definitively associated with the human,
so one of the first realisations was that we should be putting biometrics
and blockchains together,” said Mr Treat.</p>
<p>He noted that in addition to being exclusively personal, a digital identity
has to be portable, private and persistent. Hence, blockchains are an ideal
platform to host personal information.</p>
<p>Given the slow but certain maturation of blockchain technology, the panelists
concurred that the day would come when people would not need to fully understand
blockchains to be able to benefit from them.</p>
<p>“How many of us actually know how the internet works?” asked Mr Mohanty.</p>
<p>“We depend on it daily, but the way it functions is mostly obscure to
us. I think blockchains will eventually get to the same point.”</p>
