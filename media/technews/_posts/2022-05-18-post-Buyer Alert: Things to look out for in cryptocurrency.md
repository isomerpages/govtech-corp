<p>The recent crypto crash is the talk of the town, so it is imperative that
investors understand what they are buying into when entering the market.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency is perhaps the most well-known application of blockchain
technology and was initially touted as a foolproof system.</p>
<p>However, recent vulnerabilities that have surfaced have reinforced the
idea that investors should be aware of some potential pitfalls.</p>
<h3>1. High volatility</h3>
<p>It's been a wild ride even for bitcoin, the most prominent of all cryptocurrencies.
Just this year alone, it‚Äôs reached values of over $80,000 twice, while
plunging to just over $40,000 in between. Such swings are par for the course
and akin to investing in risky financial products, so know what you are
signing up for.</p>
<p>Seemingly stable cryptocurrency-related businesses can also fold with
little notice, as happened to the cryptocurrency trading platform Torque.
It was paying out monetary rewards like ‚Äúclockwork‚Äù (as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cnainsider/get-rich-quick-avoid-cryptocurrency-scams-losses-investment-risk-2079181" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">one investor described it</a>)
until it suddenly stopped, leaving investors in the lurch.</p>
<p>The man who ran the company says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/at-least-70-police-reports-filed-against-singaporean-run-crypto-trading" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Torque‚Äôs</a>&nbsp;downfall
was due to a rogue employee executing unauthorised trades that cost the
firm significant losses, but it‚Äôs still unclear what exactly went down,
and investigations are ongoing.</p>
<p>Similarly, the recent crash involving the algorithmic stablecoin UST shocked
investors when it was depegged from the US dollar and had its value fall
to $0 within the span of a few hours.</p>
<p>In this specific example, the ‚Äòstablecoin‚Äô failed in its promise as a
guard against volatility.</p>
<p>Mind you, UST wasn‚Äôt a minor player in the crypto ecosystem ‚Äì both UST
and LUNA were ranked in the top 10 at one point. If such a behemoth in
the crypto space can unravel within the span of a week, what of lesser-known
cryptocurrencies?</p>
<h3>2. Outright scams</h3>
<p>Then there are the outright scams that prey on victims‚Äô greed and perception
that the crypto space is a get-rich-quick wonderland.</p>
<p>A recent one capitalised on the popularity of Squid Game by naming itself
after the Netflix hit show. People who bought the SQUID token saw their
value skyrocket and it was all good, except for the inconvenient fact that
they couldn‚Äôt sell their coins. The ruse was so obvious Gizmodo published
an article titled&nbsp;<a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-squid-game-cryptocurrency-launches-as-obvious-scam-1847961584" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">‚ÄúNew Squid Game Cryptocurrency Launches as Obvious Scam‚Äù</a>,
pointing out a fake endorsement from Elon Musk and a poorly written white
paper, among other tell-tale signs.</p>
<p>Indeed, a few days after the article was published, The coin‚Äôs value crashed
after its creators&nbsp;ran away&nbsp;with investor proceeds in what is
known as a&nbsp;‚Äúrug pull‚Äù.</p>
<p>Do your research before plunging in. And no, a few articles from reputable
news outlets don‚Äôt guarantee that what you buy is legit.</p>
<p>Another type of scam is a spin on the classic wire transfer scam, where
the victim is persuaded to transfer money to the scammer. Only this time
the transfer is through cryptocurrency, because the transaction is harder
to trace and there won‚Äôt be an alert bank employee who can smell something
fishy going on and intervene.</p>
<h3>3. Hacked wallets</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency is big money these days, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/08/10/more-than-600-million-stolen-in-ethereum-and-other-cryptocurrencies-marking-one-of-cryptos-biggest-hacks-ever/?sh=46dde6a57f62" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">hundreds of millions</a>&nbsp;of
dollars worth of coins have been lost to hackers targeting crypto platforms
and wallets.</p>
<p>Bad actors have various ways to steal digital currencies, ranging from
sophisticated attacks that exploit system vulnerabilities to more ‚Äúlow-tech‚Äù
methods like phishing and stealing passwords.</p>
<p>For an added layer of security, consider getting what is known as a&nbsp;cold
wallet, akin to a thumb drive, which stores your cryptocurrency completely
offline.</p>
<h3>4. Forgotten password</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you are your worst enemy. Some people have been unable to access
millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency because they‚Äôve&nbsp;forgotten
their passwords&nbsp;to their digital wallets or lost the piece of paper
upon which they were written.</p>
<p>It must be a special kind of pain to be so near, yet so far from life-changing
wealth.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs no perfect solution to this issue. Memorise or have just one copy
of your password, and you risk forgetting or losing it. The more copies
of your passwords you make, the higher the chance it‚Äôll be discovered and
stolen. At least now that the worth of cryptocurrency is so well-known,
it‚Äôs much less likely you‚Äôll treat your password casually.</p>
<h3>5. High potential, high risk</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies look set to gain in importance. So it‚Äôs completely understandable
if you are exploring the world of crypto and are excited by the high potential
of this tech. However, being aware of the risks involved and how to manage
them is essential and will ensure that your crypto journey doesn‚Äôt end
up as a cautionary tale.</p>
