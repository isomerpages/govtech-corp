<p>Let’s face it: paper parking coupons are a pain. From scrounging around
to find one in your car to accidentally punching out the wrong date, there
are many things that drivers in Singapore love to hate about this decades-old
system.</p>
<p>The good news is, paper coupons are a special kind of pain. “This is a
very pertinent, concrete and well-defined pain point for the public that
we can address,” said Mr Li Hongyi, deputy director, product and engineering
at GovTech.</p>
<p>And address it they did—Mr Li and his team at GovTech developed Parking.sg,
an app that liberates you from paper coupons, letting you pay for parking
through your mobile device instead. Made with the support of the Ministry
of National Development (MND), the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)
and the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the app went live in October
2017 to mostly positive reception. Speaking at the Public Sector Infocomm
Seminar on 20 March 2018, Mr Li took the audience through the app’s development
journey, detailing his team’s thought processes, challenges faced and lessons
learned. If you weren’t there, we’ve got your back—read on for a behind-the-scenes
look at how Parking.sg went from prototype to production.</p>

<h3><strong>Phase 1: The prototype - helping stakeholders say “I want that thing”</strong></h3>
<p>“Our team’s job is to actively identify, design and evangelise ideas that
improve the public good,” said Mr Li. This means that when the team has
an idea, it often dives straight into building a prototype rather than
first pitching it to higher-ups and waiting for their go-ahead, he added.</p>
<p>“If you have something concrete that people can touch, feel and give feedback
on, that actually speeds things up a lot in terms of getting actual users
to your product.”</p>
<p>The first working prototype of Parking.sg was “as bare bones as you can
get,” consisting only of an ‘enforcer app’ that checked pictures of licence
plates against a manually edited database.</p>
<p>At this stage, something rudimentary will suffice; concerns like polishing,
scalability, maintainability and analytics can be addressed later on in
the development timeline, said Mr Li.</p>
<p>“The whole point of the prototype phase is to bridge the gap between your
imagination and that of stakeholders. You’re trying to figure out how to
sell your idea to someone who doesn't see it yet… You need to make your
understanding of the topic more visceral for [non-techies] to be able to
consume. They should be able to just point to it and say ‘I want that thing’.”</p>
<h3><strong>[TL;DR] Phase 1: The prototype</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: To bridge the gap between the developers’ imagination
and that of stakeholders</p>
<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong>: Prototype first, pitch later; being
unpolished is OK</p>
<h3><strong>Phase 2: The proposal</strong></h3>
<p>To develop a concrete proposal for building the app, developers must get
to a version that can be tested on actual users, who can then provide early
feedback on what works and what doesn’t, said Mr Li.</p>
<p>“You’re trying to figure out very early on whether you're on the right
track. With this ‘fail fast’ philosophy, you can’t guarantee that you’ll
be right, but you can guarantee that all your bad ideas will fail very
quickly.”</p>
<p>For example, one of the team’s original ideas was to incorporate computer
vision into the app, allowing parking enforcement officers to snap a picture
of a licence plate and have the app determine if its driver had paid for
parking.</p>
<p>But after shadowing an experienced officer, they realised that she was
so good at reading paper coupons that it took her just seconds to figure
out whether a driver had overparked—in other words, much faster than any
computer vision solution they could code. The team ended up finding a not-so-fancy
but much more effective way of speeding up enforcement: by listing the
licence plate numbers of cars with valid parking, so that officers could
simply walk down a road and pick out which vehicles were not on the list.</p>

<h3><strong>[TL;DR] Phase 2: The proposal</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: To get your project in the hands of actual users
Lessons learned: Fail fast; talk to experienced users on the ground; sometimes,
dumb tech is the best tech</p>

<h3><strong>Before phase 3: Getting the green light</strong></h3>
<p>What finally got Parking.sg off the ground had little to do with the app’s
design or utility; instead, the trigger was the government’s December 2016
decision to increase public parking charges, said Mr Li. Drivers were unhappy
not only about the price increase, but also about the inconvenience of
having to switch to the new 60-cent paper coupon denomination.</p>
<p>At this point, the relevant government agencies, who already knew about
the Parking.sg prototype from talks with GovTech, asked the team if it
could develop the app for public use. “We were ready to push the project
live,” said Mr Li, noting that the team’s preparation had paid off.</p>
