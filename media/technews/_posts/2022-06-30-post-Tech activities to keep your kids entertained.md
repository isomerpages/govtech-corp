<p>The June holidays have come to an end and if you‚Äôre a parent, those words
are absolutely music to your ears.</p>
<p>But now that the coding boot camps are over and the holiday activities
have all but run their course, how do you keep your kids entertained and
engaged apart from school work?</p>
<p>Well, we‚Äôre here to help with a list of fun tech activities that will
keep the young ones entertained ‚Äì and give you a much-needed breather.
Who knows, the children may even develop some useful lifelong tech skills
along the way. You can thank us later.</p>

<h3>1. Learn coding</h3>
<p>Coding skills are all the rage now in the job market, but it‚Äôs not just
all work and no play. There are quite a few learning centres offering coding
lessons for children of different age groups. But better still, there are
also tons of free learning materials online.</p>
<p>Case in point, check out our very own&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GovTechSG" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GovTech YouTube channel</a>,
which has instructional videos aimed at teaching children how to code.</p>

</div>
<p>And if you think Python or Java are too intimidating for your child, fret
not as lessons primarily use programming languages aimed at children such
as Scratch.</p>
<h3>2. Be a drone pilot</h3>
<p>Sorry Maverick, drones are truly the future. And you and your little ones
can experience that future together at the Singapore Science Centre, where
you can steer not just drones but rovers too.</p>
<p>At the Drone-Rover area, a specially designed arena mixing indoor and
outdoor elements will challenge your children‚Äôs piloting skills in manoeuvring
over several obstacles.</p>
<p>This could be the moment to spark their interest in joining a competition
such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stemacademy.sg/drone-odyssey-challenge" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Drone Odyssey Challenge</a>&nbsp;in
August, where participants work together in teams to programme their Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to perform various tasks under given scenarios.</p>
<h3>3. Learn about 3D printing</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôre already at the Science Centre, you can also check out its section
on 3D printing and how this technology has several medical applications.</p>
<p>For a more hands-on session, there are many 3D printing workshops to choose
from, though be sure to check with the organiser if there is a minimum
age for participation as 3D printing involves machinery that must be handled
with care.</p>
<p>The National Library, for instance, organises periodic 3D printing workshops
but participants must be at least 15 years old.</p>
<h3>4. Watch robots in action</h3>
<p>Robots are cool. It‚Äôs why Transformers toys have fascinated children across
generations.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/community/showcases/playscape" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation Playscape</a>&nbsp;at
the Science Centre features robots galore, including robots that you can
programme to dance and Rubik‚Äôs cube-solving robotic arms.</p>
<p>The playscape also goes beyond just robots. Get a complete tech immersion
with exhibits on sensors, geospatial tech, biometrics, blockchain, AI,
user experience, and Augmented/Virtual Reality/Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR).</p>
<h3>5. Check out how the Smart Nation is built</h3>
<p>Speaking of Smart Nation, head on down to the URA Centre to explore the&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/community/showcases/cityscape" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation Cityscape</a>.</p>
<p>After being wowed by the model buildings forming a miniature rendering
of Singapore‚Äôs landscape, they‚Äôll learn about how technology is increasingly
powering our daily city lives, including supporting the planning of towns
and amenities and being embedded in our infrastructure.</p>
<h3>6. Follow Smart Nation Builder ‚Äì a moving roadshow</h3>
<p>Talk about fun on wheels. Head down to the Sports Hub on the final weekend
of this year‚Äôs June holidays to catch the Smart Nation Builder, a 12m-long
truck fitted with interactive game stations for members of the public to
learn more about Singapore‚Äôs tech initiatives and digital Government services.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll also get to test prototypes and give feedback about upcoming digital
government services.</p>
<p>If you already have plans for this weekend and want to catch the Smart
Nation Builder at its next location, this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/community/showcases/builder" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">site</a>&nbsp;has
regular updates on where the truck is headed next.</p>
<h3>Today‚Äôs play sets up long-term interest</h3>
<p>The best part of the tech activities listed above is that they set your
kids up for a long-term interest in technology.</p>
<p>Before you know it, they may be the ones bugging you to sign them up for
more courses and programmes that will keep them occupied for many a weekend
and school holiday to come.</p>
<p>They‚Äôll be getting good entertainment and education at the same time.
And, of course, there‚Äôs the added perk of you getting some me time.</p>
<h4>Now that‚Äôs a good investment of your time and effort.</h4>
