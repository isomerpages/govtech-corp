<p>Imagine being a researcher or city planner with the power to fly through
and experience a digital version of Singapore with every detail reproduced
true-to-life ‚Äî from street names and traffic information, to population
data and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the SimCity game brought to life but with real-world properties.</p>
<p>Thanks to an ambitious project known as <a href="https://www.sla.gov.sg/articles/press-releases/2014/virtual-singapore-a-3d-city-model-platform-for-knowledge-sharing-and-community-collaboration" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Virtual Singapore</u></a>,
scientists and urban planners can ‚Äî at the touch of a button ‚Äî conduct
experiments and run simulations through a data-rich, 3D model of Singapore.</p>
<p>Here are five things you should know about Virtual Singapore and how it
could impact urban planning in the <a href="/media/technews/smart-nation-city-scape/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation</a>.</p>

<h3>1. The Nation‚Äôs Data-Driven Identical Twin</h3>
<p>Put simply, Virtual Singapore is a 3D digital model of Singapore, built
in intricate detail. Users can navigate through this virtual city and explore
it like never before, with access to all kinds of information and points
of view.</p>
<p>In addition, the model is also crammed with real-time, dynamic data (more
on that later), which can be used in simulations and virtual tests of new
solutions to urban planning problems.</p>
<p>Virtual Singapore is a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.nrf.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>National Research Foundation (NRF)</u></a>,
the <a href="https://www.sla.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singapore Land Authority (SLA)</u></a>,
which provides topographical mapping data for the 3D model, and the Government
Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), which provides information and
communications technology expertise.</p>
<p>To build an easily navigable virtual city, NRF is also collaborating with
French software company <a href="https://www.3ds.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Dassault Syst√®mes</u></a>, which specialises
in 3D design software.</p>
<p>The areas of Yuhua and Teck Ghee have already been mapped and modelled.
Up next: Virtual Ang Mo Kio, which will be completed over the next few
months, said Mr George Loh, Director (Programmes) at NRF.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOther areas in Singapore will be modelled from mid-2017,‚Äù Mr Loh told
TechNews.</p>
<h3>2. Virtual 3D Model is Detailed and Semantically Enriched</h3>
<p>This means that the computer understands the real-world meaning and context
of the information ‚Äî when looking at a representation of a building, for
example, it knows what kind of building it is, and what kind of roof, walls,
doors and windows it has.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe fact that the computer knows all this information means that more
advanced simulation and analysis can be carried out,‚Äù Dr Ronnie Lee, deputy
director of GovTech‚Äôs Geospatial Specialist Office, told TechNews.</p>
<p>With both details and semantics, researchers can use the Virtual Singapore
platform to run virtual experiments.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou could for example find all the roof surfaces for buildings of a certain
height in a certain area, or find all the wall surfaces orientated at a
certain bearing and calculate the amount of sunlight falling on them,‚Äù
said Dr Lee. This would indicate how much energy you could expect to generate
by installing solar panels on the building.</p>
<p>Simulations could also be used for disaster prevention; for example, modelling
could be used to predict the impact of flooding, and hence guide the development
of pre-emptive strategies to mitigate it.</p>
<h3>3. Smart Nation data in real-time</h3>
<p>Static 3D models limit the kinds of simulations users can do.</p>
<p>Instead, Virtual Singapore is a dynamic model, meaning that it incorporates
all sorts of real-time data from the network of sensors that have already
been installed across the country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe platform is able to connect to any real-time data,‚Äù said Dr Lee.
‚ÄúFor example, environmental sensor data can be piped over at regular intervals
to a data store. Analysis and simulations can then be carried out on this
data.‚Äù</p>
<p>Air quality, temperature and noise data, for example, could be used to
simulate urban pollution and help guide strategies to reduce it.</p>
<p>Other types of environmental data could also be used to simulate wind
flow and urban heat island effects, which could then be used for urban
planning purposes.</p>
<h3>4. Allowing for Different Views of the Cityscape</h3>
<p></p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Virtual Singapore allows for different views of the Cityscape." src="/images/technews/5-things-to-know-about-virtual-singapore-part-1.png">
</div>
<p>By layering all kinds of data on top of a 3D landscape, Virtual Singapore
gives city planners a holistic, all-seeing view of the city-state.</p>
<p>This lets them draw connections between disparate parts of the city, and
explore potential far-reaching impacts of proposed changes.</p>
<p>For example, before urban development initiatives ‚Äî such as building a
new highway or sports stadium ‚Äî are implemented, their impact on traffic,
pollution and other factors can be simulated and assessed.</p>
<p>The platform is also meant to be a collaborative one, where different
sectors can come together to work on complex problems facing Singapore.</p>
<p>When completed, likely in 2018, experts from the Government, academia
and the private sector will be able to access and navigate through Virtual
Singapore, while the general public will have to wait a little longer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe platform is targeted to be ready by 2018 for use by government agencies.
Thereafter, it will be deployed to the public progressively,‚Äù said NRF‚Äôs
Mr Loh.</p>
<h3>5. The Sky‚Äôs the Limit for Virtual Singapore</h3>
<p>With so much data underpinning it, the sky‚Äôs the limit when it comes to
what Virtual Singapore could potentially do.</p>
<p>One application could be to identify the safest route for cyclists to
use ‚Äî one which bypasses heavy traffic, for example.</p>
<p>This is a more complicated problem than finding the shortest route, which
would not necessarily be the safest.</p>
<p>Another possibility, which takes advantage of the detailed 3D information
in the model, is drone flight path planning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA virtual drone flight path can be developed in the virtual world, with
real-world coordinates,‚Äù said Dr Lee.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis will allow planners to determine the best view for capture.‚Äù</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs not all that can be done with Virtual Singapore.</p>
<p>NRF‚Äôs Mr Loh added: ‚ÄúPublic agencies will continue to identify suitable
modelling and simulation applications for Virtual Singapore. Ideas from
the public could also be gathered through activities such as hackathons.‚Äù</p>
