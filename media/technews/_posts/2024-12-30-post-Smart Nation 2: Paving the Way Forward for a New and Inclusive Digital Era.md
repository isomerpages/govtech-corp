<p>As we approach the end of 2024, it is fitting to close this year by focusing
on the importance of a refreshed Smart Nation blueprint for the years ahead.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/sn1/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">first Smart Nation initiative</a> was
announced in 2014 by former Prime Minister (PM) Lee Hsien Loong, which
sought to transform Singapore into a digitally-enabled nation where technology
is integrated into different aspects of life for all Singaporeans and businesses.
This has been largely successful with cashless payments being the norm,
increased internet connectivity and broadband speeds, and <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/digital-services/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">more government services becoming digitised</a> among
others.</p>
<p>However, changing technological trends necessitate changes in the Smart
Nation blueprint, resulting in Smart Nation 2.0. Let’s explore the main
goals of Smart Nation 2.0 and the efforts being made to achieve these goals.</p>

<h3>What does being a Smart Nation mean?</h3>
<p>Being a <a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/vision/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Nation</a> means
<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/how-data-engineering-powers-insights-for-public-health-in-singapore/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">leveraging technology in optimal ways</a>to improve the quality of life
for all citizens, create economic opportunities, and foster a more connected
and inclusive society. It embodies the vision where digital tools and innovations
are seamlessly integrated into daily life, making interactions with government
services, businesses, and communities more efficient and meaningful.</p>
<p>A Smart Nation focuses on using advanced technology to address real challenges
and improve the quality of life for all.</p>
<p>In Singapore, this has meant transforming government services into user-friendly
digital experiences, fostering cashless transactions, and building <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-businesses/smart-city-tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">smart infrastructure that enhances urban living</a>.
For example, sensors in housing estates ensure swift maintenance and digital
platforms like <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/tracetogether-behind-the-scenes-look-at-its-development-process/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> demonstrate
how technology can be a critical enabler during crises like the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>At its core, being a Smart Nation reflects a collective whole-of-nation
effort. It requires active participation from government, businesses, and
citizens. It’s about embracing innovation, fostering digital literacy,
and ensuring that no one is left behind as society progresses into a new
digital era. This is what it means to create a thriving digital future
for all.</p>

</div>
<h3>Why is Smart Nation 2.0 necessary?</h3>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In Smart Nation 1.0, we focused on building up capabilities and encouraging
the use of technology. For our next phase, or Smart Nation 2.0, we aim
to sharpen our focus and use technology more effectively to transform our
future and shape our nation together.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- PM Lawrence Wong at the <a href="https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lawrence-Wong-at-the-Launch-of-Smart-Nation" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">launch of Smart Nation 2.0 in Oct 2024</a>
</p>
<p>A refreshed Smart Nation 2.0 is necessary because the technological landscape
has evolved significantly since Singapore first embarked on its Smart Nation
journey back in 2014. The rise of generative AI, the ubiquity of smartphones,
and the growing influence of digital platforms on every aspect of life
present both new opportunities and challenges. To stay ahead of technological
trends, Singapore must adapt its strategies to harness these advancements
effectively.</p>

<h4>Trust</h4>
<p>Trust in Smart Nation 2.0 entails building confidence in digital systems
through <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/our-capabilities/cybersecurity/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">robust cybersecurity measures</a> to
combat online harms, and initiatives to ensure safe digital experiences
for all. Hence, laws and systems will also be updated to address new risks.</p>
<p>An example of new legislation is the <a href="https://www.mddi.gov.sg/media-centre/press-releases/new-digital-infrastructure-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Infrastructure Act (DIA)</a>,
which will be introduced in 2025 and the establishment of a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/harmful-content-online-new-agency-cyberbullying-4603406" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">new government agency</a> to
address emerging threats like non-consensual sharing of intimate images
and cyberbullying.</p>
<p>The DIA aims to make our digital systems, like data centres and <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/software-development/government-on-commercial-cloud/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">cloud services</a>,
more reliable and secure. This means protecting them from cyberattacks,
as well as physical threats like fires or floods.</p>
<p>The DIA would require companies to report incidents and meet certain security
standards, helping to prevent disruptions and ensuring a smooth digital
experience for everyone.Moreover, individuals must also be empowered with
the knowledge and tools to use technology responsibly. This enables Singaporeans
to navigate the digital landscape with confidence, assured that their safety
and privacy are safeguarded.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of government tools and systems <strong>to enhance the safety and security of Singaporeans:</strong>
