<p>As we approach the end of 2024, it is fitting to close this year by focusing
on the importance of a refreshed Smart Nation blueprint for the years ahead.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/sn1/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">first Smart Nation initiative</a> was
announced in 2014 by former Prime Minister (PM) Lee Hsien Loong, which
sought to transform Singapore into a digitally-enabled nation where technology
is integrated into different aspects of life for all Singaporeans and businesses.
This has been largely successful with cashless payments being the norm,
increased internet connectivity and broadband speeds, and <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/digital-services/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">more government services becoming digitised</a> among
others.</p>
<p>However, changing technological trends necessitate changes in the Smart
Nation blueprint, resulting in Smart Nation 2.0. Letâ€™s explore the main
goals of Smart Nation 2.0 and the efforts being made to achieve these goals.</p>
