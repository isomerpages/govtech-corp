<p>With the new SingPass Mobile app, you don‚Äôt need to enter long passwords
and carry your token around. What‚Äôs more, the app just launched two new
features. You now get faster access to your important information and favourite
digital services!</p>
<h3>1. Forget about long passwords and having ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that token?!‚Äù moments</h3>
<p>Built for convenience, the SingPass Mobile app doesn‚Äôt require you to
memorise long passwords or key in an SMS one-time password to log in.</p>
<p>You simply have to scan your fingerprint, or hold up your mobile phone
for a selfie (facial recognition for selected smartphones), or enter a
6-digit passcode. You can even leave your OneKey token behind when travelling,
as all you need is your mobile phone and internet connection to transact
online.</p>
<h3>2. View your information at a glance</h3>

</div>
<p>With the MyInfo Profile feature, you can view your passport expiration
date, CPF contribution history, HDB property details, and more, all in
one place!</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt need to switch between multiple screens to retrieve your personal
information. What a way to save time!</p>
<p>When you select ‚ÄòView MyInfo Profile‚Äô in the SingPass Mobile app, you‚Äôll
be prompted to verify your identity using biometric authentication or your
six-digit passcode. Thereafter, your profile information will load automatically.
The list of information available will grow over time, so keep an eye out
for it.</p>
<h3>3. Access digital services with a tap</h3>

</div>
<p>Even as SingPass Mobile becomes increasingly multifunctional, ease of
use remains a top priority. Hence, the SingPass Mobile team has implemented
an intuitive navigation system for users in the form of Login Shortcuts.</p>
<p>When you launch the SingPass Mobile app, you will see icons of some frequently
used digital services, such as those offered by CPF, HDB and NS Portal.
Tap on the service you are interested in, verify yourself using biometrics
or a passcode, and you‚Äôll be immediately directed to the relevant services
without having to search for them. More shortcuts will be added progressively
to make your experience even better.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Download or update your SingPass Mobile app
now!</p>
<p><em>Have security concerns? Not to worry, SingPass Mobile has stringent security measures in place to detect and prevent unauthourised access to your personal data. For example, when the app identifies a potential security breach or the presence of malicious software on a mobile device, it will prompt the user to exit the app.</em>

<p><em>SingPass Mobile is part of the Singapore Government‚Äôs National Digital Identity initiative, which aims to provide more convenience and security for citizens when transacting online.</em>
