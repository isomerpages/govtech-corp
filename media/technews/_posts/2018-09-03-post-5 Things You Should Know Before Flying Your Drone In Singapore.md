<p>TL:DR: Flying a recreational drone can be a great pastime, not to mention
the awe-inspiring photos that can be taken from above. But flying safely
and responsibly is just as important as having fun. Here are five things
you should take note of before your drone takes off.</p>
<hr>
<p>So you’ve seen beautiful aerial photographs on the internet taken by drones,
and the shutterbug in you is itching to get in on the action. You place
your order for a camera-toting quadcopter on the internet, and the moment
the delivery man hands it over to you, you can’t wait to take it out for
a spin.</p>
<p>But hold your horses! While flying a drone might seem like a no-brainer,
there are some rules to abide by and best practices to follow so that your
flight of fantasy does not turn into a nightmare for yourself or those
around you.</p>
<p>Here are five things you should pay attention to before letting your drone
take off.</p>
<h3>1. Read the instruction manual</h3>
<p>This might seem like stating the obvious, but the drone comes with an
instruction manual for a reason. Just because you are proficient with a
remote-controlled car does not necessarily mean that you can fly a drone.
After all, drones move in a whole new dimension—up.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve flown a different model of drone before, do remember that
each drone is unique, and there may be certain quirks or features you need
to know about. Key things to familiarise yourself with include the drone’s
maximum flight time and the maximum transmission range of the remote controller.
To be safe, don’t push the limits of either one of these parameters.</p>
<h3>2. Check the weather forecast</h3>
<p>Unlike passenger-carrying vessels, the smaller size of drones means that
they are more susceptible to the effects of weather. Intuitively, strong
winds make it more difficult to control the flight path of drones, but
even factors such as temperature could have an effect on drone performance.</p>
<p>For example, on a hot day, the rotors on the drone need to work harder
to generate lift. This means that the battery drains more quickly and overheating
of the electronics could occur, so you may want to factor in more downtime
between flights. At the other end of the spectrum, cold weather reduces
the efficiency of the drone’s battery, which could cut flight time by as
much as half. In either extreme, it may be best to keep your drone grounded.</p>
<h3>3. Create a pre-flight checklist</h3>
<p>Just as real pilots run through a pre-flight checklist before takeoff,
responsible drone pilots ought to have their own checklist to tick off
too before letting their drones leave terra firma. Has the drone battery
been charged? Are all the component parts of the drone firmly fastened?
How’s the GPS signal in the area? What’s the weather like (see point 2)?</p>
<p>These questions are by no means exhaustive, but the point is that checklists
are a safety net to prevent drone accidents from occurring. As an additional
measure, you could also make your drone to hover at a low altitude for
thirty seconds before performing any more complex flight manoeuvres. This
will allow you to check for any flight stability issues before proceeding
further.</p>
<h3>4. Maintain line of sight</h3>
<p>Once you’ve gone through your checklist and ensured that your drone is
fit for flight, do take note of the height limits for recreational drone
activity. According to the <a href="https://www.caas.gov.sg/public-passengers/unmanned-aircraft" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore’s (CAAS) guidelines</a>,
drones should fly below 200 feet (which is about 60 metres, or 12 storeys
of an HDB apartment block), beyond which an activity permit is required
for each flight session or block of repeated flight sessions.</p>
<p>Also, the rule of thumb for drone flights is to never let the drone out
of sight. If you can see your drone, you’ll be able to adjust its flight
path to avoid obstacles, or bring it ‘home’ when its batteries are nearly
exhausted.</p>
<h3>5. Obey the law</h3>
<p>Just because the sky’s the limit for drones doesn’t mean that there are
no limits on the airspace within which they can be flown. CAAS states that
drones are not allowed over “restricted, danger, protected, [or] prohibited
areas and not within five kilometers of an aerodrome or airbase”.</p>
<p>In essence, stay away from Changi Airport, police camps and the military
bases and you’ll be fine. Otherwise, be prepared to pay a fine—those caught
violating the Unmanned Aircraft Act (which has been effect since 2015)
can be fined up to S$20,000 or face a one-year jail term, depending on
the area infringed upon. These penalties apply even if the drone operator
was not aware that an airspace is off-limits.</p>
