<p>This yearâ€™s Data Arcade Tournament (DAT) has been the largest since its
inception in 2018.</p>
<p>Conceived to help public officers get familiarised (and comfortable) with
data analytics and visualisation using tools such as Qlik Sense and Tableau,
2020â€™s event saw 400 teams competing against one another. For reference,
last yearâ€™s tournament involved just 144 teams.</p>

</p>
<p>The origins of DAT are humble â€“ it was first conceived to help push for
upskilling on good visual analytics skills using modern BI (Business Intelligence)
tools.</p>
<p>The intentions were two-fold: Firstly, it would help public servants quickly
explore complex data and piece together a compelling narrative with good
data storytelling. Secondly, it was meant to be a rallying cry across the
public service to see data as an enabler â€“ which would lead to a stronger
data culture within the agency.</p>
<p>Well, it seems like the rallying cry worked.</p>
<p>In 2020, to cater to the increased demand, individual agencies hosted
their own runs of the competition for the first time. Teams would first
compete within their agency, and the top teams would face off in the last
rounds against their counterparts from the rest of government.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone deals with data on a daily basis. To help level
the playing field, workshops were provided for those who were new to visual
analytics.</p>
<p>We spoke to Klarissa Khor and Haikal Yeo (both from the Ministry of Education)
to find out more about their experience. Their team, Sample Size 2, eventually
emerged victorious at the finals under the Tableau Track.</p>
<h3>How did you juggle with the involvement in the Data Arcade Tournament amid full work commitments?</h3>
<p>Work definitely did not stop even as we participated in the Data Arcade
Tournament. We were fortunate to have understanding colleagues, especially
during the finals when we were away for two full days. But the preparation
leading up to it was usually left to small pockets of time when we were
both available, which would usually mean sacrificing a bit of sleep to
work at night and over the weekends.</p>
<h3>What was the most challenging part of the live hackathon, and why?</h3>
<p>The sheer amount of data took us by surprise. We had certain ideas in
mind which worked on the sample data set, but when it was a million lines
or so, we could only execute about 75% of our game plan, especially since
our computers did not have enough processing power to plough through the
data quickly. It also makes very stark which methods would work with such
a large data set, as only the most efficient ones were capable of giving
us the results we wanted in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<h3>Did having a community of fellow participants, support from the organising team and dedicated mentors help? In what way?</h3>
<p>Definitely, MOE x DAT 2020 team supported us with Tableau Doctor sessions
and we attended more than one session as we had quite a number of queries
on certain functionalities we were exploring and were unsure whether it
was even doable. The sessions enlightened us to think about possible workarounds,
and that opened up a lot of possibilities when thinking of alternatives.</p>
<p>Our mentor from Tableau was also very helpful and pointed us to many resources
that showed us lots of data visualisation charts which are quite different
from the typical ones, and very aesthetically pleasing. For example, our
mentor suggested for us to use small multiple charts and it was very helpful
to slice the data in so many different ways and analyse them all at once.</p>
<h3>What did you find most enjoyable about the Data Arcade Tournament?</h3>
<p>Data storytelling was the most enjoyable part of the whole process. Having
the data in front of you is one thing but stringing it all together in
one coherent narrative in a way that sticks with the audience is another.</p>
<p>It was also very satisfying to hear that some of our friends have been
actively using our original submission on P1 places and property prices
for their own planning purposes.</p>
<h3>If somebody is thinking of going for the Data Arcade Tournament next year, what would you say to them?</h3>
<p>Just give it a go.</p>
<p>Get your hands dirty, feel a little stuck â€“ thatâ€™s all part of the process.
There is some unspoken satisfaction when you have an idea in your head
and manage to put together into a dashboard.</p>
<p>At the end of the exploration process, be unafraid to strike out some
ideas as you sharpen the focus of your dashboard. It is better to be focused
than to have too many cluttered ideas with no clear direction!</p>
<h3>Beyond the tournament, do you have any plans on developing your visualisation skills or perhaps sharing your experience with your peers?</h3>
<p>We plan to continue keeping up with our skills in Tableau and hope that
we can incorporate Tableau into our existing work to visualise data in
an interactive way that provides quick insights.</p>
<h3>Top tips from the MINDEF teams under the Qlik Track!</h3>

</p>
<p>The top teams under the Qlik Track of the tournament also shared their
experience and gave some quick tips for public officers who are keen to
participate in the tournament for the year 2021.</p>
<p>Ng Wan Ling: Itâ€™s important to frame your story from the onset. Come up
with a broad storyline to scope your analysis, make the assumptions and
set the hypotheses before you dive right into the visualisation of the
datasets. That will create a dashboard that is easier to comprehend and
use.</p>
<p>Rebecca Loo: Our team prepared plenty ofdata scripts and a few template
dashboards beforehand as reference and that definitely eased our stress
during the five hour live hackathon. We cannot emphasise enough the importance
of early preparation!</p>
<p>Michelle Lee: Ask whenever possible! There were many functions of Qlik
we werenâ€™t aware of, but by asking our mentors from Qlik, we managed to
bridge those knowledge gaps, and this benefitted our end result immensely.
Asking others, especially experts, usually provides a different perspective
that leads us closer to the ideal destination.</p>
