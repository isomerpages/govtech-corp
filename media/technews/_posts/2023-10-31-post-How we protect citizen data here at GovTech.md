<p>Ask people what happens in October, and they won’t think twice before
saying Halloween. But as it turns out, October isn’t just about Jack ‘O’
Lanterns and pumpkin spice lattes.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2004</a>, it
has also been Cybersecurity Awareness Month.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing. Every year that goes by, the focus on cybersecurity
becomes more relevant because our lives are pretty much digital diaries
these days.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, we sat down with Lim Rui Sian, GovTech Cyber Security
Engineer, who’s all about making sure our data stays where it should be:
safe and secure.</p>
<h3>What is the overarching cybersecurity strategy of GovTech when it comes to safeguarding citizen data?</h3>
<p>GovTech’s overarching cybersecurity strategy to enhance data security
is to govern the management of data in all stages of its lifecycle, support
efforts to safely use and exploit data, and encourage effective data management
practices. There are data protection policies that provide governance on
how personal data is managed in Agencies. Our team ensures that all data
that passes through our product is encrypted in all states (at rest and
in transit).</p>
<h3>What measures are in place to detect and prevent unauthorised access to databases containing citizen information?</h3>
<p>Data sharing across the government is a huge opportunity for services
to be more streamlined and convenient for the citizens. Compared to just
a few years ago, citizens now can access a whole bunch of services at their
fingertips. But there are also risks. Our role is to balance the increasing
complexity of securing the data and citizen usability. At GovTech, we’ve
implemented several measures to detect and prevent unauthorised access
to databases containing citizen information.</p>
<p>One such measure is the use of audit logs, which can be exported and retained
centrally using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-on-commercial-cloud/overview.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC)</a>&nbsp;depending
on product requirements. Additionally, we provide agencies with guidelines
on proper network segmentation to ensure that databases are not exposed
to the internet and that only traffic from restricted sources can access
them. These measures help to ensure that citizen information is protected
from unauthorised access.</p>
<h3>How do you keep your security measures updated to defend against ever-evolving cyber threats?</h3>
<p>To defend against ever-evolving cyber threats, we prioritise innovation
and agility when creating solutions and security measures. We also stay
up to date with the latest security threats and best practices through
ongoing education and training for our employees, as well as regular security
audits and assessments. Also, we work closely with industry partners and
government agencies to stay informed about emerging threats and new security
technologies. This allows us to continuously update and improve our security
measures to stay ahead of the latest threats.</p>
<h3>How is AI or machine learning utilised in your cybersecurity measures, if at all?</h3>
<p>Yes, we use AI and machine learning to detect and respond to security
threats in real time. This includes using machine learning algorithms to
analyse network traffic and identify potential threats, as well as using
AI-powered security tools to automate threat detection and response. For
example: We use AI to enhance the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/files/Factsheet%20about%20the%20Government%20Cyber%20Security%20Operations%20Centre.pdf" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Government Cyber Security Operations Centre (GCSOC).</a>&nbsp;We
collaborate with key partners and also our partner services – this helps
us expose threats quickly and mitigate threats early by initiating automated
responses.</p>
<h3>What kind of regular audits or assessments does GovTech undergo to ensure cybersecurity compliance?</h3>
<p>Products from GovTech are subject to regular security audits and assessments
periodically to ensure compliance with industry standards and government
regulations. These include scoping the engagements for rigorous penetration
tests and vulnerability assessments. In addition, GovTech has a programme
to leverage the expertise of the community by encouraging white hats to
highlight vulnerabilities in our products. This further strengthens the
overall security posture of our software products.</p>
<h3>Have you ever had to recover from a security incident, and what lessons were learned that might benefit others?</h3>
<p>Not yet! But that’s a scenario we’re prepared for as well. While I have
not been involved in a security incident, I believe it is important to
have a comprehensive incident response plan in place, including clear communication
protocols and a well-defined chain of command. During a security incident,
clarity of process and responsibilities will ensure a prompt and effective
response. At the product level, there should be a schedule in place for
regular testing and updating of security measures. This is important given
the pace at which malicious actors update their tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) in today’s context. Hence, timely updates and patching
are crucial to ensure they are effective against the latest threats.</p>
<h3>What would you say is the weakest link in cybersecurity and how is GovTech addressing this?</h3>
<p>Well, to be honest, I believe that the weakest link in cybersecurity is
often humans. This can happen via errors such as system misconfigurations
or falling for phishing scams. To combat this, GovTech heavily audits software
products developed in-house to ensure that there are proper procedures
in place for anything that is not already an automatic process.</p>
<p>Additionally, GovTech prioritises education and training for its employees
to ensure they are aware of the latest security threats and best practices.
Simulated phishing campaigns are also conducted to ensure that public officers
are alert and know how to respond in the case of an attack.</p>
<h3>Do you have any special considerations for protecting the data of vulnerable populations?</h3>
<p>I’ve got something interesting to share – typically, we think of vulnerable
populations as the elderly and the young. However, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/more-than-half-of-scam-victims-are-still-young-adults-most-fell-for-job-scams" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recent report</a>&nbsp;highlighted
that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/anyone-can-become-a-scam-victim" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">young adults</a>&nbsp;are
equally, if not more susceptible to scams where their sensitive personal
data is compromised. Hence, I believe that any measures protecting personal
data should be encompassing and not specific to any particular segment
of the population.</p>
<h3>How much of the responsibility for cybersecurity would you say lies with the end user, and what steps can citizens take to better protect their own data when interacting with government services?</h3>
<p>We’ve put measures across multiple levels to protect citizen data. However,
given that the individual ultimately owns their personal data, end users
need to play their part in protecting their own data as well. Citizens
can take steps to better protect their data by using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/why-passphases-are-much-more-secure-than-passwords" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">strong passwords or pass phrases</a>,
enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious when clicking on
links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</p>
<p>In addition, it pays to possess a healthy dose of scepticism in the digital
world.</p>
