<h3>The VigilantGantry contactless system can effectively reduce the manpower needed at temperature screening stations.</h3>

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic worsens around the world, Singapore is shoring
up its efforts to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. Businesses,
for example, are advised to adopt precautionary measures like temperature
screening to help detect the disease and to facilitate contact tracing
efforts.</p>
<p>Besides setting up stations for temperature screenings, businesses also
require staff members to operate the equipment. While areas with lower
footfall can tap on solutions like GovTech’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/how-gt-developed-fit-for-purpose-temperature-scanners-part-1" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">self-service temperature scanner</a>,
areas with high human traffic need a different approach to cope with the
high volume.</p>
<p>To speed up temperature screening in crowded areas and reduce the number
of human operators required, a team from GovTech’s Data Science and Artificial
Intelligence Division (DSAID) has developed VigilantGantry, a fully automated,
contactless gantry system for temperature screening.</p>
<p>In this second instalment of a three-part series that follows GovTech’s
in-house projects to improve temperature screening processes, TechNews
spoke with the DSAID team to find out why VigilantGantry is vital in this
time of crisis.</p>

<h3>Safe, speedy screening</h3>
<p>“The main goal of VigilantGantry is to help automate temperature screening
and manage the flow of movement into buildings in a contactless manner,”
said Ms Rachel Shong, a video analytics manager from DSAID.</p>
<p>VigilantGantry works like the gates to an MRT station to ensure minimal
physical contact. Instead of swiping your card to enter, a machine screens
your temperature and takes your picture before letting you through. GovTech
has developed VigilantGantry, a video analytics model to identify cases
missed out by current thermal systems (such as fringe, cap, headgear, and
occlusion) using face and neck segmentation and colour segmentation algorithms.
An alert will sound once the system detects an abnormal temperature, and
entry will be denied, allowing for further checks on the visitor.</p>
<p>Compare this to the existing thermal systems that deploy at least two
or three people per station, and it’s evident why VigilantGantry can create
a significant reduction in the human resources deployed at public spaces,
especially during a pandemic.</p>
<p>“VigilantGantry was designed for sites experiencing a medium to high volume
of human traffic,” said Mr Corey Chong, a manager at GovTech who is also
part of the DSAID team. While solutions like the self-service temperature
scanner, which uses a regular infrared thermometer, might work in non-crowded
areas, Mr Chong observed that they are not feasible in places that see
large crowds.</p>
<h3>Taking people out of the picture</h3>
<p>When development for VigilantGantry first began, the team visited several
sites where temperature screening was deployed to understand the users’
needs. Most premises, they realised, were already equipped with thermal
sensors. “The goal was to find a way to improve the existing situation
with minimal disruption and make it more efficient,” said Mr Bill Cai,
an associate computational scientist at GovTech.</p>
<p>Currently, most places that use thermal sensors still require personnel
to be present in case a problem arises. For instance, visitors with headgear
may need to be directed to take it off since it could potentially hinder
accurate temperature screening.</p>
<p>A truly contactless system that eliminates the need for human supervision
must, therefore, have the ability to perform checks and intervene in case
of a red flag. “Our key feature—the gantry—controls access using contactless
checks that we’ve designed to complement temperature screening,” explained
Ms Jean Ho, another video analytics manager on the team.</p>
<h3>Flexing VigilantGantry’s capabilities</h3>
<p>Along the way, the team faced many site-specific challenges, like making
sure that the software could integrate with different thermal sensor models,
space constraints and site regulations. “The challenge was making our solution
flexible, which meant doing a lot of iterative changes so that we meet
the stakeholders’ needs,” said Mr Delon Leonard, an AI engineer at GovTech.</p>
<p>To achieve flexibility, the DSAID team aimed to make every component in
VigilantGantry modular so it could be programmed with additional functionality.
For example, besides measuring body temperature and performing facial indexing,
the system can also capture the location, date and time to support contact
tracing purposes. It is also possible to store health and travel declaration
data obtained via questionnaires.</p>
<p>VigilantGantry’s flexibility means that it can be scaled up easily, Mr
Leonard added. For example, it can be integrated into existing thermal
systems without the need to purchase new equipment, a bonus in these uncertain
times when demands for thermal sensors are on the rise.</p>
<p>Currently, there are plans for VigilantGantry to be deployed at hospitals
and schools to facilitate higher human traffic at temperature screening
stations. But even as the team concludes their trials to commence first
deployments, they are continuing to improve the system.</p>
<p>At the moment, the team is looking to increase the speed of temperature
measurement using thermal imagery. They also intend to build a feedback
system to help instruct visitors, for example, to remove headgear so that
manpower needs can be further reduced. The team said that the design thinking
behind VigilantGantry was to leave no stone unturned. “Hence, the name
Vigilant,” concluded Mr Leonard.</p>
