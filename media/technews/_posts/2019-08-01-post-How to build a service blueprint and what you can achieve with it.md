<p>A service blueprint is a systematic methodology for improving service
building and delivery. Mr Lim Eyung, director at GovTech, shared his insights
on service blueprinting at the Public Service Transformation Conference
2019.</p>
<p>Going to the movies may seem straightforward, but it involves multiple
transactions between a moviegoer and the cinema. From the moment you decide
on which show to watch to the time you purchase your popcorn and are comfortably
seated in the theatre, you will have interacted at least five times with
the service provider.</p>
<p>If everything proceeded without a hitch, then the cinema has done a pretty
good job in mapping out its service journey with its customers. Ideally,
every interaction between citizens and the government should be just as
hassle-free, and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech)
hopes to realise that ideal by formulating its own service journey model.</p>
<p>But how does a government agency begin to piece together such a model?
This was the key question that Mr Lim Eyung, director at GovTech, sought
to answer at the ‚ÄòService Blueprinting and OpsTech‚Äô presentation during
the Public Service Transformation Conference held at Our Tampines Hub on
18 July 2019.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn a nutshell, we want to have a better version of the journey mapping
tool that allows us to talk about what is the user experience? What are
the actions [on the part of citizens and service providers]?‚Äù said Lim.</p>

<h4>Ask, watch and learn</h4>
<p>The first step of a service journey model involves painting an accurate
picture of the current state of affairs. This takes some introspection.
How does an agency work? What is easy for citizens to accomplish? What
is hard?</p>
<p>Returning to the cinema analogy, Mr Lim described how a local cinema might
first interview a lot of its patrons to understand their likes and dislikes
as they go about the ticketing process. The next part is less obvious but
absolutely essential: interview employees. Suppose the owner decides robots
will improve efficiency, but by interviewing employees and then discovering
the system cannot handle the scaling. In that case, the owner either needs
to think of a different solution or consider upgrading the backend.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to simply observe the process, said Mr Lim. In
an interview, people may say things that do not accurately reflect their
actual experience. They may gloss over major problems or exaggerate issues;
hence, observation of behaviour helps service providers find out how complicated
humans interface with a service.</p>
<p>Once a company has obtained an accurate perspective of the current system,
it can then move on to build a service blueprint for the future.</p>
<h4>Sometimes, less is more</h4>
<p>A service blueprint is an outline to help people analyse pain points and
figure out how to solve problems, consolidate processes or eliminate redundancies.</p>
<p>During the service blueprinting process, a small but helpful piece of
advice Mr Lim gave is to have a ‚Äúcommissioning meeting‚Äù. This is a session
where everyone in the team gathers, and specific jobs are commissioned
to individuals. It helps the team understand their roles and the parts
played by their colleagues. It also streamlines internal communications
and clarifies job scopes. Thereafter, the team can then take a range of
actions to improve the service journey.</p>
<p>For example, an organisation could combine or remove stages in the service
journey. In the context of a cinema, moviegoers could purchase their tickets
and snacks simultaneously via an online channel. Subsequently, when they
arrive at the cinema, they need only display a QR code to pick up their
food items and proceed into the theatre, validating their QR code as they
go. This also would eliminate the printing of physical tickets, saving
business costs on paper and helping the company ‚Äúgo green‚Äù, Mr Lim explained.</p>

<h4>A gentle nudge goes a long way</h4>
<p>In addition to consolidating processes, Mr Lim noted that nudging may
be a desirable feature at some point in the service journey. A big mistake
an agency can make is assuming that its customers are all proactive individuals.
People these days lead busy lives, and while they may have intended to
complete a transaction, they could become distracted and fail to follow
through.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFrom a business point of view, we want to make a call to action. We want
people to sign up, to do something by a certain time or date, or to remind
them before they get fined,‚Äù said Mr Lim.</p>
<p>Again referencing the moviegoing experience, he said that a cinema may
send reminders to their customers a few hours before the movie starts.
They can even offer deals on food or send customers an alert if better
seats become available. Guiding customers along a service journey is an
important step towards improving customer satisfaction, Mr Lim advised.</p>
<h4>Precautions and product personality</h4>
<p>From a service provider‚Äôs standpoint, one mistake to avoid is having employees
go through an entire service journey model without testing a minimum viable
product, said Mr Lim.</p>

</div>
<p>If the cinema owner wants to launch an app, for instance, a severe error
would be to check in on the implementation of the service journey model
three months later when the app is set to go live. Such a mentality increases
the chance that a small error will crash the entire system or that the
app design can‚Äôt be scaled. Instead, Mr Lim advised frequent reviews of
service journey milestones as the app is being developed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAn additional consideration is the product personality,‚Äù he added, referring
to the tone of engagement, which includes things like the choice of language
and imagery associated with the app or digital product. Having a consistent
product personality eases user navigation and could create a positive perception
of the product owner.</p>
<p>The service journey model thus pushes an organisation to put its customers
first and streamline their experience. Internally, it helps the organisation
actively become more efficient using an organised and systematic framework,
Mr Lim concluded.</p>
