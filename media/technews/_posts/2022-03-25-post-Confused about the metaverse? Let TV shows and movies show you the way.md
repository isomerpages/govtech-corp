<p>Heard of the metaverse? Of course you have. Unless you‚Äôve been living
under a rock, it‚Äôs hard not to have at least come across the term since
Facebook decided to change its name to Meta.</p>
<p>The social media giant said this was to reflect its next focus ‚Äì to develop
a fully immersive virtual world as well as holograms that blend seamlessly
into the physical world, a pursuit it‚Äôs calling the metaverse.</p>
<p>Going by that alone, you‚Äôre bound to be left with more questions than
answers, the first of which is: Just what is the metaverse? Turns out,
the fictional world of TV shows and movies can point the way towards some
understanding of the concept. But before we get into that, let‚Äôs start
with the origin of the word.</p>

<h3>More a notion than a definition</h3>
<p>Of course, Facebook (or we say Meta) is not the first to use the term.
The 1992 book&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash#Metaverse" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Snow Crash</a>&nbsp;coined
the word, combining the prefix ‚Äúmeta‚Äù ‚Äì which means ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù in Ancient
Greek ‚Äì and ‚Äúverse‚Äù ‚Äì short for ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù ‚Äì to refer to an amalgamation
of the virtual and physical world.</p>
<p>Almost three decades on, the metaverse is more a notion than a definition,
simply because it doesn‚Äôt really exist‚Ä¶ yet. This lack of a clear meaning
opens up a world of possibilities to shape the contours of the metaverse.</p>
<p>In Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>&nbsp;after
his company‚Äôs announcement, he outlined a future where ‚Äúyou will be able
to teleport instantly as a hologram to be at the office without a commute‚Äù
and ‚Äúyour perfect work setup with multiple monitors ‚Äì instead of physical
things assembled in factories, they‚Äôll be holograms designed by creators
around the world‚Äù.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs not just tech companies that want a piece of the metaverse.&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.dbs.com.sg/treasures/templatedata/article/generic/data/en/CIO/112021/211115CIOVP.xml#" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Banks</a>, for instance, are studying the concept because of the potential
of a completely virtual, parallel economy surfacing.</p>
<p>Since the metaverse is envisioned as a realm in which to live and play,
the entertainment industry has been getting in on the act as well. The
popular game Roblox, whose 43 million daily active users give it a claim
as a metaverse, held a&nbsp;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/20/roblox-unveils-electronic-music-festival-in-the-metaverse/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">three-day electronic music festival</a>,
while singer Justin Bieber appeared as an avatar at his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bandwagon.asia/articles/justin-bieber-metaverse-concert-justin-bieber-an-interactive-virtual-experience-free-tickets-sign-up" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">virtual concert.</a>
</p>
<p>Still, these efforts to realise a seamless blending of the virtual and
physical world are still very much just baby steps. For fuller depictions
of what the metaverse could look like, we would have to turn to the world
of fiction, which is fitting as the term (as you would recall) came from
a sci-fi novel.</p>
<h3>Reel life to real life?</h3>
<p>Remember the 2008 animated movie Wall-E, which showed a distant future
where humans were glued to their screens even while eating and moving about?
Well, it took less than a decade for that to become reality today!</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs take a look at what fiction might tell us about the metaverse
of the future.</p>
<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>In the 2011 novel and the 2018 film adaptation, people enter a fully immersive
virtual environment called the OASIS to escape the drudgery of their lives.
But there are real stakes involved as a series of three challenges exists
within the virtual universe. The grand prize? Ownership of the OASIS itself.</p>
<p>Of course, this draws not just individual fortune seekers, but also corporate
interest in the form of a company that employs an army of participants
under exploitative conditions in a bid to win the contest.</p>
<h3>Black Mirror</h3>
<p>If you already have mild technophobia, you‚Äôll probably want to stay away
from this television series that depicts the bleak consequences of tech‚Äôs
growing impact on our lives. The show has several interpretations of what
the metaverse might look like. One comes in the form of being able to duplicate
your entire consciousness digitally, akin to cloning just your mind and
sense of self.</p>
<p>The implications are explored in different episodes. Some people use a
copy of their minds to run their smart home system (who else knows better
than yourself exactly how your morning coffee should be made?). Problem
is, that copy is a conscious mind now experiencing life trapped as Siri
or Alexa for eternity.</p>
<p>Another episode features a tech worker who surreptitiously copies the
consciousness of his co-workers so he can torture them within the confines
of a video game he designed.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not all about the dark side, though, as yet another episode offers
a hopeful vision of having your consciousness uploaded into a digital paradise
when you die, bringing another meaning to ‚ÄúHeaven is a place on Earth‚Äù.</p>
<h3>Westworld</h3>
<p>In Westworld, the metaverse is much more physical than virtual, with giant
theme parks populated by life-like robots and human players who are there
to experience life in the Wild West, colonial-era India, or feudal Japan,
whatever catches their fancy.</p>
<p>So if androids do reach the point where they can pass off as humans, then
perhaps the sandboxes will be based in the real world instead of online.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>This hit franchise from the late 1990s/early 2000s just got a new instalment
recently, so you can check out another interpretation of the metaverse
being where people spend the bulk ‚Äì nah, make the entirety ‚Äì of their lives
plugged in digitally.</p>
<p>But the twist here is that it‚Äôs an involuntary imprisonment, with humans
harnessed as batteries from the moment they are born. To keep their minds
docile, they are hooked up to the Matrix, a massive simulation of life.</p>
<h3>Scratching the surface</h3>
<p>Which depiction of the metaverse will ultimately prove to be true? When
will the future arrive? Your guess is as good as ours at this point. What
we do know is that certain massive multiplayer games where players are
free to build the environment as they go along are the closest to a metaverse
but by no means close enough to what fiction has portrayed. Will we ever
get there? Only time will tell.</p>
