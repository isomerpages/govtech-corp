<p>In 2024, running a business can be challenging. Especially if you’re a
small business in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sbf.org.sg/docs/default-source/advocacy-policy/sbf-research-reports/nbs-2023-2024---final-report-(final-version).pdf?sfvrsn=8c6eb618_1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>National Business Survey 2023/2024 </u></a>by
the Singapore Business Federation revealed that rising costs and resource
limitations are top challenges for businesses, especially SMEs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While a large part of a business’ success ultimately depends on a huge
range of factors – think product quality, customer service, marketing effectiveness,
and operational efficiency, and of course, leadership – we try to help
out where we can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are three essential (and free!) tools GovTech created that can help
businesses streamline operations, saving time and yes as the saying goes
– money.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Business Grants Portal</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GoBusiness</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TradeTrust</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Get the help you need via the Business Grants Portal</h3>
<p>For a small business owner, there can be a dizzying amount of grants which
can become information overload, which then in turn, translates into inaction.
Well, that’s where the&nbsp; <a href="https://www.businessgrants.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Business Grants Portal</u></a> comes
in.</p>
<p>This is a resource that brings together government grants for businesses,
making it easier to find and apply for grants. This portal streamlines
the application process and helps businesses manage and accept grants more
efficiently. By leveraging the Business Grants Portal, businesses can explore
grants that alleviate financial stress and enable them to maximise profits.</p>
<p><strong>Some useful grants to consider:</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<h3>Take B2B to the next level with TradeTrust</h3>
<p><a href="/products-and-services/for-businesses/trade-transactions/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TradeTrust</a> is
a framework designed to enhance the trustworthiness of electronic trade
documents. It integrates globally recognised standards with public blockchain
technology, enabling seamless interoperability across digital platforms
for governments and businesses.</p>
<p>In simple terms: It's kind of like a digital envelope for businesses,
helping them to make their trade documents verifiable (Verifiable Documents)
and/or transferable (Electronic Transferable Records - ETR)easily and securely.
At the same time, the documents are portable and effective across digital
systems.</p>
<p>Using TradeTrust, business owners can enhance the trustworthiness of the
documents that they issue, reducing the risk of someone faking their documents
because the issuer and integrity of the documents are cryptographically
protected. Similarly, business owners who receive TradeTrust-protected
documents from their business partners can be assured that the received
documents are not fake and have not been tampered with.</p>
<p>These remove the need for repetitive checks by the various trade ecosystem
parties to verify whether the documents/information received are legitimate.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Why use TradeTrust?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TradeTrust ensures your digital documents are legally recognised across
countries, saving you potential legal hassles and costs.</p>

<li>
<p>By using globally accepted standards, TradeTrust streamlines your operations,
reducing the need for expensive custom solutions and making it easier to
work with partners worldwide.</p>

<p>TradeTrust follows international rules, helping you avoid costly compliance
issues and ensuring your technology meets legal requirements without expensive
modifications.</p>

(DLT), TradeTrust offers cost-effective integration options, allowing you
to connect seamlessly with other systems and streamline your processes
without breaking the bank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Embrace tech to boost productivity</h3>
<p>While these tools are not a silver bullet, they can be valuable resources
for businesses looking to cut costs and boost profits. By leveraging these
tools effectively, businesses can improve their competitiveness and overcome
the challenges they face locally – and with enough luck, perhaps internationally
as well!</p>
