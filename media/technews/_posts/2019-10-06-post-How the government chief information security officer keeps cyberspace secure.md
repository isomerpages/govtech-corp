<p>The Singapore government is crafting policy, tapping on technology and
engaging with the community to strengthen the defence of government IT
assets and citizen data, says Mr Chai Chin Loon, government chief information
security officer.</p>
<p>If you had all the resources in the world, how would you protect your
home against an intruder? You might put up CCTV cameras, install motion
sensors along the walkways leading to your apartment, use multiple locks
on the gates, employ a guard to patrol the surrounding premises—and, for
extra measure, keep a guard dog. Even then, determined and intelligent
thieves could find their way in and leave with your precious personal items.</p>
<p>Such a scenario has its parallels in the digital realm. No matter how
robust one’s cyber defences are, a chink in the metaphorical ‘armour’ can
always be found and exploited, given enough time. What this means is that
cybersecurity systems deployed by individuals and organisations need to
be dynamic—constantly evolving with emerging technologies and threats.</p>
<p>Mr Chai Chin Loon, government chief information security officer and senior
director at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), knows
this all too well. On the frontlines of the cybersecurity arms race, his
daily challenge is to keep government digital assets and citizen data safe
from malicious actors.</p>
<p>“From the government’s perspective, we have to cover the whole spectrum
of cyber defence, from protecting against lone-wolf hackers all the way
up to highly sophisticated and well-resourced state actors,” he said.</p>
<h3>A lesson in trade-offs</h3>
<p>When it comes to cybersecurity, “throwing” all security controls the problem
won’t work, in Mr Chai’s opinion. Instead, he advocates a balance among
three key parameters: security, costs and functionalities.</p>
<p>“Historically, cybersecurity has been focused on protection. The higher
the ‘walls’ you put in place, the more layers you have, the more secure
you are. But security has a cost,” he emphasised, referring not only to
the financial cost of implementing cybersecurity measures but also to the
cost in terms of missed opportunities to provide greater value to users.</p>
<p>“If we keep increasing the security we put around the three groups of
our core users—our citizens, our businesses and our public servants—it
will affect their productivity and their ease-of-use,” he said. “So we
have to find the right balance to achieve security without overly inconveniencing
users to the point they stop using the services that are provided to them,
and end up finding alternative that may be non-sanctioned ways of doing
things.”</p>
<p>What’s needed, then, is a calibrated framework whereby protections in
cyberspace are pegged to the level of sensitivity of activities being carried
out or data being accessed. One useful way to do this is to segregate information
into different tiers—for example, ‘secret’, ‘confidential’, ‘restricted’
and ‘unclassified’. Each tier will then be subjected to different levels
of access restrictions, activity logging and so on. This approach advocates
a risk-based security approach, said Mr Chai, and will help organisations
better prioritise their cybersecurity efforts.</p>
<h3>Giving guidance</h3>
<p>Often, the deployment of a calibrated cybersecurity framework requires
leadership at the level of policy setting. But where do policymakers take
reference from to craft such frameworks?</p>
<p>Mr Chai highlighted that the Singapore government references relevant
international cybersecurity standards and best practices such as those
published by the US’ National Institute of Standards and Technology and
the European Telecommunications Standards Institute’s Cybersecurity Technical
Committee. This has resulted in the security portion of IM8 document, which
consists of government policies, standards and guidelines for IT security.</p>
<p>Yet, simply putting out a policy document is not enough, said Mr Chai.
“After crafting the policy, we need to help the system implementers understand
how to comply with it because otherwise, there may be different interpretations
of the policy,” he noted, adding that within the government, a group of
cybersecurity consultants exists to advise the various agencies on IM8
compliance matters and take on a risk-based approach to secure their system.
Regular consultations are also important because of the fast-moving frontier
of cybersecurity—policy cannot remain static and will need to be updated
frequently.</p>
