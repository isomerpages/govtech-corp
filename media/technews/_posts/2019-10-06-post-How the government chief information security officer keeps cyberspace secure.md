<p>This is the second part of an article discussing how the Singapore government
is crafting policy, using technology, and engaging with the community to
strengthen the defence of government IT assets and citizen data.</p>
<p>“Not if, but when” is a common refrain in cybersecurity circles, used
to highlight the inevitability of an organisation falling victim to a major
hacking incident. Given the increasing frequency of cyberattacks, government
chief information security officer Mr Chai Chin Loon highlighted that technological
solutions are needed to better deter, detect, diagnose and deal with threats.</p>
<p>“For example, we have put in place automated security information event
management systems with rules to process voluminous logs to automatically
flag incidents to our cybersecurity analysts,” he said. To avoid overwhelming
the analysts, some of these systems can even decide whether a fishy online
activity constitutes a valid threat.</p>
<p>“If the system detects suspicious traffic at one layer of our defences
but that traffic gets dropped at the next defence layer, then the threat
did not compromise anything, so we should be able to automatically close
the case and not trigger more human action,” Mr Chai explained.</p>
<p>Having said that, such systems are currently configured to err on the
side of caution and still involve cybersecurity analysts to review. The
government is always on the alert to reduce the number of false positives
without sacrificing sensitivity to real threats, he added. The greater
use of Machine Learning is one such rapidly evolving area.</p>
<h3>A walk in the enemy’s shoes</h3>
<p>While it is important to focus on defence, being able to think like a
hacker is just as critical for shoring up cybersecurity. This is the role
of the Red Team in GovTech, which adopts an adversarial mindset in trying
to bypass the government’s cybersecurity measures, said Mr Chai.</p>
<p>For example, the Red Team is emulating phishing attacks, posing as hackers
who impersonate legitimate organisations to extract private information
from unwitting individuals via emails, text messages or voice calls. This
has, in turn, pushed GovTech to develop the Jaga platform—a play on the
Malay word for ‘to guard’—for easy reporting of phishing emails.</p>
<p>GovTech has also recently released an official government URL shortener—
<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-white-hacker" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg</a>—to reduce the likelihood of phishing URLs being disseminated.
“Other URL shorteners like <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-white-hacker" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bit.ly</a> allow
anyone to mask links to dubious sites. Users can trust the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-white-hacker" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gov.sg</a> domain
name as one needs a government email to configure a URL, preventing abuses,”
Mr Chai said.</p>
<p>Collectively, these developments demonstrate how having an adversarial
mindset within the government can lead to better countermeasures against
emerging threats.</p>
<h3>Reinforcements on the ground</h3>
<p>As much as the government is doing to shore up its cybersecurity efforts,
citizens can also help to identify vulnerabilities in government IT systems.
To better engage with the community of ‘white hats’—a term that refers
to individuals who hack to expose cybersecurity risks—GovTech has rolled
out two initiatives:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-white-hacker" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the Government Bug Bounty Programme</a>&nbsp;and
the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/report_vulnerability" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP)</a>.</p>
<p>The former awards monetary prizes for reporting on vulnerabilities for
systems under test during the BBP period. The latter is open all year round,
and individuals are recognised with reputation points and non-monetary
tokens, such as our own version of Arduino called C01N. VDP reporting can
be done through the link at the bottom of government web pages.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>“Software and IT systems are all set up by humans, and humans make mistakes.
The key thing is whether we can catch those mistakes faster than the baddies?
And if we can find them through responsible reporting means and not after
they have been exploited, then we’re better off,” said Mr Chai.</p>
<p>As a token of appreciation to those who report vulnerabilities via the
VDP, a programmable medal will be awarded to them. “These limited-edition
medals have built in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which not only allow us to recognise
people for their efforts, but also complements the hacking instinct of
such individuals,” Mr Chai quipped.</p>
<p>Hence, with sound policy, strong technical expertise, an adversarial mindset
within government, and active involvement in the white hat community, Mr
Chai is optimistic that the delicate balance of cybersecurity, cost, and
functionality will be achievable.</p>
