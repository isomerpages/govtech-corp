<p>In late 2016, GovTech set up <a href="/our-communities/join-our-communities/tech-kaki/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Tech Kaki</u></a>,
a citizen community,‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äãto encourage participation and collect user feedback
in the development of government digital products and services (think LifeSG,
Singpass, MyLegacy, etc). &nbsp; Since its inception, Tech Kaki members
have given us insights to uncover usability issues or user experience challenges
that aren‚Äôt always apparent to us. It also gives us the opportunity to
validate some assumptions around specific user behaviours. Furthermore,
by co-creating ‚Äãalongside our product teams and across the government in
surveys, focus group discussions and user testing sessions, Tech Kaki plays
an important role in fine-tuning our products to ensure they meet the needs
of citizens and businesses, making their participation even more valuable.</p>
<p>Over the years, Tech Kaki has grown into a dedicated community of over
6,000 members from all walks of life. We spoke to one of Tech Kaki‚Äôs digital
advocates, 62-year-old Jee Su Giam, to find out:</p>

<li>
<p>What he enjoys about being in the community</p>

<h3>What initially inspired you to join Tech Kaki?</h3>
<p>The first time I knew about Tech Kaki was when I participated in <a href="/products-and-services/for-citizens/crowdsourcing/crowdtasksg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>CrowdTaskSG surveys</u></a>;
it got me thinking about how I could play a larger role as a citizen contributor.</p>
<p>Later in December 2022, I was asked by a team from GovTech to help with
usability ‚Äã‚Äãtesting for <a href="https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>SupportGoWhere</u></a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the usability test was to gauge my first-hand experience
with an upcoming feature intended to help citizens understand their eligible
financial benefits. During the one-hour session, we delved into a discussion
about their website prototype and I provided feedback on both the website‚Äôs
usability and the usefulness of the feature.</p>
<p>The experience, along with seeing GovTech‚Äôs approach to developing technology
from an ‚Äòoutside-in‚Äô perspective, spurred me to finally become a part of
Tech Kaki in March 2023.</p>
<h3>What makes you want to contribute to the community?</h3>
<p>Joining the Tech Kaki community gives me a chance to share my interest
in technology and ensures it meets the needs of end-users, especially seniors
like me.</p>
<p>At the same time, I enjoy keeping up with the latest technology and app
developments too! Recently, my volunteer work with the Smart Nation Builder
in June 2023 allowed me to interact directly with the public and encourage
seniors to provide feedback on apps like LifeSG and explore the use of
AI for detecting early dementia via <a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives/project-pensieve/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Project Pensieve</u></a>.</p>
<h3>What do you enjoy most about being part of the Tech Kaki community?</h3>
<p>As a community member of Tech Kaki, I‚Äôve enjoyed working together with
the product and research teams to improve apps from a user‚Äôs perspective
and make them more user-friendly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joining the Tech Kaki community also offers many benefits, like being
able to share your skills and interests in co-creating technology for the
public good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also a good opportunity to work on projects that make our society
more inclusive, and I feel great that I can empower people through technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a real impact with your contributions and help seniors become
more comfortable with digital technology, improving digital literacy across
society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through Tech Kaki, I‚Äôve participated in various research and surveys,
such as the Government Website Usability Survey and studies on the National
Library Board Mobile App, LifeSG, and other government digital services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has significantly improved my understanding of technology and how
it can be applied to benefit Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Have you encountered any challenges while working on projects, and how did you overcome them?</h3>
<p>In 2020, I helped start the ‚ÄúSenior Go Digital‚Äù program, where we faced
challenges in teaching seniors to use new technology via digital ambassadors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea was to provide one-to-one guidance on how to use social media,
such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, Zoom sessions, etc., as well as make
e-payments via their smartphones, e.g., EPLJ (E-Payment Learning Journey).</p>
<p>Outside of the expected challenges of vision and hearing, I also noticed
a significant language barrier! The majority of our presentation slides,
pamphlets and posters were in English; most of the seniors were more familiar
with Mandarin.</p>
<p>To overcome this, I took the initiative to translate these materials into
Mandarin so that the seniors could better understand them.</p>
<p>Before the usability test for SupportGoWhere, my prior knowledge of Government
Technology (GT) was quite limited. However, this experience ignited a keen
interest in understanding how I could actively contribute to shaping Singapore‚Äôs
digital landscape; thus, I joined Tech Kaki.</p>
<p>As a grassroots leader, my primary concern has always been the welfare
of the residents I serve. I believe in the importance of ensuring their
representation in the development of digital products so that no one within
the community is left behind. This sense of responsibility and purpose
is what drives me to continue contributing. Whether it‚Äôs making a significant
impact or simply playing a small part, the knowledge that I am making a
positive difference is my most fulfilling reward. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>What are some of your hobbies outside of Tech Kaki?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>I am involved in various volunteering and community activities, including
being a GRL (Grassroots Leader) in the Ulu Pandan Division and a member
of the NParks, Nature Kakis community, participating in tree planting and
therapeutic horticulture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My hobbies include playing badminton and volleyball, brisk walking, and
reading a wide range of books from engineering to history and science.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also enjoy collecting DVDs, stamps, coins, MRT and telephone cards,
miniature toys, and other memorabilia.&nbsp;</p>
