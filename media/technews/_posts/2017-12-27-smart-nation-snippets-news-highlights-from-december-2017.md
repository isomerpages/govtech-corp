*In this monthly series, TechNews seeks out the most important and interesting Smart Nation stories to bring to you, the reader. This December, learn about how digital technologies will impact everyday activities like commerce and commuting, as well as change the way we interact with physical space.*

Digitalisation and disruption were the buzzwords of December. As the majority of our daily activities and interactions migrate online, governments need to think deeply about the risks and opportunities of this digital revolution. Singapore has made significant advances in digitalising many of its government services, and the island nation’s push to become a Smart Nation caught the eyes of the Holland Innovation Network recently. 

Meanwhile, as digital space expands, how can shared physical spaces evolve in tandem? And while bike sharing looks set to disrupt urban mobility, what are some of the challenges that remain? Get up to date with these developments with this month’s Smart Nation Snippets.

High-speed wireless connectivity, sensor networks, electronic payment systems and trade platforms are some of the ‘bricks’ that make a Smart Nation. At the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, held in Singapore from 6-10 November 2017, a panel of experts touched on how these digital technologies will affect commerce and commuting.

In an interview with Channel NewsAsia, Minister-in-Charge of the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) Dr Janil Puthucheary, noted that Singapore has made good headway in its Smart Nation ambitions. He highlighted the MyInfo platform and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore’s (ICA) application for passport online electronic (APPLES) system as examples of how digitalisation is making Singaporeans’ lives more convenient.

The Holland Innovation Network at the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Singapore has put together a wide-ranging review of Singapore’s Smart Nation motivations and initiatives.

Advances in the digital realm can spill over into the physical world, according to this article in The Conversation. With sensor platforms that monitor physical spaces, city planners can leverage urban data to develop better infrastructure. Digital technologies such as augmented reality can also change the way people experience physical spaces, helping to preserve and promote the historical narrative associated with a location.

Mobility-as-a-service is an emerging concept in the domain of transportation, and dockless bike sharing has become widely popular within a relatively short span of time. Despite the usefulness of such services, concerns over data collection and privacy have been raised, not to mention the ‘visual clutter’ of bicycles parked haphazardly in public spaces. Some guidelines and regulations for service providers may be in order.
