<h3>Students from post-secondary institutions put their heads together to devise digital solutions for a smart nation at the inaugural ‘Build On, Singapore 2019’ hackathon.</h3>
<p>Transforming Singapore into a smart nation is no easy feat—it takes both
technology and talent, and both were on display at the inaugural ‘Build
On, Singapore 2019’ hackathon.</p>
<p>Jointly organised by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech),
Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the National University of Singapore (NUS),
the event saw teams of students from Institutes of Technical Education
(ITE), junior colleges (JC), polytechnics and universities devising solutions
for a range of urban challenges over a span of three weeks.</p>
<p>The hackathon culminated in a final round of judging at the Suntec Singapore
Convention and Exhibition Centre on 24 September 2019. Representatives
from the organising parties, as well as supporting partners Singtel, Intel
and Singapore Press Holdings, were on-site to assess the quality of submissions
by the student teams.</p>
<h3>Rising up to the challenge</h3>
<p>Of the 51 entries, only nine made it to the final presentations. Among
them was a mobile application called NoSqueeze, which integrates bus schedules
and crowd data to help students create custom timetables for travelling
around campus.</p>
<p>Another promising idea was a virtual voice assistant aimed at helping
the elderly perform a range of tasks, from filling up online forms to ordering
food via digital platforms.</p>
<p>The virtual voice assistant, named Jamie 2.0—pays homage to GovTech’s
own government chatbot, Ask Jamie, and taps on GovTech’s National Digital
Identity (NDI) system. It can also interface with other government digital
services and third-party applications.</p>
<p>Mr Jason Chow, an undergraduate from the Singapore University of Technology
and Design who was part of the team that developed Jamie 2.0, said, “Singapore
has a rapidly ageing population, so my team was focused on how smart nation
technologies can better serve this growing demographic.”</p>
<p>He added that Jamie 2.0 could also help overcome some of the friction
that the elderly encounter with biometric scanning for authentication.
Instead of a fingerprint, the elderly could use their voice as a signature
to interact with Jamie 2.0 to access government services online.</p>
<h3>A treasure trove of ideas</h3>
<p>Promising as Jamie 2.0 seemed, it was overshadowed by a parking solution
created by a team of NUS students going by the moniker ‘5 peas in a pod’.
The team won the university category of the hackathon with an integrated
mobile platform powered by machine learning, which would help drivers find
their ideal parking lot.</p>
<p>For example, users can calculate the price of parking beforehand and find
a suitable lot based on price or distance preferences while navigating
to their destinations, all in the same application.</p>
<p>“We wanted to provide drivers with an end-to-end solution for finding
a parking lot,” said the platform’s developer, Ms Rebecca Tan, an Information
Systems Technology student currently in her final year of studies at NUS.
She highlighted that most existing solutions only perform navigation or
list parking prices, but none compile all these functions in one place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the polytechnic students' team, ‘Meow’ from Singapore Polytechnic,
won the category. Their entry was a platform to gamify the job-hunting
process for young people. In the ITE and JC category, team ‘CloudByters’
emerged as winners with their online facilities-booking system proposal.
All the winners received their prizes from the guest of honour, NUS President
Professor Tan Eng Chye.</p>
<p>“Some solutions were quite impressive and well-thought-out, while others
were entirely new and refreshing,” remarked Mr Quek Yang Boon, director
of Smart Nation Systems and Solutions, Sensor and Internet of Things, at
GovTech, who was also one of the senior judges for the hackathon.</p>
<p>“I observed good alignment between the goals of businesses, the schools
and the government during this hackathon, and I think such competitions
help us build and identify talent to achieve our smart nation goals,” he
said.</p>
