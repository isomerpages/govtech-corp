<p>Since 2007, people around the world have been marking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.earthhour.org/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Earth Hour</a>&nbsp;by
turning off non-essential lights in the hope that darkened homes, billboards,
and buildings will raise awareness about the environment.</p>
<p>As this year‚Äôs Earth Hour approaches on March 23, why not take a further
step by getting you beyond the concrete jungle we live in and appreciating
what we‚Äôre trying to protect ‚Äî the beauty of nature.</p>
<p>We have four apps that will enhance your outdoor experience and boost
your knowledge about Singapore‚Äôs greenery.</p>

<h3>1. Learn about the green giants around you with TreesSG</h3>
<p>Singapore is a garden city replete with trees, shrubs, and all manners
of plants throughout its urban landscape. And while trees may look very
similar to the untrained eye, the trees of Singapore actually come from
a bewildering variety of species and have different, unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Explore the trees of Singapore by using this interactive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">map</a>&nbsp;of
the island (yes, NParks and GovTech really did map over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/the-inside-story-of-how-nparks-mapped-500000-trees-in-singapore-on-treessg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">half a million</a>&nbsp;trees).
You can click on any tree on the map to see its name, characteristics,
and the benefits it provides. Curious about the trees around your home
or in a particular area? You can use the search function to see trees in
a chosen location or to look for specific species that you are interested
in.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs more, useful symbols also mark out special trees, such as those
designated as heritage trees and those that are flowering. Users like yourself
can also play a part in enriching the website as you can upload photos
to share sightings of flowering trees and even tag notes of appreciation
to your favourite tree.</p>
<p>You can also follow the myriad of recommended&nbsp;<a href="https://beta.nparks.gov.sg/visit/activities/nature-walks-tours" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">trails</a>&nbsp;that
will let you discover local trees and biodiversity. For instance, the&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/~/media/nparks-real-content/gardens-parks-and-nature/diy-walk/diy-walk-pdf-files/civic-district-tree-trail.pdf" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Civic District tree trail</a>&nbsp;introduces you to some of the oldest
trees in Singapore while also revealing their place in the country‚Äôs history.</p>
<p>As for those with young children below the age of three, you can check
this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg/one-million-trees-movement/familytrees" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">linked page</a>&nbsp;to
look out for opportunities to commemorate your child‚Äôs birth by planting
a tree. The tree will grow along with your little one, and wouldn‚Äôt it
be cool to look back one day to see how far both of them have come?</p>
<p>Learn about the TreesSG&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/treessg" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>
<h3>2. See what lives near you with SGBioAtlas</h3>
<p>As a tropical island, Singapore is home to a treasure trove of biodiversity.
SGBioAtlas relies on crowdsourcing to map the distribution of flora and
fauna on the island.</p>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<a href="https://biome.nparks.gov.sg/Sightings/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">‚Äúsightings‚Äù</a>&nbsp;tab,
there are photos of kingfishers, snakes, butterflies, and even cockroaches
that are geotagged to different locations. In the map view, you can also
filter for the category (birds, arthropods, amphibians, etc) you want to
see.</p>
<p>And as always, you are welcome to make a submission, so if you see something
intriguing on your outdoor adventures, be sure to snap a picture, upload
it to SGBioAtlas app and enhance this biodiversity repository. And don‚Äôt
worry if you don‚Äôt know the name of the critter you saw. The cataloguing
can be done on your behalf after experts have had the time to look at your
photo contribution.</p>
<p>Learn about SGBioAtlas&nbsp;<a href="https://biome.nparks.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Bring nature nearer with NParks Explore A Route</h3>
<p>The NParks Explore A Route, or NEAR app, is another map platform. This
one is, however, dedicated to park connectors and trails all over the island.</p>
<p>Following the routes on the app will give you an interactive curated walking
experience. For example, the 36 km Coast to Coast trail features augmented
reality checkpoints where AR animals spring to live and share about the
local flora and fauna.</p>
<p>You can also be part of an active hiking community that creates its own
trails, sharing them through the self-mapping feature ‚ÄúPhyll My Trail‚Äù.
It even allows you to mark out gorgeous sights and interesting information
that you spot along the way.</p>
<p>If you can‚Äôt access the app, you can still access information on the park
connector networks and trails on NParks‚Äô&nbsp;<a href="https://pcn.nparks.gov.sg/aboutrecreationalconnectivity/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website.</a>
</p>
<h3>4. Be prepared for the weather with myENV</h3>
<p>Going out to experience nature means leaving the comfort of the indoors
‚Äì and facing the elements. Whether you‚Äôre walking along the Rail Corridor,
hiking up Bukit Timah Hill, or just picnicking at Coney Island, myEnv will
be a useful companion to download on your phone!</p>
<p>Most people know myENV for providing accurate and up-to-date data on the
weather, but of course, it‚Äôs more than that. The app also gives you information
about dengue hot spots, air quality, water levels, floods, food hygiene,
and where to recycle your waste.</p>
<p>Download myEnv&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives/urban-living/myenv-app/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>
<h3>Embrace the great outdoors</h3>
<p>Yes, there is a certain irony in using tech to encourage us to embrace
the great outdoors. But hey, who said tech is just about staying in air-con
rooms and mindlessly looking at our devices?</p>
<p>Ultimately, tech is simply a tool that we can apply to different situations
and goals. And it‚Äôs definitely a worthy goal to get close to nature.</p>
<p>After all, Earth Hour is just a symbolic gesture to raise awareness about
the enormous task of sustainability. It‚Äôs up to us to appreciate the environmental
richness we have on our sunny island and pass it on to the next generation.</p>
<p>We can‚Äôt think of a better starting point for having a love for nature.</p>
