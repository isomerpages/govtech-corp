<p></p>
<p>In a world that is increasingly digital, leaving anyone behind is not
an option. This is particularly true in Singapore, where we have a rapidly
ageing population. In 2023, nearly one-fifth of Singapore‚Äôs population
was elderly.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs not just about age ‚Äî vulnerable communities of all kinds need
to be considered as technology becomes more deeply ingrained in daily life.
That‚Äôs why at GovTech, we believe that digital services are for everyone.
This is why by 2030, we‚Äôre aiming to ensure that all high-traffic government
websites are accessible to persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>As of 2023, we‚Äôre at 73% ‚Äî up 10% from the previous year.</p>
<p>But beyond the stats, there‚Äôs a certain method to how we approach things.
Singapore‚Äôs strategy rests on three pillars. Let‚Äôs start with the first‚Ä¶</p>
<h3>An Accretive and Agile Approach</h3>
<p>Due to the dynamic nature of digital development, we adopt an accretive
and agile approach when it comes to the development of our digital products.
This means prioritising continuous improvement to meet the changing needs
of all users in hopes of preventing a digital divide.</p>
<p>One such example is the Singpass app ‚Äî since its launch in 2018, the app
has undergone numerous enhancements to make it more user-friendly for everyone.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2020, we introduced the <a href="/media/media-releases/2020-12-16-singpass-2fa/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Multi-User SMS 2FA</u></a>,
allowing users who require assistance to transact online securely. Then,
we further expanded the app‚Äôs <a href="/media/technews/how-singpass-learnt-three-languages/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>language support in 2022</u></a> to
include more Mother Tongues, making it accessible to a wider audience.
In addition, accessibility features like dark mode and screen-reader support
were added to make app navigation seamless for visually impaired users.</p>
<h3>Investing in our people and their skills</h3>
<p>For an inclusive Singapore, we need to empower every citizen with digital
skills. That‚Äôs what we believe anyway.</p>
<p>Through programs like <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/digitalforlife/digital-skills-for-life" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Digital Skills for Life</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/seniors-go-digital" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Seniors Go Digital</u> 
</a>, we aim to equip individuals of all ages and backgrounds with technology
usage confidence and knowledge.</p>
<p>These programmes may seem basic, but they are an important foundation
for one to navigate the intricacies of the digital world.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs never too late to learn!</p>
<h3>Tackling problems from multiple perspectives</h3>
<p>All organisations have blindspots, but we try to minimise ours by constantly
learning and improving through the use of testing tools and engagement
with citizen communities.</p>
<p>One particular project we‚Äôre extremely proud of is <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/design/purple-a11y/overview.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Purple A11y</u></a>,
an open-source automated testing tool developed by our <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/design/purple-a11y/meet-the-team" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>A11y Team</u></a>.
The tool is even listed internationally on the Digital Public Good Registry
by the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/digit.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Digital Public Goods Alliance</u></a>!</p>
<p>Since its launch in July 2023, it has identified 6.4 million accessibility
issues and scanned over 500,000 websites worldwide, with 57% being Singapore-based
pages and 43% from everywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Purple A11y currently plays a key role in identifying and suggesting mitigating
ways to resolve potential accessibility issues on government websites ‚Äî
think agencies like MOE, IRAS, and NEA! In addition, government agencies
are also guided by the <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/digital-standards-and-guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Digital Service Standards (DSS)</u></a> when
designing digital services. The idea is to make products that are accessible,
inclusive, usable, and relevant.</p>
<p>Last but not least, our <a href="/our-communities/join-our-communities/tech-kaki/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Tech Kaki community</u></a> allows
citizens to actively participate in evaluating the accessibility of digital
services, providing valuable feedback to us.</p>
<h3>It‚Äôs all about the ecosystem</h3>
<p>United we stand, divided we fall. Or so the saying goes.</p>
<p>We believe that collaboration with industry and community partners is
essential for creating an ecosystem of accessible services. Our annual
<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/events/a11y-week-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>A11y Week</u> 
</a>, a digital inclusion learning festival for public officers, showcases
the importance of partnerships in driving progress.</p>
<p>This year‚Äôs event features sharings by leading industry players like Apple,
Microsoft, and Smart BFA, emphasising the theme ‚ÄúProgress over Perfection.‚Äù</p>
<p>The inaugural Co-Creation Lab, launched at A11y Week 2024, will further
foster collaboration between the government, industry, and end-users. This
initiative aims to create a platform for ongoing dialogue and co-creation,
ensuring that Singapore‚Äôs digital services are truly accessible and inclusive
for all.</p>
<h2>Inclusivity is in the Singaporean DNA</h2>
<p>As countries around the world grapple with the digital divide, let‚Äôs do
our best to stay together. Our National Pledge says that Singaporeans are
one united people, regardless of race, language or religion.</p>
<p>Well, in the digital era, we‚Äôll go one step further and add ability to
that list.</p>
