<p>TL:DR: In the past, going digital often meant that an organisation had
to build its own expensive servers and data centres from scratch. With
cloud computing, governments and enterprises can bypass the hardware procurement
phase to rapidly develop digital solutions. Experts from Google and Microsoft
shared more on the potential of the cloud at the STACK 2018 Developer Conference
organised by GovTech.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clouds on the horizon signal an oncoming storm, and entire landscapes
can be transformed in the wake of a squall. In the digital realm, cloud
computing has had a similar effect, completely disrupting the way governments
and enterprises operate.</p>
<p>While cloud computing has only become a buzzword in recent years, the
idea of using a computer as if it were a public utility—like water or electricity—was
planted as early as the 1970s. The late American computer scientist John
McCarthy envisioned that a single computer could serve the needs of multiple
individuals or organisations, such that “each subscriber needs to pay only
for the capacity he actually uses, but he has access to all programming
languages characteristic of a very large system.”</p>
<p>This has indeed become the norm, with companies like Google and Microsoft
offering their computing resources as a platform for other enterprises
to run their operations online. At the inaugural STACK 2018 Developer Conference
organised by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), experts
from the two tech giants shared how organisations can ride the wave of
cloud-mediated disruption and emerge stronger than before.</p>
<h3>Being comfortable with change</h3>
<p>“Disruption occurs when something radically changes,” said Mr Gregor Hohpe,
technical director, office of the CTO, Google Cloud, during his keynote
address. But it is the response to change that determines the survival
of the disrupted.</p>
<p>Using the analogy of a steam-powered train at the cusp of the invention
of electric trains, Mr Hohpe highlighted a fatal mistake that organisations
could make in the face of fundamental changes in their operating environment.
“When somebody comes along with something very different, when somebody
disrupts your business, the worst thing that you can do is to try to put
more coals in the boiler,” he said. “In the end, all you’re going to get
is a giant accident.”</p>
<p>What’s really needed is a fundamental shift in the organisation’s mindset
and processes, and this can be very difficult to achieve, especially in
the context of IT systems.</p>
<p>“Anybody who has worked in an IT environment knows this little slogan:
never touch a running system [lest you break it]. So they have learned
that change implies risk. But even worse, they have also learned that by
not touching it, nothing will go wrong, so they have learned that ‘no change
implies no risk’,” he explained, adding that “in today’s environment, nothing
could be further from the truth.”</p>
<p>For instance, by keeping the old version of an operating system, organisations
open themselves to cybersecurity risks which could cripple their operations.
Hence, there is an exorbitant price to pay for maintaining the status quo,
said Mr Hohpe.</p>
<h3>A need for speed</h3>
<p>Even when organisations acknowledge the need to change and begin to update
their IT systems, they tend to think of the process as a transition from
a current state to a “target picture” or desired state. Mr Hohpe noted
that this is a dated approach. “With innovation, we don’t know where we’re
actually headed. There’s some stuff that works and other stuff that doesn’t,
so the digital world has no target picture.”</p>
<p>An iterative approach to software and application development is thus
necessary, and “the more things you can try, the better off you are,” he
added. “Now, if it’s all about moving fast, then the first question you
should ask is: how do we move faster?”</p>
<p>There are two ways to do this, according to Mr Hohpe. The first is to
reduce the lead time for getting things done. “If you can start [innovating]
right away instead of having to build stuff up from scratch, you’ve got
a head start,” he said. The second strategy would be to simply get things
done more quickly. In both aspects, cloud computing is a powerful enabler.</p>
<p>“When we start talking about taking advantage of the cloud, we’re talking
about diminishing limitations,” said Mr Steven Murawski, lead cloud ops
advocate, Microsoft, in his keynote address. “[With cloud computing] you
don’t have to acquire servers, set up a data centre, do the cabling and
so on—the cloud service providers do that for you. What that really enables
you to do is to try new ideas quickly.”</p>
<p>Mr Hohpe echoed this point, advising the audience to “move fast, frequently
deploy your software and get feedback from users.” Then rinse and repeat.</p>

<h3>The price is right</h3>
<p>Another critical benefit of building applications on cloud-based infrastructure
is the flexibility of scaling and pricing. In the past, developers would
have had to budget in (at the outset) all the capabilities that would go
into a software or operating system. Development costs could therefore
add up to a daunting amount of money. Now, with the dynamic pricing framework
of the cloud, developers can create, test and implement individual software
features at a low cost, then pay more to scale up only useful features.</p>
<p>More importantly, Mr Murawski emphasised that cloud computing allows organisations
to directly measure the cost of running a particular online service, which
can then be associated with the value that it delivers to clients or citizens.</p>
<p>“That lets [organisations] make better decisions about where they invest
their time, effort and compute resources,” he said. By granting governments
and enterprises the ability to partition their resources more nimbly and
track their return on investment, the entire process of developing software
or applications becomes more efficient.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, Mr Murawski reminded the audience that cloud
computing is merely a platform that offers greater convenience and useful
tools for developers to flesh out ideas rapidly, and in a cost-effective
manner. Those ideas—and the pain points they address—need to come from
within the organisation.</p>
<p>“You are going to have to identify the processes that need to change,
and the things that will help you benefit from these platforms. I can’t
tell you what’s going to work optimally. You’ll have to decide for yourselves
how to leverage [cloud computing] to deliver the best solutions to your
consumers, citizens and stakeholders,” he concluded.</p>
