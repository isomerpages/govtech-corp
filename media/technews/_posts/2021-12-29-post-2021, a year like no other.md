<p>As 2021 draws to a close, we look back at how our tech solutions have
helped you, our fellow citizens and residents of Singapore, live a little
better and stay a little safer.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a story that we all might be familiar with - a story of time and
how we never seem to have enough of it. As we went about our daily lives
in the past year, we hope the use of our tech helped give time back to
spend with your loved ones and on things that matter most.</p>

<p>What an eventful year 2021 has been. In the 2nd year of the pandemic,
our fight against the evolving coronavirus continues as the world adjusts
to its â€˜new normalâ€™ We at GovTech continue to harness the power of technology
with the goal of making lives better in Singapore, even as some of our
teams were at the â€˜frontlineâ€™ of developing and enhancing products that
help in our management of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a look back at some of the projects that we are most grateful for
in 2021:</p>
