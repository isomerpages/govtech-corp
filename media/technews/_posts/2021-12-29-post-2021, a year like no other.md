<p>As 2021 draws to a close, we look back at how our tech solutions have
helped you, our fellow citizens and residents of Singapore, live a little
better and stay a little safer.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a story that we all might be familiar with - a story of time and
how we never seem to have enough of it. As we went about our daily lives
in the past year, we hope the use of our tech helped give time back to
spend with your loved ones and on things that matter most.</p>

<p>What an eventful year 2021 has been. In the 2nd year of the pandemic,
our fight against the evolving coronavirus continues as the world adjusts
to its â€˜new normalâ€™ We at GovTech continue to harness the power of technology
with the goal of making lives better in Singapore, even as some of our
teams were at the â€˜frontlineâ€™ of developing and enhancing products that
help in our management of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a look back at some of the projects that we are most grateful for
in 2021:</p>

<h3>2. TraceTogether</h3>
<p>One of our nationâ€™s key tools against the pandemic, TraceTogether, has
become a big part of the nationâ€™s effort to stay safe during this pandemic.
With TraceTogether, the time it takes for contact tracing has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/time-for-contact-tracing-cut-by-more-than-half-with-tracetogether-safeentry" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">reduced from four days to just a single day!</a>&nbsp;Lastly,

<h3>The heroes behind the scenes!</h3>

all the gardens and parks in Singapore. Keep your distance and keep safe.</p>

Launched in June,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedigitalacademy.tech.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Digital Academy</a>&nbsp;was
set up as a â€˜Practitioner for Practitionerâ€™ academy to give all public
officers a platform to â€˜level up, skill up and gain XPâ€™, by offering a
robust suite of information and communications technology (ICT) programmes
that are contextualised to the public service! Armed with new and/or updated
digital skills and know-how, public officers can contribute confidently
to the digitalisation of public service and thrive in their careers!</p>
