<p>Websites ‚Äì they‚Äôre the basic building blocks of the internet. Whether
they‚Äôre carrying videos, photos, or text, websites today come in all manners
of sophisticated and eye-catching design.</p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt always like this of course. People who‚Äôve been surfing cyberspace
for more than two decades will know this. Naturally, the tools for website
creation would have developed over the years as well.</p>
<p>So, let‚Äôs start at the beginning and trace the evolution of the internet.</p>
<h3>HTML or nothing</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôre even vaguely familiar with website architecture, you would have
heard of the term HTML, or the Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
<p>This programming language was invented in the early 1990s by people working
at CERN, also known as the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (they‚Äôre
also the people more recently behind the giant particle accelerator called
the Large Hadron Collider).</p>
<p>It enabled them to organise information into columns and rows by using
the &lt;table&gt; function. Because they intended only to create a fully
text-based website, HTML sufficed at that point. (Though it should be noted
that while websites today are far more complex, HTML remains the fundamental
foundation of a lot of stuff online.)</p>
<p>With HTML at their disposal, the CERN folks launched‚Ä¶</p>
<h3>The very first website</h3>
<p>It was made out of entirely text about what the ‚ÄúWorld Wide Web‚Äù was.
Looks-wise, it can plainly be described as a list of hyperlinks.</p>
<p>But you don‚Äôt have to take our word for it, the website is still online
after more than 20 years, so&nbsp;<a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">check it out for yourself!</a>&nbsp;You‚Äôll
see that the default blue text for hyperlinks was already a thing back
then.</p>
<h3>The search engine is born</h3>
<p>Just two years after the world‚Äôs first website was introduced, Aliweb
‚Äì regarded as the first search engine ‚Äì came online.</p>
<p>It not only organised links into helpful categories such as entertainment,
living, and shopping, but it also deployed colour to make the site more
user-friendly and easier to navigate.</p>
<h3>Web development leaps forward</h3>
<p>The mid-1990s were crucial years in the history of web development. The
programming language JavaScript was introduced in 1995, allowing motion
and interactive effects to be added to erstwhile static sites.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the release of a new version of HTML, HTML 2.0,
enabled support for graphics and other forms beyond simple tables.</p>
<p>The next year, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) made its debut. While HTML
continued to handle the content of a site, CSS governed its style and was
where elements like colour and typography were outlined.</p>
<p>Macromedia Flash also took the stage, enabling web animation to be displayed.
This required the Flash plugin extension, and some of you would remember
blank areas on websites when the plugin was not installed.</p>
<p>Flash had a good run of about 25 years before Adobe pulled the plug by
ending support and Windows removed it from all browsers.</p>
<h3>Of blogs and social media</h3>
<p>The turn of the century, from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, saw the
rise of user-generated content.</p>
<p>Firstly, writing an online log of our daily lives and thoughts became
a worldwide phenomenon and several content management systems ‚Äì Blogger,
Open Diary, Live Journal, WordPress, to name a few ‚Äì sprouted to meet the
demand of seemingly everyone wanting a personal blog.</p>
<p>WordPress, in particular, has come to dominate the content management
system landscape, powering over half of websites today that use such a
system.</p>
<p>As for social media, MySpace was launched in 2003, followed by Facebook
the next year. One of them is no longer around, while the other is now
a juggernaut in online advertising and owns other popular apps like WhatsApp
and Instagram.</p>
<h3>The mobile era dawns</h3>
<p>With the explosion in popularity of smartphones from the mid-2000s onwards,
surfing the web on small screens became increasingly common.</p>
<p>Websites no longer had to look good on desktop monitors but also on screens
in the palms of users. Responsive web design became the buzzword, and websites
scrambled to be able to detect the type of device and translate their content
accordingly.</p>
<p>The responsive web movement was given added urgency when Google began
accounting for having a responsive web design in its search ranking.</p>
<h3>Website as a service</h3>
<p>Another relatively new development is the advent of website builders with
easy-to-use services for anyone who wants to build a website. They can
click, drag and drop to design their websites instead of having to code.</p>
<p>These builders also offer to host your newly built site for a fee, delivering
an end-to-end product. Aspiring website owners can do it themselves without
having to learn coding and deal with the intricacies of hosting a website.</p>
<h3>Digitalisation keeps rolling</h3>
<p>Websites will doubtless continue to evolve. The government is committed
to keeping pace with tech advances and helping Singaporeans along in the
digitalisation journey, such as through <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/smes-go-digital" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IMDA‚Äôs&nbsp;SMEs Go Digital </a>

<p>Hopefully, we‚Äôve also inspired you to try out building your own website,
be it through a website building service or perhaps going old-school and
