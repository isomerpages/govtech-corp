<p>Just how tough is it nowadays to spot AI-generated scams? Pretty tough,
it turns out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/what-happens-when-it-becomes-almost-impossible-to-spot-a-scam-even-for-experts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Global Anti-Scam Summit Asia 2024</u></a> in
October, a room of about 100 anti-scam experts were asked to stand. They
were then shown one video at a time and asked if it was real or AI-generated.
Those who got the answer wrong had to take their seats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After just three rounds, only a handful of the experts from law enforcement,
financial institutions, and tech giants were left standing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, scams are becoming more deceptive, no thanks to the nefarious
use of AI to generate ever more deceptive content to fool us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With over <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/13-of-phishing-scams-analysed-likely-to-be-ai-generated-csa" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>10% of scams last year generated by AI</u></a>,
it’s all the more important to learn how to protect ourselves. Read on
to find out more about how these scams are run, what we can do to avoid
falling victim, and what tools are out there to help us!&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How AI scams get under our skin&nbsp;</h3>
<p>AI scams often mix familiar scam methods and then use AI-generated content
to add a sheen of authenticity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, email users frequently get spam and other assorted scams
targeting them, but AI-driven scams have taken things to the next level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hackers are using AI-generated voice technology to mimic <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/10/13/new-gmail-security-alert-for-billions-as-7-day-ai-hack-confirmed/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Google support agents</u></a> in
fake calls. These are often coordinated with deceptive account recovery
notifications, guiding users to fraudulent login pages.</p>
<p>One tech professional described how he almost fell for a scam and saw
through the ruse only because he detected a subtle, robotic cadence to
a phone call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our online behaviour is enabling AI-generated scams, as
social media videos are being used to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/18/warning-social-media-videos-exploited-scammers-clone-voices" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u> clone our voices</u></a>.
It takes just three seconds of audio to clone one’s voice. The scammers
can then call or send voicemails to friends and family, asking them to
send money urgently.</p>

<h3>What Singapore is doing to keep us safe</h3>
<p>Thankfully, the scammers aren’t the only ones using AI. GovTech, alongside
the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Singapore Police Force, has developed
some powerful tools to protect us from these threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Scam Analytics and Technical Intervention System (SATIS)</h4>
<p>Instead of merely reacting to scams after people have fallen victim, the
authorities are on the hunt for online scams through the Scam Analytics
and Technical Intervention System (<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/scams-spf-govtech-technology-4144416" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>SATIS</u></a>).
A joint collaboration between the Ministry of Home Affairs and GovTech,
SATIS consolidates threat intelligence from crowdsourced initiatives such
as <a href="https://www.scamshield.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield</a> and
from partners such as SPF police reports. It also proactively hunts and
automatically gathers information online.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The tool then employs Machine Learning technology to analyse these sites.
Known as the<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/cybersecurity/rmse/overview.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;Recursive Machine Learning Site Evaluator (rMSE)</a>,
it works together with <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SATIS</a> to
analyse over a million websites a month. Once it flags a site as suspicious,
it sends the info to Google Web Risk, making sure the site gets blocked
worldwide on supported browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of October 2024, over 59,000 harmful sites – ranging from job scams
to bogus e-commerce portals – have been disrupted.</p>
<hr>
<h3>&nbsp;Keeping yourself safe</h3>
<p>Although the Government is proactively fighting scams, we must also do
our part by protecting ourselves.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Get the ScamShield app</h4>
<p>If you haven’t already, download the <a href="https://www.scamshield.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>ScamShield</u></a> app. It’s a
handy tool that blocks scam calls and messages to your phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, it also lets you report scams directly and verify suspicious
messages. Once a number, messenger, or link is submitted to <a href="https://www.scamshield.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ScamShield</a>,
it will check if it’s from a verified source such as the government or
registered businesses. It will also compare the input with known scam messages,
numbers, and links and inform you of the results.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Identify legitimate government messages</h4>
<p>Since July 2024, all SMSes from the government come from the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/what-happens-when-it-becomes-almost-impossible-to-spot-a-scam-even-for-experts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>gov.sg</u></a>
<a href="https://www.sms.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u> sender ID</u>
</a>, which is protected for use only by government agencies. Telecom operators
assist to block any sender IDs that try to look like <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/what-happens-when-it-becomes-almost-impossible-to-spot-a-scam-even-for-experts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p>Besides, bearing the same sender ID in lowercase, SMSes will begin with
the full name of the agency (such as Central Provident Fund Board), end
with the signature “This is an automated message sent by the Singapore
Government”, and will be grouped together into a single conversation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What to do if you’ve been scammed&nbsp;</h3>
<p>If you do fall victim to a scam, don’t panic – here’s what to do:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Contact your bank immediately so that the bank can freeze your account
to prevent further loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File a police report online or at the nearest police post.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure your accounts by changing your passwords and enabling two-factor
authentication (2FA). Let your contacts know if your social media or email
accounts have been hacked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For e-commerce scams, report the incident to the platform. Include all
the details you have, like screenshots and the scammer’s account info.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3>New scams call for renewed vigilance</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Gone are the days when online scams come riddled with misspellings, laughably
obvious get-rich-quick schemes, and other assorted giant red flags.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking “it could never happen to me”, think instead that
“it could very well happen to me”. By following the tips here and adopting
a healthy dose of scepticism to what you see online, we can ensure that
we keep ourselves safe in the wild wild web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educating ourselves about AI’s potential to have both negative and positive
effects on us will also go a long way, so check out GovTech’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIruNSlMpks" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>vodcast</u></a> on
AI and online scams.&nbsp;</p>
