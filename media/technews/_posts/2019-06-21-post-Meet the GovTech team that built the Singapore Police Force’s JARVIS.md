<h3>The Singapore Police Force unveiled a new screening platform called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/news-and-publications/features/Police%20Workplan%20Seminar%202019%20-%20A%20Smart%20Force%20for%20the%20Nation" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JARVIS</a>&nbsp;at the 2019 Police Workplan Seminar. We tell the story of how a team at GovTech conceptualised and developed JARVIS.</h3>
<p>Remember the popular television series Criminal Minds and CSI? Regardless
of which team of investigators you were enamoured with and rooting for,
there was always this intelligence officer character sitting in front of
a computer, punching in queries on a keyboard and calling up details of
a person of interest almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>While this makes for good plot progression, information searches almost
never happen that quickly in real life.</p>
<p>Collating and extracting information stored in multiple databases is time-consuming.
Depending on how the data is labelled and how the database is structured,
there may be restrictions on the types of searches that can be performed.
Investigation officers at the Singapore Police Force (SPF) know this all
too well; sometimes, obtaining information about a potential perpetrator
could take up to 20 minutes‚Äîway too long, in their opinion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInformation was kept in separate databases, so investigation officers
needed to log on to multiple screening systems to conduct searches‚Äîand
the speed of the searches was slow,‚Äù said Deputy Superintendent of Police
(DSP) Zhang Yitao, a product manager of joint systems at the SPF.</p>
<p>Given this issue, the SPF approached the Government Technology Agency
of Singapore (GovTech) to explore a faster, more intelligent way to go
about this screening process. This was the beginning of a collaboration
that resulted in a screening platform called JARVIS, unveiled at the Police
Workplan Seminar on 11 April 2019.</p>
<h3>Fix the right problem</h3>
<p>Alluding to the ‚ÄòJust A Rather Very Intelligent System‚Äô from Marvel‚Äôs
‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù comics, the SPF‚Äôs JARVIS platform surprisingly does not rely
on artificial intelligence (AI) to function. This was a deliberate decision
taken by the GovTech team after going down to the police stations to speak
to investigation officers and observe how they were performing searches
on pre-existing systems, said Ms Ang Yi Xin, a UX designer at GovTech.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe first thing that stood out to us was that searches do not have to
be so slow,‚Äù added Mr Li Hongyi, deputy director of Open Government Products
(OGP) at GovTech. ‚ÄúEven though the users were asking for a lot of AI features,
the actual problem that we decided to fix was the speed of the database.
The idea was to make JARVIS like Google‚Äîeven if you don‚Äôt get what you
want the first time, you can just search again and get another set of results
really quickly.‚Äù</p>
<p>Achieving faster search speeds entailed optimising databases for generic
text queries. Simply put, each letter is mapped to a pre-built index of
other relevant terms or data points, which can be rapidly surfaced to the
user. This not only accelerates the search process significantly but also
increases the range of possible queries on a single platform, added Mr
Alwyn Tan, technical lead at GovTech. ‚ÄúIt does open up new ways to dive
into information,‚Äù he quipped.</p>
<h3>Faster and more intuitive</h3>
<p>The GovTech team also paid attention to the perceived performance of JARVIS,
making small but tangible tweaks so that users would find the screening
platform more responsive.</p>
<p>‚ÄúInitially, JARVIS would fetch all the information [it could find] and
display the entire page of results. But that took some time, and users
may be frustrated by the appreciable lag. So what I did instead was to
programme JARVIS to fetch and display even the smallest bit of relevant
information that it finds, adding new information onto the results page
when it comes in,‚Äù explained Mr Nikhil Choudhary, software engineer at
GovTech. This provides investigation officers with some information to
chew on even as the search continues in the background.</p>
<p>Mr Choudhary even went as far as to make JARVIS initiate a search the
moment a keyboard key is depressed rather than when it was released, noting
that this results in several milliseconds in time savings. ‚ÄúEven really
small things like that add up,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ms Ang focused on making the user interface (UI) of JARVIS
more intuitive so that investigative officers can easily locate and execute
specific functions on the screening platform. ‚ÄúI think UI is core to speed
because if the UI is poorly designed, then you are ten button clicks away
from your answer rather than two,‚Äù she said.</p>
<h3>Safe within and without</h3>
<p>With these enhancements in place, JARVIS was tested by investigation officers
between March and November 2018 and has since been used by more than 2,000
police personnel to positive reviews. One specific use case? Scalping incidents
on online marketplace platforms.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnline scams largely fit the same mould‚Äîsomeone with numerous online
monikers selling concert tickets that don‚Äôt actually exist. Everybody who
gets scammed is going to lodge a police report. What JARVIS allows you
to do is realise that all these reports involve the same culprit with the
amount of information it provides in an intuitive interface,‚Äù DSP Zhang
explained. ‚ÄúSo basically, JARVIS has enabled us to fight scam cases more
efficiently.‚Äù</p>
<p>But ‚Äúwith great power comes great responsibility‚Äù, to borrow a quote from
Marvel‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpiderman‚Äù comics, so the GovTech team has incorporated security
measures into JARVIS to prevent it from being abused. Every search performed
on JARVIS is logged to ensure accountability.</p>
<p>While JARVIS may be a different product than what the SPF may have envisioned,
it is already making a difference in the Home Team‚Äôs operations, trimming
search times by more than 75 per cent.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe original goal never changed‚Äîit was always to help triple nine responders
search information more quickly and to help investigation officers solve
cases more efficiently,‚Äù Mr Li concluded.</p>
