<h3>Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as a means of customer engagement. The Singapore government now has its own chatbot ‚ÄîAsk Jamie‚Äî that can field questions from citizens and provide them with the relevant answers.</h3>
<p>Here‚Äôs a scenario most of us would be familiar with: you call up an organisation‚Äôs
24-hour helpline to make an enquiry, only to listen to a robotic voice
read you options like, ‚ÄúPress ‚Äò1‚Äô if you would like to find out more about
service A. Press ‚Äò2‚Äô if you would like to find out more about service B‚Äù.</p>
<p>You feel your patience wearing thin as the interactive voice response
system goes down its list, a frustrating parody of a guessing game, until
finally, it arrives at something that sounds remotely related to your actual
enquiry. You press ‚Äò7‚Äô, and the machine starts rattling off another list.
You give up.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with the advent of chatbots, a more direct route to information
is now available. These virtual assistants, relying on a machine learning
technique known as natural language processing, are clever enough to hold
a conversation and provide answers to specific questions. Today, if you
visit the website of a Singapore government agency, you‚Äôll notice on the
right side of your internet browser a tab called ‚ÄòAsk Jamie‚Äô. This is the
whole-of-government virtual assistant, a pleasant-looking chatbot ever
ready to assist citizens.</p>
<h3>Ask and it shall be answered</h3>
<p>The idea of creating an intelligent chatbot for government agencies was
seeded in 2014, after a survey revealed that approximately half of the
queries by visitors to government agencies were general enquiries. For
example, people may want to know their eligibility for the Baby Bonus scheme,
or what MediShield Life is about.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuch questions have relatively straightforward and standard answers,
which a chatbot is well positioned to handle,‚Äù said Ms Lorraine Ong, executive
manager at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech). ‚ÄúThe
conversational way of interacting with Ask Jamie is also more intuitive
for citizens,‚Äù she added.</p>
<p>Trained on a vast repository of Q&amp;As between citizens and staffers
at government agencies, Ask Jamie has become proficient at identifying
keywords in questions and giving accurate replies. Should a question prove
more complex than it can handle, Ask Jamie knows how to escalate it to
the relevant party, either via a form or via a live chat. Importantly,
any officer that subsequently responds to an ‚Äòescalated‚Äô query will have
received the conversation history between Ask Jamie and the enquirer, which
helps set the context for follow-up correspondence, Ms Ong explained.</p>
<h3>From conversations to transactions</h3>
<p>Now almost five years old, Ask Jamie is picking up some new tricks to
make interactions between citizens and the government more seamless. Going
beyond answering questions, Ask Jamie can now mitigate some transactions
as well.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor example, if you want to do an online opt-in for your CPF statement,
you can actually do that using Ask Jamie. If you go to the IRAS portal,
you can even use Ask Jamie to check if you need to file taxes this year.
You‚Äôll be directed to log in using SingPass, and you can proceed with transacting
from there,‚Äù said Mr Zhuo Shaowei, manager at GovTech.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although text may be a convenient medium of interaction with
a chatbot, Ms Ong and Mr Zhuo highlighted that Ask Jamie can now recognise
speech as well.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe now have Ask Jamie Voice, where the virtual assistant answers calls
directly, using voice recognition to convert speech to text [which is then
processed],‚Äù said Ms Ong. This function has been rolled out with the Ministry
of Social and Family Development and the Ministry of Education, representing
the first step towards better integration of virtual assistants into a
broader ecosystem of multi-avenue citizen engagement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs technology continues to improve, we want Ask Jamie to evolve to become
more functional and helpful,‚Äù Mr Zhuo noted.</p>
<h3>Tips for interacting with Ask Jamie</h3>
<p>For readers who want to hold an efficient yet meaningful conversation
with Ask Jamie, here are some best practices to keep in mind:</p>
<p><strong>1. Read the list of ‚Äòmost popular‚Äô questions first</strong>
</p>
<p>Each government agency has compiled a list of frequently asked questions
it receives from citizens. When you click on the Ask Jamie tab, these questions
are surfaced immediately, with links to the relevant answers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Pay attention to the ‚ÄòAre you looking for‚Äô options</strong>
</p>
<p>As you type in your question, Ask Jamie will try to predict what you are
searching for and provide suggestions, much like the autofill function
in the Google search bar.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ask one question per sentence</strong>
</p>
<p>For example, instead of asking ‚ÄòHow can I appeal a traffic fine and what
are the grounds for appeal?‚Äô, consider splitting your question into two
separate sentences, i.e., ‚ÄòHow can I appeal a traffic offence?‚Äô followed
by ‚ÄòWhat are the grounds for appealing a traffic offence?‚Äô.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be concise</strong>
</p>
<p>Keep your questions short and sweet. Remember, the chatbot is looking
out for keywords in your question, so don‚Äôt confuse it with an essay of
background information describing the circumstances leading up to your
query.</p>
<p><strong>5. Speak slowly when using Ask Jamie Voice</strong>
</p>
<p>To help Ask Jamie accurately understand what you are saying, avoid areas
with loud background noises and speak at a slow and measured pace.</p>
