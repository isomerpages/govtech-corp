<p>Scams are a persistent threat worldwide, and Singapore is no exception.</p>
<p>Recent reports by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) indicate a troubling
rise in scam cases, with a staggering 47% increase from 2022 to 2023. This
highlights the urgent need for effective anti-scam measures.</p>
<h3>Why are Scams Still on the Rise?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in combating <a href="/media/technews/top-five-scams-in-singapore-and-how-to-protect-yourself" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>online scams</u></a> is
their ever-evolving nature. Scammers constantly adapt their tactics, making
it crucial for anti-scam efforts to be equally dynamic.</p>
<p>As Mr. Mark Chen, Principal Product Manager, Anti-Scam Products at GovTech,
aptly points out, "It's not a one-time fix. The scammers will react quickly
and develop evasion techniques." This underscores the need for continuous
vigilance and improvement.</p>
<p>With that said, here’s what we’ve been doing from the forefront on the
war of scams:</p>
<h3>Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS)</h3>
<p>A collaboration between GovTech, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and
the SPF, <a href="/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SATIS</a> is
an advanced system that builds upon the success of PhishMonSG – an earlier
tool.
<br>
<br>SATIS actively hunts for and disrupts scam sites, extending its reach
beyond government websites to include phishing attempts by banks, malware-hosting
sites, and those used in impersonation scams.</p>
<p>For instance, GovTech recently identified a spoofed SPF website which
mimicked the official URL but redirected users to a malicious site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further strengthen SATIS’ reach, we partnered with Google to leverage
their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/products/web-risk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Web Risk</u></a> feature.
This feature blocks reported scam websites on popular browsers like Chrome,
Firefox, and Safari, preventing users from accessing them. So far, GovTech
has successfully disrupted over 16,000 potentially harmful sites.</p>
<h3>Recursive Machine-Learning Site Evaluator (rMSE)</h3>
<p>Developed in collaboration with the SPF and the Cyber Security Agency
of Singapore, rMSE is a powerful software tool that can assess hundreds
of thousands of suspicious websites daily with over 90% precision. It does
this by analyzing elements like URLs and logos, comparing them against
authentic sources to identify potential scams.
<br>
<br>This enables us to detect, analyse, and disrupt scam sites swiftly and
accurately, significantly scaling up Singapore's anti-scam efforts.</p>
<h3>ScamShield App</h3>
<p>Developed by Open Government Products under GovTech, the <a href="https://www.scamshield.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>ScamShield app</u></a> is
a user-friendly mobile application that safeguards users from scam calls.
<br>
<br>It works by cross-referencing unknown numbers with a database maintained
by the SPF. Numbers flagged as being linked to scams are automatically
blocked. Additionally, ScamShield employs an on-device algorithm to analyse
incoming messages and identify potential scams.</p>
<p>The team also created the ScamShield Bot, designed to simplify scam reporting.
Users can simply forward suspicious messages received on platforms like
WhatsApp to the bot, which then reports them to the SPF.</p>
<h3>Stay Informed, Stay Safe</h3>
<p>By harnessing the power of technology, GovTech is making significant strides
in safeguarding Singapore's citizens from the ever-present threat of scams.
<br>
<br>Yet, while we <em>lead</em> the battle against scams, what will really,
really move the needle is an educated citizenry. So, arm yourselves with
knowledge and stay vigilant!

we can create a safer digital space for everyone in Singapore.</p>
