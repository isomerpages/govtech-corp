<p>
<br>Scams are a persistent threat worldwide, and Singapore is no exception.</p>
<p>Recent reports by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) indicate a troubling
rise in scam cases, with a staggering 47% increase from 2022 to 2023. This
highlights the urgent need for effective anti-scam measures.</p>
<h3>Why are Scams Still on the Rise?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in combating <a href="/media/technews/top-five-scams-in-singapore-and-how-to-protect-yourself" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>online scams</u></a> is
their ever-evolving nature. Scammers constantly adapt their tactics, making
it crucial for anti-scam efforts to be equally dynamic.</p>
<p>As Mr. Mark Chen, Principal Product Manager, Anti-Scam Products at GovTech,
aptly points out, "It's not a one-time fix. The scammers will react quickly
and develop evasion techniques." This underscores the need for continuous
vigilance and improvement.</p>
<p>With that said, here’s what we’ve been doing from the forefront on the
war of scams:</p>
<h3>Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS)</h3>
<p>
<br>A collaboration between GovTech, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and
the SPF, SATIS is an advanced system that builds upon the success of PhishMonSG
– an earlier tool.
<br>
<br>SATIS actively hunts for and disrupts scam sites, extending its reach
beyond government websites to include phishing attempts by banks, malware-hosting
sites, and those used in impersonation scams.</p>
<p>For instance, GovTech recently identified a spoofed SPF website which
mimicked the official URL but redirected users to a malicious site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further strengthen SATIS’ reach, we partnered with Google to leverage
their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/products/web-risk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Web Risk</u></a> feature.
This feature blocks reported scam websites on popular browsers like Chrome,
Firefox, and Safari, preventing users from accessing them. So far, GovTech
has successfully disrupted over 16,000 potentially harmful sites.</p>
