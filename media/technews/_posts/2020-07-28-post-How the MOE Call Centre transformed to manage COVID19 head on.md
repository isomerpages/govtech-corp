<h3>As you already know, Singaporean parents are very involved in their children‚Äôs development.</h3>

</p>
<p>So, it‚Äôs no surprise that the MOE Call Centre (MOE CC) had to handle a
surge in calls from parents and other stakeholders since the start of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Just to give you an idea, here‚Äôs a rough summary of
the nature of calls handled by MOE CC over the past few months:</p>
<p><strong>Jan - March:</strong>&nbsp;Parents asked about the precautionary
measures undertaken by schools to ensure the safety and well-being of their
children, e.g. seeking clarifications on travel declarations, Leave Of
Absence, mask-wearing guidelines etc.</p>
<p><strong>Late March:</strong>&nbsp;Tuition/enrichment centres had to suspend
their operations. Call enquiries surged from these centres as well as from
parents, seeking clarifications on the advisory and alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Early April:</strong>&nbsp;When Home Based Learning (HBL) was
announced, there was another surge of calls from parents asking about the
scope of HBL, alternative childcare arrangements, definition of ‚Äòessential
services‚Äô etc.</p>
<h3>MOE Call Centre adjusted to manage the sudden volume and accelerated our ability to WFH</h3>
<p>On one hand, we wanted to enable our staff to be able to answer calls
and serve our public customers from home, as this would mean reducing the
risk of Covid-19 exposure for ourselves and our families.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this meant our staff needed to be able to remotely
access MOE‚Äôs Call and IT systems from home. We had never done this, because
we met with all sorts of challenges in all our previous tests! We were
very uncertain how this could work.</p>
<p>We knew it would tax the existing VPN network with both voice and data
traffic and were unsure if our officers‚Äô home networks would be stable
enough to ensure undisrupted call connectivity and reasonable call audio
quality.</p>
<p>The main concern? We did not want to frustrate the public if we could
not hear each other properly, or worse still, have calls dropped midway
through a conversation! There was definitely apprehension.</p>
<p>Given that MOE did not have the recommended QOS (Quality of Service) for
our LAN/VPN network infrastructure, maintaining call audio quality was
also a concern. COVID-19 was truly an unprecedented event, and no one in
2019 could have foreseen that we‚Äôd all be working from home en masse in
2020.</p>
<h3>To overcome this, we worked A LOT harder so MOE CC could serve our customers seamlessly</h3>
<p>Our team could only carry out most of the system configuration work and
testing for our Call System after our hotline operating hours, to minimise
service disruption to the public ‚Äì kinda like how SMRT does track maintenance.</p>
<p>Our team worked round the clock, including weekends and public holidays,
with daily conference calls (due to the COVID-19 situation) to meticulously
resolve and track project progress which included end-to-end testing, validating
results and fixing issues expeditiously and effectively through close collaboration.</p>
<h3>Some useful learning points:</h3>

</p>
<p><strong>Always bring in the experts early</strong>&nbsp;- The network
team was brought in to join us in our daily teleconference with our vendors.
This enabled more direct communication amongst the technical experts (both
from MOE and vendors) which facilitated faster resolution of issues.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate with empathy</strong>&nbsp;- Seeking to understand
one another‚Äôs priorities, identify the conflicting ones and discuss, de-conflict
and agree on the most viable option. Being able to discuss, and at times
argue openly, objectively and focusing on the end goal would move the collaborative
projects along quicker, and more productively.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and teamwork</strong>&nbsp;‚Äì Having workdays that stretched
till 2 am was definitely taxing on us, but two objectives kept us going.</p>
<p>The first was that for every passing day that the solution was not in
place, our frontline colleagues would have to commute into MOE to attend
to calls from the public. Now, more than ever, they needed to cater to
the needs of their children who were undergoing home-based learning and
other family members during this challenging COVID-19 period. The second
was that, in times of crisis, maintaining communication with the public
was paramount, and delivering reliable and consistent service was of utmost
concern to assure the public. These were always at the top of our minds.</p>
<p>Our officers at MOE CC might not be putting their lives at risk like medical
personnel, but they, too, have an important role ‚Äì keeping parents calm,
informed and reassured during such turbulent times.</p>
<p>As for us? We‚Äôre just glad to have made WFH possible for our MOE CC colleagues
so they could balance their children/families‚Äô needs and continue to serve
the parents and public well throughout this crisis. ‚ò∫</p>
