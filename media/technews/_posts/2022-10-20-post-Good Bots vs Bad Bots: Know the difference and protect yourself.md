</p>
<p>Even if you‚Äôre not super into technology, you‚Äôve probably heard of the
term ‚Äúbot‚Äù in daily life.</p>
<p>For instance, multi-billionaire Elon Musk has been trying to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62571733" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">wriggle</a>&nbsp;out
of his deal to buy Twitter by claiming that an overly large number of accounts
are run by bots.</p>
<p>Or if you‚Äôre into the daily word game&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wordle</a>,
the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/07/upshot/wordle-bot-introduction.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">WordleBot</a>&nbsp;can
evaluate your completed game and give you a score based on how lucky and
skilful you were.</p>
<p>Bots can be really useful, but with all things tech, they can be used
for nefarious goals as well. Read on to find out more about how bots make
your life easier but can also pose a threat to you.</p>
<h3>So what exactly are bots?</h3>
<p>Bot is short for robot (which in turn brings up images of mechanical androids
on metallic feet), but in the context of our discussion, are software programmes
that are automated to carry out pre-set, repetitive tasks. These programmes
do work that is impractical for humans to do, either because they are exceedingly
mundane and people will get bored before long or because they need to be
done at a speed that humans cannot pull off.</p>
<h3>Bots sound pretty useful to me</h3>
<p>Yes they are! Many digital conveniences we rely on depend on bots.</p>
<p>For example, there are search engine bots ‚Äì also known as web crawlers
or spiders ‚Äì that index websites so that the most relevant results are
shown when you do an internet search. Many companies now deploy chatbots
to answer basic questions of customers who are looking for information
such as their bank account balance or shopping delivery status. Personal
assistant bots like Siri or Alexa are also becoming increasingly common
in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs even possible to make your own programmes to help out with repetitive
tasks using tools such as the Automator app on Macs. Perhaps you need to
change the file names of multiple files or resize many images. Once you
figure out the workflow and key it in, the app does the repetition for
you.</p>
<h3>Sounds great, but I‚Äôm sensing a but‚Ä¶</h3>
<p>Right again! Software can also be made to run automated tasks with malicious
intent. They can flood a website with visits at high speed, causing it
to crash under a denial of service&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">DDoS</a>&nbsp;attack.
Financial crimes can also be committed by using bots to repeatedly login
to a bank‚Äôs website in an attempt to take over customer accounts.</p>
<p>Bots can also be used to send out spam through email and social media.
You may have heard of Elon Musk‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62144776" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">fight</a>&nbsp;with
Twitter over the exact number of bot accounts on the platform.</p>
<h3>Yikes! What can I do to protect myself?</h3>
<p>Bat bot threats typically target businesses and institutions, but individuals
can also fall prey to such attacks. You can take some simple steps to minimise
the chances of becoming a victim.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Don‚Äôt click on suspicious links that come in messages from unknown sources,
be it on social media or through email. These messages could be sent en
masse by bots in the hope that individuals who aren‚Äôt paying attention
will click on them.*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use different passwords on different sites. Recall that bots can quickly
attempt to login on numerous websites using compromised credentials in
a bid to gain access to as many accounts as possible. By using different
passwords, having one set of credentials compromised will not affect the
other accounts.*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignore spam bots. You may receive spam messages and comments from time
to time on social media. Bots may also try to add you to group chats on
chat apps such as Telegram.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Looks like it‚Äôs less about good or bad bots but good or bad human intentions</h3>
<p>Spot on. Technology is ultimately neutral and exists as a tool for humans
to use. It is down to people who turn their bots towards helpful or harmful
pursuits.</p>
<p>In a world without bots, we won‚Äôt have to worry about lots of cybersecurity
threats. But the internet and the digital realm will also be a much poorer
space in such a world.</p>
<p>So be a source of good online. Adopt safe cybersecurity practices and
encourage others to do so. And if you‚Äôre up for it, program a bot to do
some of that photo uploading you‚Äôve been meaning to do for the longest
time!</p>
