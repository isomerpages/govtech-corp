<p>Singapore’s whole-of-government (WOG) approach to problem solving continued
to put the country in good stead, as it garnered three top awards in IDC’s
recent Smart City Asia Pacific Awards 2016.</p>
<p>This was reflected in the three winning projects - a next-generation trade
platform, a smart residential district and an initiative to develop a global
hydrohub.</p>
<p>The Smart City Asia Pacific Awards are based on research firm IDC’s Smart
City Development Index, a benchmarking framework to help smart city planners
analyse the current state of their Smart City initiatives. It incorporates
the views of IDC analysts across the region, the outcome of an online voting
exercise to determine public opinion, and the assessment of an international
advisory council.</p>
<p>Mr Gerald Wang, Head, Asia Pacific Government and Education, IDC, noted
that several submissions and winners this year highlighted the impact of
climate change, heightened global competitiveness, and a growing willingness
to embrace disruptive digital transformation.</p>
<p>One award-winning project from Singapore is the next-generation National
Trade Platform (NTP).</p>
<p>“The National Trade Platform represents a committed effort by the Singapore
Government to continually equip itself with cutting-edge technologies and
streamlined competencies so as to boost its national trade and logistics
industries,” said Mr Wang, who also highlighted the wide participation
of various agencies and private sector stakeholders in this initiative.</p>
<p>The platform, which won in the Economic Development category, builds upon
the success of Singapore’s existing TradeXchange and TradeNet systems to
facilitate more seamless data exchanges across the entire supply chain.</p>
<p>The aim is not only to boost operational efficiency, but also to catalyse
innovation as firms gather new insights from the richer exchange of data.</p>
<p>Mr Ho Chee Pong, Director-General of Singapore Customs, said, “The NTP
goes beyond a technology upgrade of TradeNet and TradeXchange. In building
the NTP, we take into consideration current business needs and emerging
trends in global trade. The platform leverages advances in technology to
help businesses improve productivity in their interactions with government
and business partners.”</p>
<p>The NTP can be seen as one key example of public and private sector co-creation.</p>
<p>Mr Ho added: “This project is also a journey on which the government collaborates
and co-creates with business communities and service providers to build
a vibrant and innovative trade ecosystem. The NTP will help to further
solidify Singapore’s position as a leading global trade hub.”</p>
<h3><strong>From TradeNet to NTP</strong></h3>
<p>A short history lesson: In 1989, Singapore developed TradeNet to enable
companies to apply for trade permits electronically, and obtain approval
within minutes.</p>
<p>Ms Yeo Beng Huay, Chief Information Officer at Singapore Customs, said:
“It contributes greatly to Singapore’s position as a competitive trading
hub. TradeNet processes an average of 9 million permits a year, with total
trade value more than 2 times of Singapore’s GDP.”</p>
<p>The former Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) collaborated
with Singapore Customs to implement TradeXchange in 2007, to help companies
improve data exchange with their supply chain partners.</p>
<p>As of March this year, TradeXchange has brought about economic benefits
to more than 200 companies and enabled companies to achieve more than 7.5
million manhour savings (equivalent to $72.8 million).</p>
<p>Government agencies are now working together to reinvent and transform
TradeNet and TradeXchange in order to create the NTP — thereby preparing
Singapore for the new digital and data economy.</p>
<p>Ms Yeo said, “The NTP is a result of close collaboration between GovTech
and Singapore Customs, with support from partners such as the MOF, MTI,
MAS, MOT, EDB, SPRING, CAAS, MPA and IE Singapore. This is the WOG approach
that we are adopting to serve the needs of the trading community, and to
further boost our supply chain productivity and innovation.”</p>
<p>She added that the NTP will create new economic value by enabling companies
to draw insights through its anonymous and aggregated trade data hub.</p>
<p>It will be an open innovation platform for co-creation: Service providers
can tap on the NTP’s developer sandbox to build value-added services and
applications for companies on the NTP.</p>
<p>Mr Kenneth Lim, Cluster Director, National Development &amp; Transport
Cluster at GovTech, said: “The vision of the NTP is bolder than its predecessors
because it goes beyond just being a Government digital service. Trade and
logistics are cross-border activities, and we look forward to closer collaboration
with global players to enable smarter logistics.”</p>
<p>The project team members are elated by the Award. Mr Lim added: “It really
encourages us, that by working with the logistics &amp; trade companies
in the ecosystem, we are moving together in the right direction. We hope
that the NTP can be Singapore’s contribution to the global trade and logistics
ecosystem, and enable Singapore to continue to thrive as a value-adding
logistics hub in the world.”</p>
<h3><strong>Smart Buildings and Hydrohub</strong></h3>
<p>Two other Singapore projects won awards from IDC.</p>
<p>In the category of Smart Buildings – one of 14 functional smart city domains
covered by the index – Singapore’s Smart Yuhua Residential Estate project
was lauded for its plan to incorporate “smart living” into an existing
public housing estate.</p>
<p>Solutions that are being introduced to transform Yuhua into a smart and
sustainable estate include elderly monitoring systems, home energy and
water management systems, a smart pneumatic waste conveyance system, smart
electrical sub-meters and remote water meters, and a smart solar energy
monitoring system.</p>
<p>In the public voting phase, the project stood out against other initiatives
such as the Korea Micro Energy Grid Pilot Initiative for Public Buildings
in Sejong Metropolitan Autonomous City in South Korea and the Smart Urban
Housing Communities initiative for Taipei City, Taiwan.</p>
<p>Singapore’s plan to develop itself into a Global Hydrohub, which took
top honours in the Smart Water category, pushes the envelope in its efforts
to build up a sustainable supply of water to ensure resilience in the face
of variable weather and growing demand for water.</p>
