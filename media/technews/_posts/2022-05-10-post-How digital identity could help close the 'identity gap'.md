<p>For those without documents, the world is cut off.</p>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong>&nbsp;Nearly one billion people around the
world have no official proof of identity.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong>&nbsp;Without ID, people cannot access
key public or private services - they are excluded from society and the
digital economy.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong>&nbsp;Digital ID could play a role in tackling
this issue.</p>
<p>It might seem premature to talk about digital ID, given that delivering
traditional and physical ID remains a challenge in many parts of the world.
But digital ID could play an important role in providing, by 2030, a legal
form of ID to those currently without one – a target set by the Sustainable
Development Goals. Currently, almost one billion people around the world
lack legal and verifiable identity documents.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has starkly highlighted the role of digital and
digitalisation in our everyday lives. Digital ID is a key foundation and
catalyst for each of these elements – from accessing public services and
healthcare, to receiving government payments, and even using online products
and services from the private sector. Without ID, individuals can be excluded
from public services, the digital economy, and even wider society. Digital
ID is, therefore, a key part of lives and livelihoods.</p>
<h3>What is Digital ID?</h3>
<p>‘Digital ID’ encompasses both a physical or digital identity artefact
associated with an individual but also the underlying process of ensuring
that the artefact is credible – and is recognised and trusted in the society
and economy. Digital IDs can have different purposes – from ‘functional’
IDs to access particular services or privileges (such as driver’s licenses)
to ‘foundational’ IDs that are authoritative proof of a person’s identity.
For example, a passport or national ID card.</p>
<p>Digital ID therefore provides the process and structure to verify an individual’s
identity in order to allow access to products and services. It is a key
foundation and enabler of the digital economy. For example, over 3.5 million
users of Singapore’s ‘Singpass’ app transact with over 700 government agencies
and private sector organisations across more than 2,000 services. With
about 350 million personal and corporate Singpass transactions in a year,
Singpass is one of the most widely adopted national digital identity systems
in the world.</p>
<h3>Shaping a digital ID</h3>
<p>Many countries have developed, or are exploring, national ID systems –
and broader ‘civil registration and vital statistics’ initiatives. From
birth certification to physical or digital ID cards, governments recognise
the importance of a unique identifier for public – and other – service
delivery. Around the world, digital is also playing a role – from driving
a transition from paper or plastic ID cards, to defining smart cards (with
some online or digital capabilities), to delivering completely digital
offerings with no physical counterpart.</p>
<p>Singapore’s digital ID journey is particularly exciting, as the country
did not follow the above journey – but jumped from purely physical ID cards
straight to a full-fledged digital product. How did the country do this?
And what insights can other countries apply in their work?</p>
<p><strong>Prioritise co-design:</strong>&nbsp;Digital ID solutions must
be inclusive by design to ensure that no one is excluded from the access
they enable. Achieving this requires engagement and co-design with citizens.
This could include addressing priorities around digital literacy, safety,
and security. As part of this, implementers, designers, and administrators
will also need to simplify the user-experience by reducing complexity,
duplication, and legacy systems and processes. This collaboration is important,
as it is a key driver of trust – an essential asset when the digital economy
also includes risks of fraud and other dangers. Building robust, secure,
and useful digital ID solutions, founded on citizen needs, is an important
step in shaping this citizen confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Build on existing foundations:</strong>&nbsp;Any digital ID solution
will need to align with existing channels of public service delivery, and
integrate into government digital components. This can be complicated when
building on top of legacy technology, but also in the context of incomplete
or non-existent analogue identity systems. Leveraging high-trust services
or institutions as an ‘exemplar’ can be useful. Singapore’s National Digital
Identity journey can be traced to the implementation of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-identity/singpass/overview.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singpass</a>&nbsp;–
a foundational digital infrastructure. In extending Singpass to service
both public and private sectors, this robust foundation enabled a range
of innovative solutions that facilitate transactions for citizens and businesses
in a secure and smooth manner.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on data quality:</strong>&nbsp;Any form of ID can only be
as good as its underlying data. Ensuring a ‘single source of truth’, to
guarantee the authenticity of this foundational data, is a crucial part
of the digital ID system. Countries have developed canonical data registries
– ensuring that all data is genuine, unique, and also able to integrate
with databases within and beyond the public sector.</p>
<p>In Singapore’s case, these include (i)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-identity/myinfo/overview.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Myinfo</a>&nbsp;–
a “Tell Us Once” service that enables citizens or businesses to pre-fill
and provide data for online transactions across industries; and (ii)&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-identity/sgfindex/overview.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SGFinDex</a>&nbsp;– a centrally managed consent system that allows individuals
to access financial information held across financial institutions such
as banks, insurers, and government agencies. Data quality also needs to
be futureproofed by building reliable and sustainable digital architectures
and workflows – particularly in ensuring the uptake and adoption of a digital
ID and its associated services.</p>
<p><strong>Shape a digital ecosystem:</strong>&nbsp;The usefulness and sustainability
of digital ID cannot be achieved by the government alone. The private sector
plays a particularly important role. Digital ID needs to be embedded in
service delivery – both public and private – to become useful to citizens,
and to catalyse a broader digital economy. Besides demonstrating clear
value to the user, constant learning and refinement are needed to keep
a digital ID useful and essential in a fast-moving digital economy. A meaningful
digital economy transcends boundaries (country borders or organisational),
and this requires effort to develop interoperability with other aspiring
digital nations, and collaboration with the tech community.</p>
<p>Regarding interoperability with like-minded countries, Singapore has entered
into Digital Identity MOUs with countries such as Australia, the United
Kingdom and China (Shenzhen) to explore cross-border recognition. Singapore
is also focused on mutual learning through international engagement by
hosting an annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/corporate-publications/digital-government-exchange-reports" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">G2G DGX Digital Identity Working group</a>,
and tech community outreach initiatives such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/communities/stack-x-meetups/overview.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STACK-X Meetup.</a>
</p>
<h3>Start building now</h3>
<p>Shaping a digital ID is a marathon, and not a sprint. It must be founded
on local needs and realities, but governments should also look to learn
from others. This collaboration will also extend to delivery, with governments
now needing to explore digital ID solutions that function beyond national
borders. In a global digital economy, founded on cross-border data flows,
broader digital ID offerings are going to be important. Countries like
Singapore and Estonia are already exploring the potential of shaping these
internationally interoperable digital ID initiatives.</p>
<p>Governments play a leading role in building and shaping these national
and international – and robust and catalytic - digital ID systems. Citizens
and businesses are important partners, but the legal authority rests with
the government. This demands extraordinary efforts – from building an inclusive
digital infrastructure, to ensuring digital and broader literacy to ensure
that all can benefit from the potential afforded by digital ID initiatives.
These efforts are essential, particularly recognising the crucial role
of digital ID in enabling successful and prosperous lives and livelihoods
around the world.</p>
