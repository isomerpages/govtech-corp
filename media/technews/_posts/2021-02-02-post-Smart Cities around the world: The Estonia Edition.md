<p>Despite being a small European nation with 1.3 million citizens, Estonia
punches above its weight when it comes to digital adoption and is often
lauded as one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world.</p>

<p><em>Let's find out how Estonia started on their smart city journey! PHOTO: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/how-estonia-became-a-digital-society.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UNSPLASH.COM</a></em>
</p>
<p>The country made the news in 2020 when it launched its Digital Nomad visa
in August ‚Äî the first of its kind ‚Äî allowing foreigners to live within
its borders for up to a year, all while working for an employer in another
country. This is just one example of Estonia‚Äôs avid and early adoption
of tech-related initiatives.</p>
<p>Because Estonia has so warmly embraced technology, it naturally has fascinating
smart city initiatives and projects that are worth a closer look.</p>
<h3>eID and Digital Services</h3>
<p>When Estonia gained independence in 1991 from the Soviet Union, the government
had to build up its public services from scratch, and from the start, it
decided to go digital.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEstonia was a relatively poor country,‚Äù Estonia‚Äôs President Kersti Kaljulaid
said during a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/how-estonia-became-a-digital-society.html" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CNBC interview.</a>&nbsp;‚ÄúOur
public sector, our government and our civil servants wanted to offer our
people good quality services. We did it straight away digitally because
it was simply cheaper, easy.‚Äù</p>
<p>Today, over 99% of Estonia‚Äôs government services can be done online, from
paying taxes to checking health records and prescriptions to even e-voting!</p>
<p>However, the backbone of the system is Estonia‚Äôs digital ID service ‚Äî
aptly named eID ‚Äî which allows citizens to identify themselves when making
online transactions. In fact, enabling digital signatures has allowed the
country to save up to 2% of its GDP annually.</p>
<p>Estonia‚Äôs eID system is similar to Singapore‚Äôs very own&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/common/aboutus" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singpass</a>,
which also allows Singapore residents to digitally verify their identities.
This grants users access to over 2,000 online services from government
and private organisations. With SingPass, one can instantly check their
CPF account balances or even apply for a home online.</p>
<p>However, there are some key differences between the two systems. For example,
usage of the mobile version of eID requires an individual to own a specially-registered
SIM card that is secured with a passcode. While in Singapore, we use the
SingPass Mobile app, that‚Äôs secured with either a fingerprint, face recognition
or a 6-digit pin.</p>
<p>Either way, Estonians and Singaporeans can both agree that digital identification
that facilitates e-transactions goes a long way to making our lives much,
much easier.</p>
<h3>Mobile Parking Payments</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p><em>Estonians have been paying for parking via mobile for 20 years!</em>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/how-estonia-became-a-digital-society.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parking.SG</a>,
launched in 2017, allows Singaporean motorists to pay and manage their
parking sessions via a mobile app. Gone are the days of hunting down a
7-11 to buy paper parking coupons or the fear of finding a fine plastered
on the windscreen after returning from a longer-than-expected makan session.</p>
<p>But did you know that Estonia was the first country in the world to implement
a mobile parking payment system? Estonians have been enjoying mobile parking
payments since 2000.</p>
<p>The aptly named&nbsp;<a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/location-based-services/mobile-parking/#:~:text=Mobile%20Parking%20is%20a%20convenient,phone%20does%20everything%20for%20you." class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mobile Parking system</a>&nbsp;can
be used in public parking facilities and even private ones. It‚Äôs all done
conveniently through a mobile app. Around 90% of all parking charges are
paid via the system.</p>
<p>Recent improvements to the Mobile Parking app include a fully automated
solution; a parking session automatically begins when the vehicle is turned
off and ends once it's started up again. This is achieved when the app
is paired via Bluetooth to a vehicle‚Äôs in-car entertainment system.</p>
<p>Even payment is simple, as the cost of the parking will be simply added
to the driver‚Äôs mobile phone bill at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Smart Zebra Crossing</h3>
<p>When we talk about smart cities, vehicle-related solutions dominate the
headlines, from electric self-driving cars to the above mentioned smart
parking system. But what about smart city solutions for the most basic
commuter ‚Äî the walking pedestrian?</p>
<p>Well, how about a smart zebra crossing sign? Developed by the Estonian
company Bercman, this smart sign has been installed in four locations.
Three operate in Estonia, and one operates in Helsinki, Finland.</p>
<p>But what is it? Well, named the Smart Pedestrian Crosswalk (of course)
is a street-sign on steroids. While traditional signages passively provide
information to road users and pedestrians to keep them safe, this smart
sign is able to take active steps to prevent accidents from occurring.</p>
<p><a href="https://amsterdamsmartcity.com/international-projects/smart-flow" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Smart Pedestrian Crosswalk</a>,
an IoT cloud-based platform, monitors sensors to report traffic flow and
parking availability across Amsterdam. When Smart Flow was first launched,
the average time required to find a parking space was significantly reduced
by 43 per cent. On top of that, it helps drivers to make more fiscally
responsible choices by listing the cheapest options within the area.</p>
<p>How is this done? According to Bercman: ‚Äú‚Ä¶narrow artificial intelligence
algorithms are used, which are capable of predicting the moving trajectories
when a pedestrian might be run over by a vehicle‚Äù. The sign would then
emit audio warnings and flash red LEDs to grab the attention of both pedestrians
and drivers to prevent an accident.</p>
<p>Now that‚Äôs really smart.</p>
<h3>A Smart Commitment</h3>
<p>In 2019, the Estonian government co-funded ‚Ç¨17 million into a fund that
focuses on developing solutions for cross-border integration of smart cities.
The project dubbed the ‚ÄúFinest Twins‚Äù, aims to make the neighbouring capital
cities of Finland and Estonia ‚Äî Helsinki and Tallinn ‚Äî more digitally integrated.</p>
<p>Additionally, the initiative will fund a challenge that seeks to award
10 proposals that solve urban challenges identified by the local governments
of Estonia. Each successful proposal would receive up to ‚Ç¨1.5 million each
to fund a large-scale pilot test.</p>
<p>The fund is the most valuable research and development fund in Estonia,
and signifies the commitment Estonians have made towards the smart city
dream. As such, we can be sure to expect further exciting smart city developments
from Estonia.</p>
