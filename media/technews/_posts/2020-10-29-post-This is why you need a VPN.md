<h3>Here‚Äôs why we think VPN (Virtual Private Network) is an ‚Äúessential service‚Äù</h3>
<p>Even as Singapore progressively reopens its economy, many of us continue
to work from home today. Such arrangements are essential to cut down unnecessary
travel and interaction to keep Covid-19 at bay.</p>

<p><em>A VPN brings about several benefits, read on to find out more! PHOTO: <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/guard-against-common-cyber-attacks-while-working-home" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UNSPLASH.com</a></em>
</p>
<p>But even as you stay physically safe in your home office, you may be unwittingly
exposing yourself and your organisational network to viruses and contamination
of a digital nature instead.</p>
<p>While working from home has compelled businesses to accelerate their digital
transformations, bad actors have also seen this as a ‚Äúgreat opportunity‚Äù
to target home networks that typically aren‚Äôt as secure as corporate ones.</p>
<p>According to this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/guard-against-common-cyber-attacks-while-working-home" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">commentary</a>&nbsp;by
a cyber security specialist, more than 2,000 malicious domain names containing
pandemic-related words like ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù were registered in the first three
months of 2020. In March, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/leehsienloong/photos/a.344710778924968/3154441464618538/?type=3" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">phishing scam</a>&nbsp;sent
emails purportedly from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to lure unsuspecting
individuals to respond.</p>
<p>And while accessing company information through the internet, your communication
‚Äì which travels to and from your computer ‚Äì could be intercepted somewhere
along the round trip by hackers who want to see what you‚Äôre up to.</p>
<p>To protect against such attacks, you can use a Virtual Private Network,
better known as VPN.</p>
<h3>What is a VPN, and how does it work?</h3>
<p>Now, disregard your stereotypes about what people use VPNs for. There
are totally legitimate reasons for using a VPN, and working from home securely
is one of them!</p>
<p>When you connect to the internet through a VPN, all the traffic from your
computer is first encrypted and routed to a VPN server, protecting it from
prying eyes. Both incoming and outgoing information flows through the VPN
server first ‚Äì completely hidden from your internet service provider, or
your network administrator!</p>
<p>For that reason, many organisations, especially those dealing with sensitive
information, have long made VPN mandatory for remote access.</p>

<h3>Wait, so the VPN knows what I‚Äôm up to?</h3>
<p>In a word, yes. This is why it‚Äôs imperative that you use a trustworthy
one and not sign up for some fly-by-night service just because it‚Äôs free.</p>
<h3>OK, so what should I look out for?</h3>
<p>Just like almost any product, online reviews for ‚Äúthe best VPN service‚Äù
are readily available. When it comes to ‚ÄúWhich VPN?‚Äù there are several
factors to consider:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Data privacy This is a big one because there‚Äôs no point trying to be safe
and secure if the gatekeeper is hawking your activity log to the highest
bidder. This is not to say that all free VPN services are dodgy, but it‚Äôs
a good idea to understand how the provider is keeping the lights on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security Many VPNs tout their excellent security measures, but reputable
providers publish security reports conducted by independent auditors. This
is an added layer of checks to ensure the metaphorical vault is sealed
tight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed The extra steps taken in filtering traffic through the VPN server
will slow down your internet connection, so make sure to choose a service
that can still deliver a speedy online experience. Security doesn‚Äôt have
to come at the expense of productivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Another VPN use: securing public wifi</h3>
<p>VPN also comes in handy when you are connecting to a public wifi network.
Few of us can resist connecting to free public wifi ‚Äì say while hanging
out at a cafe ‚Äì especially when overseas (unimaginable now, but the day
will eventually come). Unfortunately, your internet traffic ‚Äì along with
your passwords, account numbers, and other private information ‚Äì are particularly
vulnerable on public wifi as hackers can casually connect to these networks,
steal your data and use them for a wide range of cybercrimes ‚Äì including
phishing, malware attacks, and yes, the classic ‚Äòwithdraw large amounts
of money from your bank accounts‚Äô.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, a VPN protects you by providing an encrypted pipeline
starting from your device and running through the public wifi network all
the way to the VPN server. Yes, VPN can be used for mobile devices as well
through the app of a VPN provider.</p>
<h3>Just one aspect among many</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, a VPN is just one of a few steps you can take to
secure your online life. For example, it‚Äôs more important to enable two-factor
authentication and use a password manager to store all your strong, unique
passwords for different services (no, adding a different number behind
the same password doesn‚Äôt count).</p>
<p>Analogy time! If you want to be healthy, it‚Äôs silly to slog for hours
at the gym yet chain smoke and eat char kway teow every day.</p>
<p>So yes, let‚Äôs continue to stay safe by working from home, but also ensure
that we‚Äôre working safely while at home.</p>
