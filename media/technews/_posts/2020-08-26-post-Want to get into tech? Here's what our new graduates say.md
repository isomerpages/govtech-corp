<p>These days, people really want to get into the thriving tech sector.</p>
<p>Students are dreaming about being software engineers. Mid-career switchers
are attending boot camps in an attempt to get up to speed. For those of
us who don‚Äôt have the luxury of time and background in the topic, it can
be daunting to get started.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we spoke to two GovTech engineers ‚Äì new to the workforce,
no less ‚Äì to tell us how one can get started on learning about tech and
what it‚Äôs like to start a career in tech right now.</p>

<h4>Q: Hey there! As you know, money can be tight for young graduates entering the workforce. What are some places where we can learn tech skills for free?</h4>
<p>If you intend to be a UI/UX designer for a digital product, a basic understanding
of HTML/CSS/Javascript will enable you to better understand and communicate
your designs with the developers. One of the places I started out learning
front-end programming languages was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Code Academy</a>.
It‚Äôs a great resource for anyone who wants to start out with front-end
development. The site is immensely beneficial for newbies who wish to learn
from scratch as it guides you through chapters and progressively builds
on what you have learnt as compared to passively reading about it.</p>
<p>That really helps, considering programming is an applied skill!</p>
<p>If you are interested in UX, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coursera.org/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Coursera</a>&nbsp;for
many free course materials on UX and more. It will be a great stepping
stone into the theoretical aspects of UX.</p>
<p>When the foundations are laid, don‚Äôt forget to put what you have learnt
into practice! As an aspiring UX designer, it would really help to build
up your own portfolio of side projects. You can find something that you‚Äôre
passionate to create or design. If you don‚Äôt have that, find something
about a current app, product or service that frustrates you and challenge
yourself to apply what you‚Äôve learnt to make the existing UX better.</p>
<h4>Q: What other skills are important for anybody who wants to be a UX designer?</h4>
<p>To be a good UX designer, having strong interpersonal and communication
skills are extremely important, since it‚Äôs about understanding people and
being understood without always having something tangible. You will need
these skills to help put across your ideas and to persuade others why your
suggested ideas should be adopted.</p>

<h4>Q: Many employers are looking and hiring programmers these days. Why do you think so?</h4>
<p>The world is entering a new era of digital age. Everything you see and
do involves software in some way or the other. Some examples: When you
turn on your tap, a software down the water supply system pipeline is ensuring
there is enough clean water distributed to every household. Traffic light
systems? They‚Äôre built upon complex algorithms to ensure efficient distribution
of traffic.</p>
<p>If you can program things, the power is in your hands ‚Äì and as seen from
the examples above, the impact of your work is no longer restricted to
the digital realm. I think it holds the key to solve some of the greatest
challenges in global society today.</p>
<h4>Q: A lot of people think programming has a lot to do with code and sitting in front of a computer. Is that the full picture?</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs not entirely true! Learning to program also helps to develop your
frame of thought! A term that is usually associated with the way programmers
think and tackle problems methodologically is called ‚Äúcomputational thinking‚Äù.
Developing ‚Äúcomputational thinking‚Äù habits help you deal with real-world
problems in general, not just being good with computers!</p>
<p>Through ‚Äúcomputational thinking‚Äù, you learn to break down huge complex
problems into smaller and more manageable parts. You will recognise patterns
and develop step-by-step solutions (algorithms). This is very useful skill
to have! Thus, a programmer is often associated with traits like ‚Äúanalytical‚Äù,
‚Äúlogical‚Äù and ‚Äúproblem solver‚Äù!</p>
<h4>Q: You do cybersecurity, which is not a very common field. Make a career pitch for it:</h4>
<p>Our digital footprints that we leave behind in cyberspace, are the new
‚Äúgold‚Äù of the 21st century.</p>
<p>These digital footprints can be pieced together to perform malicious acts
against individuals or organisations by cybercriminals. They make use of
the information we leave behind to further their malicious intent. For
example, they can use publicly available information that is personal to
us to craft a believable pretext for phishing emails.</p>
<p>Given the dynamics of the cyber landscape, attacks are becoming increasingly
sophisticated and prevalent. The industries are beginning to see the need
for increased but sustainable cybersecurity investments, and this has led
to the demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals.</p>
<p>Learning cybersecurity is not just about safeguarding the organisation
but also people we hold dear. It‚Äôs a career that is both future-proof and
meaningful. What‚Äôs there not to like?</p>
<h4>Q: What are some free learning resources you‚Äôll recommend?</h4>
