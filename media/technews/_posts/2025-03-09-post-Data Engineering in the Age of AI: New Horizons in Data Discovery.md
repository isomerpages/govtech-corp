<p>In the age of big data, more data is supposed to mean better, data-driven
decisions. With vast amounts of information at our fingertips, government
agencies and businesses alike should be empowered to make smarter, faster,
and more informed choices. But sometimes, the abundance of data isn’t just
empowering; it’s overwhelming.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When that happens, finding the right data among endless repositories can
feel like chasing shadows. For data engineers and analysts, the challenge
is not just about having enough data, but about finding the right data
quickly and efficiently. To tackle this issue, GovTech’s <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/our-capabilities/data-engineering/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Data Engineering Practice team</a> is
using <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/our-digital-government-efforts/ai-and-data-driven-government/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to
rethink the way we approach data discovery.</p>
<h3>Playing hide and seek with data</h3>
<p>Playing hide and seek at the void deck as kids is all fun and games. But
when data plays hide and seek, the fun quickly disappears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For data professionals, “seeking” often means sifting through countless
databases and metadata, trying to locate the exact piece of information
needed. This process is not only labour-intensive and time-consuming but
also inherently complex. It heavily relies on keyword searches, where users
must guess the right terms or pre-defined tags. If you don’t know the exact
keyword, good luck finding that elusive data set. This often leads to information
overload, where users are swamped by too much metadata and struggle to
identify what's truly relevant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For agencies like the <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ministry of Manpower (MOM)</a>, which handles
between 900 and 1,000 external data requests from other government agencies
each year, this aforementioned poses a challenge. Scaling data discovery
to meet growing demands requires innovation that can break through current
bottlenecks.</p>
<h3>AI for data engineering</h3>
<p>Recognising these challenges, the Data Engineering Practice (DP) team
introduced a powerful ally – artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>By embracing AI-driven data engineering, the team set out to automate
and optimise key aspects of the data pipeline, particularly in data discovery.
The goal was simple yet ambitious: make finding the right data as intuitive
as possible, while reducing the heavy lifting traditionally required from
human users.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>The DP team focused on two core innovations to enhance data discovery:</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Embedding search: </strong>This technique goes beyond simple keyword
searches and uses natural language processing to help users find relevant
data based on context and meaning instead of exact matches. It means that
users no longer need to guess the right keywords. Instead, they can use
natural language queries, and the system will understand the intent, surfacing
the most relevant data elements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Graph search: </strong>Datasets don't exist in isolation, they
are interconnected with each other. Graph search allows users to explore
and visualise the relationships between different data elements. It’s like
drawing a map of your data to show how one dataset links to another, revealing
deeper insights and connections that might have otherwise been missed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Besides enabling smarter searches, AI also allowed the DP team to offload
repetitive, resource-heavy tasks to machines. These tireless algorithms
could iterate through vast amounts of metadata, continually enriching it
and refining search results. Over time, the system gets better at surfacing
the most relevant data, moving towards a globally optimal solution for
data discovery.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With machines handling the grunt work, human users can now focus on higher-level
tasks — interpreting results, validating insights, and applying their expertise
to solve complex problems.</p>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>To make smart discovery data engineering a reality, the Data Engineering
Practice team worked over three months to develop a prototype for MOM.</p>
<p>Rather than sticking to existing methods like the single-retrieval vector-based
<a href="https://go.gov.sg/ragplaybook" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</a>approach, the team pushed boundaries.
They introduced a more efficient, flexible, and comprehensive system known
as the Multi-Retrieval Agentic Graph-based RAG Approach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of its unique features include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Metadata Knowledge Graph: </strong>To uncover deeper relationships
between data elements, the team built a comprehensive knowledge graph.
Users can discover, organise, and interact with metadata more intuitively,
making complex data ecosystems easier to navigate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated metadata enrichment: </strong>Preparing detailed metadata
descriptions can be a tedious task. By using AI to automate this process,
metadata is continually updated without requiring hours of manual work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agentic retrieval: </strong>The team also introduced autonomous
agents that can make independent decisions and work together with humans
to solve problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Natural language queries: </strong>This feature enables users
to simply type in questions or requests in plain English, significantly
boosting user-friendliness and lowering the barrier to entry for non-technical
users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>No more hide and seek</h3>
<p>MOM officers now have a powerful new assistant in their data discovery
toolkit. What was once a complex, time-consuming process has become faster,
smarter, and more intuitive.</p>
<p>The prototype not only streamlines data discovery but also empowers MOM
to manage, utilise, and govern data more effectively. With improved discoverability
and understanding of high-quality data, officers can make better-informed
decisions that drive meaningful outcomes for Singaporeans, foreign employees
and businesses.</p>

<h3>More innovations to come</h3>
<p>As big data gets ever bigger, the game of data hide and seek will only
grow more complex. The Data Engineering Practice team will continue to
push the boundaries of what’s possible with AI, giving seekers the tools
they need to win, and win faster.</p>
