<p><em>Recipients of GovTech-Smart Nation Scholarship (SNS) 2021</em>
</p>
<h3>Tell us a bit more about you! Where are you studying right now and what sparked you to take up your course of study?</h3>
<p><strong>Jiacheng:</strong>&nbsp;I am currently studying Computer Science
at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Studying Computer Science
has always been at the back of my mind, having thoroughly enjoyed my time
in Robotics during secondary school!</p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong>&nbsp;I am also at NUS, pursuing a Double Degree
Programme in Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering and Economics, which
would provide me with a joint education in the engineering design process
and economic theoretical frameworks, allowing me to progress to a Full-Stack
Data Engineer.</p>
<p><strong>Xinyi:</strong>&nbsp;As for me, I am studying Mathematics at the
University of Cambridge. I believe that mathematical thinking gives me
a sturdy foundation for programming and allows me to hone critical thinking
and problem-solving capabilities, which are important attributes in the
ever-changing technological landscape.</p>
<h3>What drew you to the tech industry?</h3>
<p><strong>Jiacheng:</strong>&nbsp;I had a fun time at the Computer Science
Summer Institute (CSSIx) camp, where I got to create and set up a website
with my teammates. The process of building a website was an empowering
experience as I realised that I could do more to serve purpose and meaning
for the public.</p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong>&nbsp;That‚Äôs interesting, Jia Cheng. For me, it
was during one of my first-year modules where I was exposed to computer
science and its relation to my passion for puzzle-solving. They gave us
a problem; we wrote the code that made sense to us to solve it. Later,
I took an internship and even signed up for an external course on data
analytics, which crystallised my decision to pursue data analytics as a
career.</p>
<p><strong>Xinyi:</strong>&nbsp;I‚Äôve always held on to the belief that technology
is the catalyst for progress and will continue to be in the future as well.
The presence of the unknown, unsolved, unexplored‚Ä¶ are the reasons I want
to work in technology. Making use of modern technology creatively so that
it moves beyond academic consideration and into real-world applications
and benefits is something I believe is meaningful.</p>
<h3>Why did you choose to apply for SNS and was choosing GovTech an obvious choice?</h3>
<p><strong>Jiacheng:</strong>&nbsp;I always knew I wanted to apply for a
scholarship as it would give me great exposure, and the Smart Nation Scholarship
was especially appealing to me. GovTech is the clear choice for me, given
my area of study, and I was also drawn to GovTech‚Äôs open work culture and
the sense of purpose in developing tech products to help improve people‚Äôs
day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>I also liked the fact that GovTech is designing intuitive and easy-to-use
tech. The changes in some government apps which I have used for some time
had me thinking ‚ÄúWow, it‚Äôs so much easier and more enjoyable to use now‚Äù
and, very naturally, the next thought I had was ‚ÄúI want to be a part of
making that change happening too‚Äù. Additionally, the variety of projects
at GovTech is very appealing to me as I like change and thrive in a dynamic
environment.</p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong>&nbsp;GovTech is the perfect fit for me as my dream
job is an intersection of Infocomm technologies and creating social impact.
I envision a more digitally connected world, which is in line with Singapore‚Äôs
Smart Nation plans. Together with my interest in Data Analytics, it led
me to explore the Smart Nation Scholarship, through which I can combine
my interest in using tech to create sustainable solutions to social issues.</p>
<p><strong>Xinyi:</strong>&nbsp;The first time I heard of GovTech was while
reading a blog post detailing how their data scientists found the Circle
Line rogue train. The step-by-step unravelling of the whodunit had me hooked.
Finding the answer with data, purging the plague upon so many Singaporean
commuters, was a fitting example of technology in public service.</p>
<p>Meaning is important in a career, and GovTech would allow me to employ
technology to solve problems or make lives easier for more people. The
agile way in which GovTech responded to the pandemic also showed its importance
as an impactful, innovative agency.</p>
<h3>How was your interview experience at GovTech like?</h3>
<p><strong>Jiacheng:</strong>&nbsp;I found the interview interesting and
insightful because as I learnt more about GovTech and myself, through the
various interview questions.</p>
<p>Also, the GeekInsider assessment event was exciting and fun because I
really liked the discussion-based activity where I had the opportunity
to learn different technology applications from my fellow interviewees.
I also enjoyed the coding challenge (although I was not able to pass several
of the test cases) because it really challenged me to think about creative
ways to come up with a solution to the problem statement.</p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong>&nbsp;Though it was nerve-wrecking at the final
stage of the interview, I would say that the interview experience with
GovTech was highly enriching and a fulfilling process.</p>
<p>I still vividly recall entering the Zoom link and being pleasantly surprised
by the diversity in backgrounds of my teammates ‚Äì I was not the only girl
present!</p>
<p>The activities were exciting and stimulating. For instance, the virtual
escape room with my teammates, where we were able to work together to solve
the puzzles without breaking much of a sweat. When we emerged first place,
it felt like an affirmation of our efforts, and this was the most memorable
part of my interview journey.</p>
<p>I would also like to take this chance to thank Perrin and Cherine from
GovTech for taking the time out of their busy schedules to help me prepare
for the Talent Leadership Assessment Board interview.</p>
<p><strong>Xinyi:</strong>&nbsp;I would say that the interview experience
was positive, as my interviewers were friendly, and their sharing felt
tangible and authentic.</p>
<p>Like Jia Cheng, the GeekInsider event was the highlight for me as well,
as I had the opportunity to work with others on solving puzzles! The GovTechies
were also supportive throughout the interview process, giving us honest
feedback for our personal development and I really liked that we were provided
with the entire schedule ahead of time to know what to expect. Overall,
it felt like a learning process for me instead of a daunting interview
process.</p>
<h3>What do you hope to achieve in the Smart Nation Scholarship?</h3>
<p><strong>Jiacheng:</strong>&nbsp;I hope that through the scholarship programme,
I can contribute back to Singapore by developing people-centric tech products
and be part of the ones driving change.</p>
<p><strong>Anna:</strong>&nbsp;Similar to Jiacheng, I hope to build a career
in using data to drive transformational change in the everyday lives of
people in Singapore. I am also looking forward to the networking and mentorship
opportunities, and my work at GovTech upon graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Xinyi:</strong>&nbsp;As for me I am excited to step into a novel,
fast-developing field, where my creations could be put to the test to solve
problems that Singapore faces, helping to keep Singapore‚Äôs competitive
edge amid constantly evolving technologies.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope to improve Singaporeans‚Äô lives, to equip us with more
advanced and secure digital technologies and keep the public sector safe
and efficient.</p>
