<p>Singapore is home to one of the fastest ageing populations in the world.
The government thus hopes to keep its senior citizens engaged in their
silver years via the Moments of Life mobile app.</p>
<p>In June 2018, the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech)
launched the <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/moments-of-life/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Moments of Life mobile app</a> catering
to the needs of young parents—the first example of a citizen-centric concierge-like
approach to the provision of government digital services. Rather than seek
out multiple ministries to register a new birth and apply for a baby bonus,
young parents can now complete all these tasks on a single platform using
a mobile device.</p>
<p>In this way, multiple touchpoints between citizens and the government
are unified into a seamless and coherent service journey. This same approach
is now being taken to cater to the unique requirements of another citizen
demographic further downstream in the continuum of life—senior citizens.</p>
<p>Singapore is experiencing an ageing population, and by the year 2030,
some 900,000 Singaporeans will be over the age of 65. Seeking to better
serve this growing segment of society, GovTech is enhancing the Moments
of Life mobile app with an Active Ageing module in September 2019.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)
approached us [at GovTech] to create a mobile app for citizens over 60
years old, which include those eligible for the recently launched Merdeka
Generation Package,” said Mr Simon Ang, assistant director at GovTech.</p>

<h3><strong>All activities at a glance</strong></h3>
<p>An important part of active ageing is keeping senior citizens involved
and engaged in the community. To this end, the Health Promotion Board (HPB)
and the People’s Association (PA) frequently organise events, courses and
workshops catering to the elderly in Singapore. However, there is no single
portal that integrates information from different agencies. Hence the suggestion
to build a one-stop mobile-friendly platform for event listings that cater
to seniors in Singapore. “Rather than create a separate mobile app to host
these functions, we advised MOH and AIC to leverage existing digital infrastructure
created for the Moments of Life app,” Mr Ang explained.</p>
<p>Now, when seniors log in to the MOL app, they can easily navigate a page
that displays details about the various activities relevant to them.</p>
<h3><strong>Honouring the Merdeka Generation</strong></h3>
<p>Another critical function of the Moments of Life Active Ageing module
is an embedded Merdeka Generation (MG) e-card. The Merdeka Generation Package
(MGP) supports MG seniors’ aspirations to stay active and healthy. With
this new module, MG seniors can show their MG e-card to receive subsidies
at the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GP and dental clinics, and
discounts at participating merchant outlets.</p>
<p>When building this functionality, the GovTech team ran into the challenge
of identifying citizens who received the MGP. As the team anticipated appeals
for MGP, it was crucial to have a database that was updated in real-time
to reflect successful appeals.</p>
<p>“In the end, we found that the ‘single source of truth’ suitable for our
use lay with the Central Provident Fund (CPF),” said Mr Ang, crediting
his colleagues at CPF for expediting their data uplink to the Moments of
Life platform.</p>
<h3><strong>An ear to the ground</strong></h3>
<p>After overcoming the dataset issues, the GovTech team next had to contend
with the need for multiple language options in the MOL app; many seniors
prefer conversing in vernacular languages.</p>
<p>“We reached out to our partners for translation capabilities, and our
colleagues at Singapore Press Holdings were crucial in helping to make
the app more accessible to seniors,” said Mr Ang. With these elements in
place, a prototype of the Moments of Life Active Ageing module was completed
in March 2019 and was ready to move into the next phase: user testing.</p>
<p>User testing is a critical stage for any product, said Mr Ang, as it surfaces
issues that may not have been uncovered during the development stage Some
400 seniors were consulted throughout the process of developing the app,
from in-depth UI testing during the prototyping phases, to testing the
live version of the product.</p>
<p>In addition to feedback on font sizes, seniors also preferred the use
of symbols and icons for intuitive navigation of the app’s features. Many
of the users also requested for CHAS benefits to be accessible via the
app.</p>
<h3><strong>Inclusion and ambition</strong></h3>
<p>With these insights, the GovTech team iterated on their product, and between
June and September 2019, conducted alpha- and beta-testing for further
refinement.</p>
<p>The GovTech team is also looking at expanding the Moments of Life app’s
range of functions. “For example, we found that there are seniors who want
to look for short-term employment, say, to work for just a few hours a
day, hence there may be synergies with the Moments of Life product we are
building for working adults,” said Mr Ang.</p>
<p>“This is the beauty of the reusability of the various modules of our Moments
of Life platform, where the technology we build to serve one population
segment can be repurposed quickly and easily to serve another group of
people,” he quipped.</p>
