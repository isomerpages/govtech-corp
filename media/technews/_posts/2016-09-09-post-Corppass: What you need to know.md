<p>Here are some of the important details about how the new Corppass, which
offers a single corporate digital identity for Singapore businesses, works.</p>
<p>For the majority of businesses here, there will be two persons that will
hold key roles in the Corppass system: the registered officer and Corppass
administrator.</p>
<p>The officer is the individual who is officially registered with an Unique
Entity Number (UEN) Issuance Agency or is an appointed executive of the
business, such as the chief executive officer or managing director. As
such, there may be more than one registered officer within the business.</p>
<p>The officer can then appoint administrators, of which there can be a maximum
of two, either by verifying and approving online or providing a letter
of authourisation in a PDF through the Corppass portal.</p>
<p>Administrators can assign access to all digital government services to
themselves.</p>
<p>Later on, the administrator can create, assign and manage user accounts
that allow employees to conduct government-to-business transactions with
specific agencies.</p>
<p>In practice, this is how a small business will use Corppass: Mr Ong, who
owns a small food import business, employs a general manager, Harun, a
finance manager, Juliet, and a human resources manager, Selva.</p>
<p>Mr Ong, as the registered officer, appoints Harun as the Corppass administrator.
Harun then registers as an administrator and assigns himself access to
all digital services, submitting a letter of authourisation on behalf of
Mr Ong as part of the registration process.</p>
<p>Once his status as administrator is approved, Harun can create Corppass
user accounts for Juliet and Selva. Juliet gets assigned access only to
IRAS, while Selva gets assigned access only to the Ministry of Manpower’s
digital services.</p>
<p>Time for Corppass Through an agile, pilot phase approach, the Corppass
team in IDA has been testing the system for stability and making enhancements
along the way.</p>
<p>Since the Corppass trial which began in April this year, more than 1,500
business owners have successfully registered and activated their Corppass
accounts, said Mr Chan Cheow Hoe, Assistant Chief Executive of IDA.</p>
<p>“We encourage businesses to sign up early for Corppass, as this will be
a required login method for most government digital services by the end
of next year,” he added.</p>
