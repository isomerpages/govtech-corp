<p>Singapore’s journey toward a more efficient, digitally connected future
is accelerating, with GovTech leading the charge through innovative solutions.
Taking cue from the Singapore Grand Prix, think of these technologies as
strategic pit stops on a racetrack, each designed to streamline and enhance
our interaction with public services. From accessing grants to <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/how-govtech-is-leading-singapore-fight-against-scams/" class="Hyperlink SCXW226748605 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">safeguarding against <u>scams</u></a>,
these digital tools are essential for keeping Singapore on the fast track
to progress.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>OurSG Grants: Your Gateway to Faster Funding&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://oursggrants.gov.sg/" class="Hyperlink SCXW113840723 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>OurSG Grants portal</u></a> is a
centralised platform designed to simplify the grant application process
for community, arts, heritage, sports, and social good initiatives. By
consolidating information from multiple agencies into one accessible location,
it streamlines the often complex tasks of searching for and applying for
government grants in Singapore. This platform ensures that community-driven
projects can access funding faster, effectively removing barriers and delays
that traditionally hinder the application process.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>SATIS: AI-Powered Scam Detection and Prevention&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-citizens/scam-prevention/" class="Hyperlink SCXW113840723 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS)</u></a> is
GovTech’s latest in the fight against scams in Singapore, developed in
collaboration with Ministry of Home Affairs. Utilising AI and machine learning,
SATIS can rapidly detect, assess, and disrupt malicious websites within
hours, drastically shortening response times compared to traditional methods.
This technology plays a vital role in <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/a-scam-could-cost-someone-s-life-why-govtech-fights-scammers" class="Hyperlink SCXW113840723 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>safeguarding citizens from financial loss and potential harm</u></a>,

about more than just money - it’s fundamentally about ensuring public safety.&nbsp;</p>
