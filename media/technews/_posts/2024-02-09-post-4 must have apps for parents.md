<p>If there were a list of the busiest people in Singapore, we‚Äôd be willing

<p>That being said, we‚Äôve got some good news.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs an array of useful free apps that parents can use to make their
lives a little easier. With these apps, families in Singapore can manage
their daily tasks more efficiently, ensuring that they can focus on what
truly matters - spending quality time together!</p>

<h3>1. Tackle multiple tasks with LifeSG</h3>
<p>Parents often wear multiple hats. They might be property managers for
the family home and teachers to their children. At the same time, they
might be caregivers to their elderly parents. That‚Äôs why the LifeSG app
is perfect for them ‚Äì it‚Äôs the closest thing to a super-app in the GovTech
arsenal. You can use it for multiple tasks such as registering your child‚Äôs
birth, or even end-of-life planning.</p>
<p>Other useful things you can do with it include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Applying for HDB season parking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search for a preschool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check medical appointments at public healthcare institutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report an issue in your neighbourhood</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Managing your finances with MyMoneySense</h3>
<p>Making a big purchase and need to look at the family‚Äôs joint assets? Curious
about what insurance coverage your loved ones actually have? Wonder how
much to go about managing your finances?</p>
<p>Understandably, not everyone has an affinity with spreadsheets and paper
documents, so thankfully, here comes MyMoneySense to the rescue.</p>
<p>Not strictly an app, MyMoneySense is a free government financial planning
service that helps Singaporeans better understand their finances so they
can make conscious choices to improve their financial well-being across
different life stages.</p>
<p>How? For starters, MyMoneySense leverages SGFinDex, a digital infrastructure
that enables you to easily access your financial data across various government
agencies, and financial institutions to get a consolidated view of your
finances.</p>
<p>Think banks, insurers and even your CDP (Central Depository) account.
Find out the full list&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main/sgfindex/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs not all ‚Äì MyMoneySense also teaches you more about your finances
by using objective indicators.</p>
<p>For example: Based on your cash flow and current cash reserves, they can
crunch out an ‚Äòemergency fund ratio‚Äô to see whether you have enough cash
in the case of a loss of income.</p>
<p>Try&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mymoneysense.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyMoneySense out here.</a>
</p>
<h3>3. Keep your family safe with MyENV</h3>
<p>With the haze making its rounds in Singapore again these days, it might
be a good idea to be updated on air quality often. Particularly if the
family is heading out for a hike or a picnic.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs where the MyENV comes in. One of its most popular features is the
alerts function, with 200,000 subscriptions for the air quality 24-hour
PSI alert.</p>
<p>Of course, it‚Äôs more than just a glorified weather app. MyEnv can also
give you updates about dengue hot spots (still a major issue in Singapore),
water levels, floods, water disruptions, hawker centres, food hygiene,
and recycling.</p>
<p>If you want something more customised, you can even bookmark locations
such as your home, office or your child‚Äôs child care centre (or your parent‚Äôs
nursing home) to stay on top of any hazards that appear there!</p>
<p>Download MyEnv&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/initiatives/urban-living/myenv-app/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>
<h3>4. Learn as a family with NLBMobile</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking for a way to bond with your child, reading with them
should be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>You see, reading to children is an intimate ritual that weaves bonds of
emotion and intellect between the caregiver and the child. This is opposed
to, say, giving your child unlimited access to your iPad to watch YouTube
videos.</p>
<p>The extremely popular NLBMobile app lets you skip queues at the library
by using your phone. Borrow books by scanning them, manage your loans,
and even read digital materials such as ebooks ‚Äì all at your fingertips.</p>
<p>For those who are feeling nostalgic, there‚Äôs also NewspaperSG ‚Äì where
you can search the digital archive for newspapers published locally since
1827!</p>
<p>That‚Äôs nearly 200 years of reading to catch up on, longer than Singapore
has been an independent nation!</p>
<p>You can download the NLB mobile app&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileapp.nlb.gov.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>
<h3>5. Keep track of your child‚Äôs progress with Parents Gateway</h3>
<p>Staying updated with your child‚Äôs academic progress and school activities
can sometimes add to the many tasks parents juggle daily. While parents
often rely on massive WhatsApp groups for updates, these chats can sometimes
overflow with non-essential conversations.</p>
<p>Parents Gateway offers a more streamlined approach. It acts as a simple
yet effective link between schools and families, ensuring that parents
receive the most relevant updates. Gone are the days of searching through
endless messages or piecing together scattered information.</p>
<p>With this app, parents can easily access important school announcements,
view a consolidated list of their child‚Äôs activities, and even schedule
Parent-Teacher Meetings without the usual hassle.</p>
<p>For those with children in different schools, the app offers a unified
view, making tracking easier. Additionally, as kids transition between
academic stages, Parents Gateway provides resources to support parents
during these times. It also houses a collection of parenting tips, from
cyber wellness pointers to activity suggestions.</p>
<p>ParentsGateway is downloadable&nbsp;<a href="https://pg.moe.edu.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>
