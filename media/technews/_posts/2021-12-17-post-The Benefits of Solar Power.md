<p>Reservoirs in Singapore are awesome. Not only do they provide the fundamental
resource of water, but they are also great recreational spots for water
sports, hiking, and running.</p>
<p>In July 2021, reservoirs became even more essential as the country’s first
large-scale floating solar farm opened at Tengeh Reservoir.</p>
<p>Why is solar power an ideal alternative energy source? Read on to find
out!</p>

<p>Its 10 islands of solar panels, about the size of 45 football fields,
consist of 122,000 panels that can produce enough electricity to power
16,000 HDB four-room flats for a year.</p>
<p>The solar farm is part of Singapore’s push to have 2 per cent of its energy
needs met by solar energy in 2025. In 2020, solar energy contributed just
0.56 per cent of all energy generated nationwide.</p>
<h3>Just what is solar power?</h3>
<p>Solar is about harnessing the energy of the sun. One major way of doing
this is through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/how-does-solar-work" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">photovoltaic (PV) panels</a>,
such as those deployed on Tengeh Reservoir. The PV cells absorb energy
from sunlight, creating electrical charge within the cells and causing
electricity to flow.</p>
<p>Another type of solar energy is concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP),
which uses mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlight, converting it to
heat energy that can be used for heating or running electrical turbines.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Although solar energy is often talked about as the energy source
of the future, inventors were filing patents for solar panels as far back
as the 1880s! Check out this link to see a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/brief-history-solar-panels-180972006/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">picture of solar panels</a>&nbsp;installed
on a New York City roof in 1884.</p>
<h3>Solar energy in Singapore</h3>
<p>As an island nation that is vulnerable to the long-term effects of climate
change, Singapore has explored alternative energy, but its options are&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/singapore-approach-to-alternative-energy/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">limited</a>&nbsp;because:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Average wind speed here is too slow for commercial wind turbines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The narrow tidal range and calm seas are not conducive for tidal power
generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no fast-flowing river for hydroelectric power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no geothermal sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limited landmass constrains the safe use of nuclear power</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Solar energy is therefore the most viable, especially with our tropical
“summer all year weather” providing us with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/Solar_Photovoltaic_Systems.aspx" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">50 per cent more</a>&nbsp;solar
radiation than temperate countries. In addition, solar energy is:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Carbon emission-free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires no import of fuels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can lower peak demand as energy usage typically peaks in the afternoon,
coinciding with the periods of the greatest output of solar energy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are still obstacles, such as high cloud cover across Singapore
(the days when we feel some relief from the scorching heat) and limited
land for large-scale deployment of solar panels.</p>
<p>The Tengeh Reservoir floating solar farm is a good example of how we’re
overcoming land constraints, but the effort to boost solar energy adoption
has been years in the making.</p>
<h3>Solar energy boost</h3>
<p>Singapore’s solar PV capacity grew a whopping&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/singapore-energy-statistics/Ch06/index6" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">38 times</a>&nbsp;between
2012 and 2020. This was driven by significant jumps in the non-resident
private-sector installations and town councils (mainly on the rooftops
of HDB blocks).</p>
<p>Source: Energy Market Authority - Singapore</p>
<p>As of December 2020, almost 2,500 HDB blocks have been installed with
solar panels. The electricity that is generated is used primarily to power
common services in HDB estates, with excess energy channelled into the
electrical grid. On average, HDB blocks produce more energy than they consume,
thus achieving net-zero energy consumption in common areas!</p>
<p>To keep up the good progress in renewable energy, the government has also
called for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/move-to-install-solar-panels-at-nearly-1200-more-hdb-blocks" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">tenders</a>&nbsp;in
March 2021 to equip another 6,900 blocks with solar power systems. According
to the HDB, this is equivalent to powering 82,500 four-room flats with
solar energy, potentially reducing carbon emissions by 198,000 tonnes a
year.</p>
<p>Other public sector buildings getting into the act include schools and
fire stations.</p>
<p>A major reason for this rapid growth is the 2014 launch of the&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/solarnova-page" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SolarNova Programme</a>, which promotes and aggregates demand for solar
energy across all government agencies, thereby reaping economies of scale.</p>
<h3>What the future holds</h3>
<p>Solar power capacity will continue to be ramped up to meet the nation’s
2025 target. We are already planning to have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/pub-eyes-2-large-scale-floating-solar-farms-at-lower-seletar-and-pandan" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">two more large-scale</a>&nbsp;floating
solar farms at Lower Seletar Reservoir and Pandan Reservoir.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Singapore aims to deploy at least&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/Solar_Photovoltaic_Systems.aspx" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2 gigawatt-peak (GWp)</a>&nbsp;of
solar energy by 2030, or the equivalent of powering about 350,000 households
for a year.</p>
<p>Another trend that has been catching on in recent years is to blend solar
panels into the overall facade of a building in an aesthetically pleasing
manner. Known as&nbsp;<a href="https://bipv.sg/singapore/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Building Integrated PV</a>,
prominent examples include the Sports Hub and Biopolis. Now you’re not
just saving the planet, you’re doing it in style!</p>
