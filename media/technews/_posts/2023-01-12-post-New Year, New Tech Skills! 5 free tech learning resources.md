<p><em>What will you be learning in 2023?</em>
</p>
<p>Any New Year resolutions that revolve around learning or upgrading your
skills? Today‚Äôs article is just for you!</p>
<p>As a tech hub, Singapore is host to the regional headquarters of several
global tech companies. The city-state is also home to a vibrant startup
scene that has produced its share of unicorns. Other industries, from financial
institutions to fast-moving consumer goods, have also been building up
their tech workforce.</p>
<p>Little wonder, then, that tech skills continue to be in demand. If you‚Äôve
ever considered picking up these skills and becoming a tech professional,
there are a myriad of resources to turn to both online and in the classroom.</p>
<p>But as the saying goes, the best things in life are free. So here, we
highlight a few options that will not only give you an introduction to
the world of tech, but also won‚Äôt cost you money.</p>
<h3>AI Singapore Student Outreach Programme</h3>
<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.aisingapore.org/student-outreach-programme/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">scheme</a>&nbsp;by
AI Singapore was launched in July 2022 to promote AI literacy and proficiency
among students.</p>
<p>The programme, which is open to students from secondary school to university,
consists of three levels and will equip participants with programming skills
and practical experience in AI projects. Completion of each level will
earn students an industry-recognised certificate and those who finish level
three will receive the Google professional machine learning engineer certificate.</p>
<p>Polytechnic and university students who attain level three will also get
an internship opportunity to work with AI Singapore‚Äôs AI engineers and
AI apprentices on real-world projects.</p>
<p>Applications are open all year round for the first two levels, while level
three accepts applications in January and August every year.</p>
<h3>SkillsFuture@NS Learning eXperience Platform</h3>
<p>While many full time national servicemen (NSFs) today are proud to be
contributing to the military and civil defence of our country, there is
still the concern of lagging behind in their studies and careers due to
the two years in uniform. To address this, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ns.gov.sg/web/profiles/nsf/impt-full-time-ns-info#continual-learning-during-ns" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SkillsFuture@NS Learning eXperience Platform</a>&nbsp;was
launched in November 2022, giving NSFs free unlimited access to over 75,000
online courses in about 135 categories.</p>
<p>Skills that they can pick up include Python programming, machine learning,
management training, and digital photography.</p>
<p>Some of the courses can also be used for credit exemptions at institutes
of higher learning like polytechnics and universities.</p>
<h3>Coursera</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Coursera</a>,
a pioneer in massive open online courses, offers many of its courses for
free. Best of all, some are from world-renowned universities.</p>

Stanford University,&nbsp;COVID-19 contact tracing&nbsp;from Johns Hopkins
University or the&nbsp;disease&nbsp;in general from Imperial College London,&nbsp;microeconomics&nbsp;from
the University of Pennsylvania, and the&nbsp;principles of computer programming&nbsp;from
Princeton University.</p>

<h3>General Assembly</h3>
<p><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">General Assembly</a> is
known for running boot camps for mid-career switchers who aspire to a new
path in tech as software engineers, data scientists, and product managers.</p>
<p>While these bootcamps usually involve monetary commitment and a few months
of effort, they also run free, short courses for those who are curious
about tech.</p>
<p>These include introduction courses to&nbsp;Python coding,&nbsp;data analytics,&nbsp;UX
design, and&nbsp;digital marketing. There are also classes on specific
tools that you can put to use immediately, like Excel and Google Analytics.</p>
<p>You can even access resources on general skills, such as a class on&nbsp;public
speaking.</p>
<h3>Explore and expand your knowledge</h3>
<p>It can be daunting to consider a career in tech, whether you‚Äôre thinking
of choosing a tech major when entering a tertiary institute or thinking
of switching to a tech career.</p>
<p>The great thing about these free resources is that it gives you a chance
to dip your toes in the tech pool to see if you can build up sustained
interest and momentum to continue pursuing something more long-term in
tech.</p>
<p>All it takes is some time commitment and an open mind to really give it
a go and see if it‚Äôs your cup of tea.</p>
