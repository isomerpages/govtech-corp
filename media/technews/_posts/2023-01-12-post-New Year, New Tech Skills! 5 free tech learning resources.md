<p>As a tech hub, Singapore is host to the regional headquarters of several
global tech companies. The city-state is also home to a vibrant startup
scene that has produced its share of unicorns. Other industries, from financial
institutions to fast-moving consumer goods, have also been building up
their tech workforce.</p>
<p>Little wonder, then, that tech skills continue to be in demand. If you‚Äôve
ever considered picking up these skills and becoming a tech professional,
there are a myriad of resources to turn to both online and in the classroom.</p>
<p>But as the saying goes, the best things in life are free. So here, we
highlight a few options that will not only give you an introduction to
the world of tech, but also won‚Äôt cost you money.</p>
