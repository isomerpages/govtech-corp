<p>As the lead agency in digitalising public services in Singapore, GovTech
seeks to ensure <a href="/about-us/what-we-do/our-role/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>digital transformation</u></a> benefits
everyone of all abilities. That is why we hold events such as A11y Week,
the government‚Äôs digital inclusion learning festival for all public officers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest edition of A11y Week in May 2024 was all the more significant
as it brought together the government, industry players, and end users
in a new initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Called the Co-Creation Lab, the event kickstarted a wide-ranging conversation
on how we can make <a href="/products-and-services/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singapore‚Äôs digital services</u></a> truly
accessible for all.</p>
<h3>Hearing first-hand pain points</h3>
<p>Indeed, the first session ‚Äî attended by 95 participants from the Persons
with Disabilities and Senior communities, as well as digital product teams
from the public and private sectors, including the banking, e-commerce,
healthcare, and transportation industries ‚Äî yielded valuable insights that
will directly inform the development of current and future digital services.</p>
<p>Product teams from DBS, Doctor Anywhere, EZ-Link, Grab, HPB, HTX, OCBC,
Synapxe, TransitLink, UOB, and yuu attended the event. Nominated MP Ong
Hua Han, who champions causes for Persons with Disabilities and has raised
related issues in Parliament, also took part.</p>
<p>By keeping it real throughout the discussions, end users could share their
on-the-ground experiences, both positive and negative, while navigating
digital services. Despite their different backgrounds, they surfaced similar
challenges, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Seniors feel that banking services are increasingly inaccessible because
of the digital-first strategy of financial institutions. They struggle
with basic tasks such as logging in, are hesitant to make online transactions
out of fear of making a mistake, and are afraid they will fall victim to
scams and lose their hard-earned savings.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day-to-day tasks are also a struggle when digital services are not optimised
for accessibility. For instance, ordering via restaurant QR code services
is often incompatible with the VoiceOver function, so people who cannot
see the screens of their devices cannot order their food through this means.
Tele-consultations ‚Äî which have gained popularity post-pandemic ‚Äî are also
inaccessible to deaf individuals because sign language interpreters are
not on hand to translate.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, attendees provided thoughtful feedback like: &nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>SMS OTP timeout durations should be lengthened to accommodate users who
are not familiar with smart devices and need more time to navigate the
different apps.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interpreters or caregivers should be allowed on tele-consultations to
support the patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involve more Seniors and Persons with Disabilities in the product development
process to better support user needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enhancing product development with direct feedback</h3>
<p>While there are existing efforts to engage various stakeholders on inclusivity,
the Co-Creation Lab is the first platform focused on bringing the public
and private sectors, as well as users, together to improve the accessibility
of digital products and services in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This multi-way dialogue will give product teams a deeper understanding
of end users with different needs while ensuring that Persons with Disabilities
and Seniors have their requirements included during the product development
process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, it will surface themes and issues that can be quickly addressed
and tabled for consideration for longer-term, potentially system-level
changes.</p>
<h3>Private sector tech teams, we want to hear from you!</h3>
<p>At the conclusion of A11y Week, participants expressed a keen interest
in participating in subsequent runs of the Co-Creation Lab and further
exploring the topics discussed. Product representatives were also eager
to integrate accessibility considerations into their work.</p>
<p>GovTech is seeking to include greater diversity in the Co-Creation Lab‚Äôs
participants and is studying how to involve the greater tech community
for longer-term, sustainable change. If you‚Äôre part of a product team in
the private sector and want to collaborate on inclusivity issues, we can‚Äôt
wait to hear from you!</p>
<p>PS: Another way to reach out to us is via <a href="/our-communities/join-our-communities/tech-kaki/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Tech Kaki</u></a>,
our community of end-users who provide feedback on our products and whether
they meet the needs of citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we believe it will be a springboard for deeper engagement
between the government, industry, and the community. We are hopeful that
this collaborative spirit will pave the way for a more inclusive digital
future for all Singaporeans.</p>
