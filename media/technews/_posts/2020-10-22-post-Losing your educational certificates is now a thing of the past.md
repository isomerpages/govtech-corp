<h3>Have you ever searched high and low for your certificate, Diploma, or University degree, only to find out that your mom â€˜Marie Kondo-edâ€™ your room and misplaced that precious scroll? We get you! For us, 80s and 90s kids, the case of missing certifications is a real thing.</h3>

</p>
<p>Well, you can now say â€˜sayonaraâ€™ to that activity.</p>
<p>If you havenâ€™t heard, you can now access your GCE O, N and A level results
via the&nbsp;SingPass Mobile app.</p>
<p>A project&nbsp;between SkillsFuture Singapore, the Ministry of Education,
and GovTech called OpenCerts uses blockchain (yes, blockchain is not just
limited to cryptocurrency) to issue verifiable certifications.</p>
<p>Okay, but apart from not arguing with your mom about a lost cert, what
are the advantages?</p>
<p>Well, plenty! But letâ€™s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>To understand the advantages, we must first start at the very beginning.
Which brings us toâ€¦</p>
<h3>How does it work now?</h3>
<p>At present, schools rely on scattered databases to verify diplomas and
other certifications. This process is messy and time-consuming! Case in
point:&nbsp;Ngee Ann Polytechnic issues 10,000 physical certificates every
year&nbsp;â€” each of these certificates is printed and manually stamped!
In addition, the school also receives 2,000 requests annually for verification
from employers and universities. Put the two together, and you get tedious
manual labour that takes up precious time and resources.</p>
<h3>Okay, but how will blockchain make things better?</h3>
<p>To understand this, you must first understand what blockchain is.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is best explained as an open-source, decentralised database
(we use databases to help you understand, but the correct term is ledger)
that many users have access to.</p>
<p>With blockchain, many users have full visibility over all transactions
that happen in the database. In theory, this makes blockchain a very open
and transparent system.</p>
<p>This is opposed to, say, a traditional centralised database that only
one organisation (for example, a government agency) has access to.</p>
<h3>Okay, for real this time, how will blockchain make things better?</h3>
<p>OpenCerts will include a wide range of digital certificates, including
stuff like your N, O, and A Levels, ITE qualifications, Diploma and degree
qualifications from polytechnics, LASALLE College of the Arts (LASALLE),
Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), Autonomous Universities (AUs) and
the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC), as well as
Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) digital certificates.</p>
<p>Leveraging the power of blockchain, students could use certifications
on OpenCerts in the future to apply for jobs and tertiary institutions.</p>
<p>In turn, having all the certs on OpenCerts will allow entities such as
employers and universities to verify certifications way faster than it
will in a traditional paper check â€“ Simply drag and drop a certificate
file on the&nbsp;<a href="https://opencerts.io/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCerts website</a>;
for the HR professionals, companies can integrate OpenCerts verification
into their existing HR systems through the API endpoints, making verification
that much simpler!</p>
<p>This has several benefits over the current system:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Lower maintenance and manpower costs:</strong> As mentioned, schools
expend precious resources chasing down certs for verification. There are
some savings (and eco-friendly benefits) in issuing certs that are not
printed as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verification and security</strong>: Using something called a â€˜cryptographic
hashâ€™, blockchain can timestamp certs to make sure they remain unchanged
â€“ this makes it easy for any discrepancies to be easily spotted, and those
who try to forge certificates or degrees from Singaporean institutions
will also be found out pretty quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>: The current verification process is a manual one
that can take days. With OpenCerts, this will be reduced to a matter of
seconds! Neato!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At GovTech, we are currently revamping the way we issue Certificates of
Achievement to our interns. Gone are the days when interns only had a hard
copy or PDF version of their certificate. Beyond just a simple certificate,
it can also include testimonials from their supervisors. If you are interested
to issue a document for your organisation, do check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.opencerts.io/docs" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a>&nbsp;for
a step by step walkthrough on the process.</p>
<h3>First digital certs â€“ whatâ€™s next?</h3>
<p>It might seem awfully cutting-edge to issue certs via blockchain in 2020,
but as the technology becomes more prevalent, who knows what other interesting
applications there will be in say, 5-10 years?</p>
<p>After all, the use cases of transparent, verifiable blocks of data are
endless.</p>
