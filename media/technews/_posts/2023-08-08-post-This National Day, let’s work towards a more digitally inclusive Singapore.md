<p>As Singapore turns 58 years old this year, various ministries across the
Government have laid out plans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ministries-outline-plans-for-more-inclusive-singapore-sustainable-finances-and-access-to-justice" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">for a more inclusive Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>GovTech is no exception. In particular, we’re working hard to make Singapore
more digitally inclusive.</p>
<p>A11y Week, organised annually by our very own Accessibility Enabling Team
(or A11y Team for short), is a learning festival for all public officers
in Singapore. The week-long event aims to foster an understanding and appreciation
of accessible and inclusive design in digital services.</p>
<p>Through insightful talks and engaging workshops, attendees gain knowledge
and experience in creating digital experiences that everyone can enjoy
and benefit from.</p>
<p>A11y Week 2023 ran from May 16 – 18, culminating on Global Accessibility
Awareness Day. This year’s theme was&nbsp;<em>“Understand &amp; Understood: Making Communication Inclusive for All”</em>.
It was inspired by the A11y Team’s engagement with the Persons With Disabilities
(PWDs) community, where they learned how people with congenital or acquired
conditions are excluded from society when communications are not designed
inclusively.</p>
<p>2023’s event sought to bring these individuals into the greater digitalisation
conversation and to raise awareness of their challenges.</p>
<p>Attended by public service officers from over 80 government agencies,
the hybrid event featured virtual talks and – for the first time since
A11y Week began during the pandemic – 4 in-person interactive workshops.
Over 160 attendees showed up in person.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at some of the highlights:</p>
<h3>Everyone Is Welcome</h3>
<p>This year’s speakers were meticulously chosen not just because they were
experts in their respective fields, but because they also had firsthand
experience with the challenges posed by inaccessible communication. The
lineup featured a diverse range of tech professionals and advocates from
the PwD community.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Shanta Arul, Public Policy Director of Technology &amp; Innovation at
Netflix, spoke about how Netflix looks at accessibility fundamentals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah Yong, Fadillah Noor, and Sayfullah, Committee Members at ISAAC SG,
shared their journey of helping Sayfullah find his voice through Alternative
and Augmentative Communication (AAC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winston Wong, Special Education Needs (SEN) Officer at Temasek Polytechnic
and Disability Advocate, provided actionable tips to better support students
with SEN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rory Preddy, Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft, discussed how AI can
help with coding accessibility into products.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure that everyone, regardless of their position or level, would
benefit from the event, the learning festival was curated to be inclusive
for all attendees. The program included technical workshops, advocacy talks,
and discussions on thought leadership and tech trends, designed to engage
attendees from all backgrounds and levels, from individual contributors
to officers in leadership positions.</p>
<h3>Practical Lessons for Accessibility</h3>
<p>One workshop, Empathy Lab, was designed to familiarise attendees with
the principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>

</p>
<p>One of the workshop’s most popular activities was, “How universal are
our icons?”, where attendees were asked to label icons used in popular
Government apps from memory, without their usual text labels. This highlighted
how easily icons can be misunderstood if they are not intuitive, lack proper
text labels, or contain too many small details.</p>
<p>The Inclusion Playscape, a carnival-style, in-person session, sought to
educate attendees about accessibility through experiencing inaccessibility.</p>
<p>One particular station,&nbsp;<em>“A11y Tic Tac Toe”</em>, highlighted
how a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe could be much more challenging when
accessibility considerations are not incorporated into its design and development.
A pair of players had to play the game without being able to see the Tic-Tac-Toe
board, using only a screen reader and a keyboard to navigate the grid.</p>

<h3>Put on your Purple HATS</h3>
<p>Purple is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purpleparade.sg/" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">colour of inclusivity</a>&nbsp;in
Singapore, and the Purple HATS testing tool was developed by the A11y Team
to scan agency websites for accessibility.</p>

</p>
<p><em>Image Description: Photo of a laptop displaying the Purple HATS Desktop App in the foreground and a room full of participants in the background listening in to the workshop presentation.</em>
</p>
<p>This open-sourced, customisable accessibility testing tool enables software
development teams to identify and correct accessibility issues to improve
digital services for PWDs and the elderly.</p>
<p>It helps development teams scan and check for potential accessibility
issues for newly developed and existing websites and can be easily integrated
into a software development team’s workflow.</p>
<p>In line with their greater mission, the A11y Team continue to develop
Purple HATS to make it more user-friendly and accessible for all users.
For instance, the tool’s reports are generated in a user-friendly HTML
format. A new Graphical User Interface (GUI) feature was introduced this
year to simplify the use of the testing tool, particularly for those who
are not as well-versed in command-line operations.</p>
<p>The reception was overwhelmingly positive with A11y Week attendees, even
those with limited technical knowledge, navigating the new interface with
little need for guidance from the technical workshop’s facilitators.</p>
<h3>An A11y’s Work is Never Done</h3>
<p>A11y Week might be over, but the work for digital inclusivity continues.</p>
<p>The team is now working on Playground, an upcoming initiative to help
people who are just getting started with accessibility. It is an application
that demonstrates common accessibility issues, particularly for keyboard
navigation, found in transactional and informational websites.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that digital inclusion is not a one-time fix
but an ongoing journey of learning and empathy.</p>
<p>As we celebrate Singapore’s 58th National Day, let’s strive to create
a more digitally inclusive society where no one is left behind. From all
of us here at GovTech, here’s to a more accessible and inclusive future
and a very happy National Day!</p>
