<h3>Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC): Enhancing the way government agencies onboard services into the cloud</h3>
<p>Offering multiple benefits such as cost savings, collaboration and remote
access, scalability and enhanced data security, cloud solutions have become
the preferred option for the Singapore government.</p>
<p>GovTech introduced the Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) platform to
offer government agencies a consistent way of adopting commercial solutions
offered by cloud service providers. To date, over 600 government digital
services are on the GCC.

<h3>What's the latest on GCC?</h3>
<p>GCC 1.0 has been redesigned to give rise to GCC 2.0, leveraging on existing
cloud-native capabilities and aligning with cloud security practices while
enabling product teams to onboard easily and deliver on government digital
services more quickly at reduced costs.</p>
<p>With GCC 2.0, the GCC will be leveraged as a whole-of-government (WOG)
platform along with the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) (Link to
SGTS product page) for modern app development</p>

<p>As of 14 November 2023, the GCC Foundation Training and Certification
have also been cessated with no substitute programme. Agency users preparing
to onboard to GCC 2.0 are highly recommended to pursue cloud-native certificates
instead.</p>
