<p>GovTech introduced the Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) platform to
provide government agencies with a standardised approach to adopting commercial
solutions offered by cloud service providers.</p>
<p>Initially designed to facilitate and expedite the adoption of Commercial
Cloud by agencies within the Whole-of-Government (WOG), GCC empowers WOG
to efficiently deliver Government Digital Services with enhanced speed,
security, and cost-effectiveness, leveraging modern application development
practices.</p>
<p>As a unified platform, GCC enhances observability, auditability, and monitoring
capabilities for both agencies and the WOG. Notably, over 70% of eligible
government systems are already on the commercial cloud, with key government
services such as <a href="https://www.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MyCareersFuture</a>,
<a href="/products-and-services/for-businesses/corporate-transactions/gobusiness/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GoBusiness</a>, <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/data-and-ai/wogaa/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">WOGAA</a> being
developed and implemented on GCC.</p>

<h3>What's next for GCC?</h3>
<p>GCC will serve as a comprehensive platform for modern application development
for the entire government, in conjunction with the <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/software-development/sg-tech-stack/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Government Tech Stack</a>.</p>
<p>It is committed to broadening its array of services and features, with
a persistent focus on maintaining resource compliance and security, enabling
effortless scalability, and improving agencies' budget planning and cost
control. Furthermore, the incorporation of tools such as the Cost Optimisation
Dashboard and Sustainability Dashboard will empower the Whole-of-Government
(WOG) to pinpoint potential cost-saving opportunities and enhance sustainability
performance tracking, offering valuable insights for informed decision-making.</p>
<p>As of 14 November 2023, the GCC Foundation Training and Certification
has ceased with no substitute programme. Agency users preparing to join
GCC 2.0 are highly recommended to pursue cloud-native certificates instead.</p>
