<p>Offering multiple benefits such as cost savings, collaboration and remote
access, scalability and enhanced data security, cloud solutions have become
the preferred option for the Singapore government.</p>
<p>GovTech introduced the Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) platform to
offer government agencies a consistent way of adopting commercial solutions
offered by cloud service providers. To date, over 600 government digital
services are on the GCC.

<h3>How to use GCC?</h3>

the Singapore Government Developer Portal.</p>
<h3>What's the latest on GCC?</h3>
<p>GCC 1.0 has been revamped to GCC 2.0, which harnesses existing cloud-native
capabilities and is aligned with cloud security practices. It enables product
teams to get on board quickly and fast-tracks the delivery of digital services
at reduced costs.</p>
<p>With GCC 2.0, the GCC will be leveraged as a Whole-of-Government platform
along with the <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/software-development/sg-tech-stack/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singapore Government Tech Stack</u></a> for
modern app development.</p>

<p>As of 14 November 2023, the GCC Foundation Training and Certification
has ceased with no substitute programme. Agency users preparing to join
GCC 2.0 are highly recommended to pursue cloud-native certificates instead.</p>
