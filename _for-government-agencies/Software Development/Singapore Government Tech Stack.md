<h3>Build government digital services quickly and securely with Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)</h3>
<p>SGTS is a common platform that makes the process of building digital services
simpler and more streamlined for government agencies.</p>
<p>Agencies would be able to tap on a suite of tools and services hosted
on a common infrastructure to ensure consistency and high quality of their
applications</p>
<p>One of the early uses of SGTS was the MyInfo bank pilot, delivered in
four months instead of the usual timeframe of a year. MyCareersFuture was
also built on SGTS.</p>
<p>More than 200 systems from 40 agencies have already reaped the benefits
of SGTS by implementing their services or applications on cloud</p>
