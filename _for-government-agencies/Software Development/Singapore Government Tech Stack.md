<hr>
<p>Every digital service that the government launches is aimed at enriching
a certain aspect of Singaporeans' lives. To help our sister agencies get
their ideas quickly to launch instead of spending time in development limbo,
we created the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS).</p>
<p>The SGTS makes the process of building digital services simpler and more
streamlined. Personnel can tap on a common suite of tools and products
to develop high-quality digital services that are consistent with other
government offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the early uses of SGTS was the creation of Myinfo for a bank pilot
project. The project was successfully delivered in four months instead
of the usual timeframe of a year. MyCareersFuture was also built using
SGTS.</p>
<p>Today, more than 40 agencies have already reaped the benefits of utilising
SGTS, implementing over 200 systems on cloud.</p>
<h3>Why use SGTS?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why you should use SGTS.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Develop a seamless, consistent and connected experience across the government's
digital services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable the easy exchange of data across the government for richer insights
that will help with policy and solution development as well as monitoring
of operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on designing solutions that best meet the needs of your agency's
customers and accelerate their deployment without the need to develop infrastructure
from scratch.</p>
<p></p>
