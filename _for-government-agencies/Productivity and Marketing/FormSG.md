<h3>Draft secure government forms in minutes with FormSG</h3>
<p>In a bid to replace the use of paper forms in the public service sector,
GovTech created FormSG. This form builder tool enables public officers
to create digital government forms within minutes. It can be used to create
different types of forms, from visitor health and travel declarations to
post in-camp training surveys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, 160 government agencies have used it to create over 600,000 forms
and to collect key data from residents and businesses in a secure manner.</p>
