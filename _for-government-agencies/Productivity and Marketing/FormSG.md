GovTech created FormSG. This form builder tool enables public officers
to create digital government forms within minutes. It can be used to create
different types of forms, from visitor health and travel declarations to
post in-camp training surveys. Today, 160 government agencies have used
it to create over 600,000 forms and to collect key data from residents
