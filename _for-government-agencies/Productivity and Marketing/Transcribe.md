</p>
<p>Transcribe is a Speech-to-Text (STT) platform with auto-transcription
technologies</p>
<p>Users can upload a pre-recorded audio or video file, or attain a live
transcription instantaneously</p>
<p>Transcribe was first used in Parliament sittings and users were able to
reduce the man hours from 2.5hrs to 1.5hrs for each 15 min transcript produced.</p>
<p>Transcribe achieved more than a 200% year-on-year growth when it comes
to the number of registered users.</p>
<h3>Why use Transcribe?</h3>
<p>Its Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) enable integration with
other systems.</p>
<p>Given the confidential nature of government documents, the platform is
designed to be secure, yet easily accessible.</p>
<p>Available on both Internet and the Intranet environment for flexible use.</p>
<p>Hosts up to RESTRICTED and SENSITIVE (NORMAL) data.</p>
<p>Auto-onboard all public officers via WOG AAD authentication.</p>
<p>Coverage includes four languages (English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil),
multiple audio formats (e.g. mp3, wav, m4a, wma, aac) and video formats
(e.g. mp4, avi).</p>
<p>Multiple users can enjoy concurrent viewing or live transcriptions, instead
of waiting for its completion.</p>
