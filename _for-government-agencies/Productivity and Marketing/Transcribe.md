<hr>
<p>Transcribing interviews, speeches and meeting minutes is a labour-intensive
and time-consuming task. While there are many speech-to-text platforms
in the market, they are not suited for handling confidential and sensitive
government data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bridging this gap, GovTech created Transcribe, a platform that boasts
auto-transcription technologies.&nbsp;Transcribe has a web application
for public officersâ€™ usage and an API platform to support system integration.</p>
<p>Users can simply record a live meeting or upload a pre-recorded file and
receive a transcription instantaneously.</p>
<p>Transcribe was first used in Parliament sittings where users were able
to reduce the man hours needed for processing each 15-minute transcript
from 2.5 hours to 1.5 hours. As a testament to its usefulness, the web
app has achieved over a 200 per cent year-on-year growth in user registration
since its launch.</p>
