<h3>Pair Chat: Transforming ways of working for public officers through AI </h3>
<p>For many working adults in Singapore, ChatGPT has become a great productivity
tool that speeds up daily&nbsp; tasks. Wanting to let public officers enjoy
the benefits of using an AI chatbot, we set out to create Pair Chat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast and free to use, this government AI chatbot is your virtual personal
assistant that helps you with writing emails, conducting research and generating
ideas. Powered by the same Large Language Models (LLMs) that ChatGPT is
built on, Pair Chat is available for use on all government-issued devices.</p>
<p>Pair Chat has proven to be a hit among public officers. Within just the
first two months of its trial launch, it has already garnered over 11,000
users across more than 100 government agencies. Today, it has 4,500-plus
weekly active users.</p>
