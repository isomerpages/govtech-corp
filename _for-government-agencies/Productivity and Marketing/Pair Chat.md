<h3>Transforming ways of working for public officers through AI with Pair Chat</h3>
<p>Created by GovTech, Pair Chat is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool
driven by AI technology, currently powered by the same Large Language Models
(LLM) underlying ChatGPT.</p>
<p>This is a free, fast and secure version of ChatGPT for public officers,
acting as a virtual personal assistant that can help to conduct research,
generate ideas, compose messages and more and is available on all eligible
government devices.</p>
<p>Within just the first 2 months of its trial launch, Pair Chat had garnered
over 11,000 users across more than 100 government agencies, with more than
4,500 weekly active users.</p>
