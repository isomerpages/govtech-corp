<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to unlock possibilities like never
before. To help our sister agencies kickstart their own AI transformation
journeys, we unveiled LaunchPad, an innovation and experimentation platform.</p>
<p>It offers various in-house solutions to let public officers experience
the latest features in generative AI and test the capabilities of different
large language models (LLMs).</p>
<p>It also boasts Ideathon, a platform where individuals or teams across
the entire government sector can come together to identify bottlenecks,
propose ideas, and then brainstorm innovative solutions. Going beyond the
ChatGPT-based model that powers <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/productivity-and-marketing/pair/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Pair Chat</u></a>,
this tool is built on a set of multiple models and enables users to ideate
freely. Users can also enjoy more control over the responses generated
by each model.</p>
