<p>From CDC Vouchers to Climate Vouchers, the Singapore government from time
to time will introduce schemes to help citizens with their costs of living
or to incentivise them to embrace positive lifestyles.</p>
<p>This has engendered a need for a trusted system that allows agencies to
easily create, issue and track the redemption of vouchers. GovTech rose
to the challenge by creating RedeemSG. As its name suggests, the platform
allows Singaporean citizens to redeem vouchers easily; onboarded merchants
can also accept government-issued vouchers as payments.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>To date, RedeemSG has facilitated over $204 million worth of transactions
involving more than 19,000 merchants. 98% of Singaporean households have
claimed at least one voucher using RedeemSG, with 2023 alone seeing 21
campaigns and over 1.2 million vouchers claimed.</p>
<p>Besides government-issued vouchers, the platform has also been used for
the redemption of Nee Soon Cares Vouchers and Temasek Poly Care Network
Vouchers.</p>
