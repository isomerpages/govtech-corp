<h3>Enabling public officers with efficient analysis of textual data with GovText.</h3>
<p>This is a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based text analytics
platform that automatically analyses unstructured text data and produces
results that can help users better understand the contents</p>
<p>This platform is offered as a web portal tool and as a model-hosting platform,
with the latter providing text analytics services via APIs for government
agencies</p>
<p>This platform was useful for the development of the Municipal Services
Office (MSO) Chatbot, or OneService Chatbot, where its capabilities enabled
the prediction of the case category of the feedback received and the agency
that should respond.</p>
<h3>Why use GovText?</h3>
<p>GovText currently has 2 tools - Topic Modelling and Summarisation.</p>
<h4><u>Topic Modelling</u></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Products and Services/_compressed__wordcloud_screenshot.jpg">
</div>
<p>A statistical technique that can be used to discover hidden topics (collections
of words and phrases centred around different themes) within a set of documents.</p>
<p>Through data visualisations and an interactive dashboard, you will be
able to understand the topic models from both a high-level perspective
and a low-level, detailed view.</p>
<p>You can also see the different topics (and their constituent words) in
the entire dataset, as well as the proportions of different topics in individual
documents.</p>
<p>Public officers can use Topic Modelling to process data from surveys or
feedback forms in order to better understand the key topics and findings
from such surveys and feedback forms.</p>
<h4><u>Summarisation</u></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Products and Services/summarisation_screenshot.jpg">
</div>
<p>This is the process of generating a shortened version of a document that
is concise and retains the essential information in the original document.
GovText offers two types of summarisation:</p>
<p>The first type of summarisation is Abstractive Summarisation (Normal Mode),
where the key points of an article are paraphrased into a short and coherent
paragraph, by a language model pre-trained on news articles and open datasets.</p>
<p>The second type is Extractive Summarisation (Quick Mode), where the most
important sentences from an article are stacked together to create a summary.
The lack of paraphrasing is compensated with a faster processing speed.</p>
<p>This can be used to speed up the reading and digesting of information,
ultimately improving efficiency and providing time-savings.</p>
