<p>VAS is a government platform that uses video analytics (VA) to analyze
video data, extract insights, and automate tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze vast amounts of video data efficiently, saving time and costs
by reducing manual analysis needs.</p>

<p>Used by the National Parks Board to enforce safe distancing during COVID-19.</p>

<p>The amount of video data collected on a daily basis has increased exponentially
over the years. In fact, it has reached a point where it is not humanly
possible – nor is it productive – to deploy manpower to review the massive
amount of footage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, GovTech developed the Video Analytics System (VAS), which harnesses
the power of VA algorithms, to monitor video data, investigate and analyse
real-time occurrences, all while extracting insights and trends for further
analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed for the needs of government agencies, VAS allows them to kickstart,
deploy and develop VA projects quickly and effortlessly. They can tap their
own videos and videos from other agencies, make use of existing VA algorithms
from GovTech and across the Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) ecosystem.</p>
<p>The VAS has been a key enabler in numerous government initiatives. The
National Parks Board, for example, used it to facilitate safe distancing
at public parks during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
