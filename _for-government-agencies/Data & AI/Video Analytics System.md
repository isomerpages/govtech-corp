<h3>Automating analysis processes with Video Analytics System (VAS)</h3>
<p>The amount of video data collected on a daily basis has increased exponentially
over the years. In fact, it has reached a point where it is not humanly
possible – nor is it productive – to deploy manpower to review the massive
amount of footage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, GovTech developed the Video Analytics System (VAS), which harnesses
the power of VA algorithms, to monitor video data, investigate and analyse
real-time occurrences, all while extracting insights and trends for further
analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed for the needs of government agencies, VAS allows them to kickstart,
deploy and develop VA projects quickly and effortlessly. They can tap their
own videos and videos from other agencies, make use of existing VA algorithms
from GovTech and across the Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) ecosystem.</p>
<p>The VAS has been a key enabler in numerous government initiatives. The
National Parks Board, for example, used it to facilitate safe distancing
at public parks during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>Automating analysis processes across WOG with Video Analytics System (VAS)</h3>
<p>This system makes use of Video Analytics (VA) algorithms to monitor, investigate
and analyse real-time occurrences, while also extracting insights and trends
for further analysis.</p>
<p>It has been implemented in conjunction with other government agencies
- such as with NEA to keep our environment smoke-free, and with NParks
to facilitate safe distancing at parks during COVID.</p>
<p>As a central platform, VAS aims to: Enable agencies to explore the use
of video analytics, develop and deploy VA solutions, exchange video data
and analytics expertise across WOG and expand the video sensor network
and insights derived to aid in operational workflows</p>
<p>VAS is designed for the needs of government agencies - agencies can kickstart,
deploy and develop VA projects quickly and effortlessly. They can leverage
on their own videos as well as videos from other agencies, and make use
of existing VA algorithms from GovTech and across the Government on Commercial
Cloud (GCC) ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Why use VAS?</h3>
<p>Quickly generate insights and analysis from videos collected during trials,
proof of concepts, and pre-analysis work, speeding up VA tasks.</p>
<p>Reduce manual analysis and unlock critical time and cost savings.</p>
<p>Develop your own VA models for custom use cases and still maintain operational
flexibility vis-à-vis private commercial vendors.</p>
