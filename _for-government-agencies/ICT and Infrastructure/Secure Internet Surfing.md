<h3>Enabling public officers to browse safely on government work devices with Secure Internet Surfing (SIS)</h3>
<p>As part of the Digital Workplace (Link to DWP product page), SIS is a
remote browsing technology solution that allows the majority of public
servants here to access the Internet securely using their work laptops,
without the need for a separate device</p>
<p>Content is loaded into isolated containers and unsafe content will be
filtered out to prevent a data breach or malware infection</p>
<p>They will also be able to log in to social media sites to make text-based
posts, as well as open links directly from e-mails and documents.</p>
<p><strong>Include first infographic from Straits Times article (to recreate, different design)</strong>
</p>
<p>As an extension of SIS, there is also Content Disarm &amp; Reconstruction
(CDR) - a security feature that aims to reduce security risks when downloading
files from internet sites, by isolating potential malware threats and allowing
only clean and high-fidelity file content to reach the Government Standard
Image Build (GSIB) work devices for file download via SIS</p>
<h3>Why is SIS important?</h3>
<p>SIS helps to improve public officers' productivity while safeguarding
sensitive government data.</p>
<p>With CDR, the number of allowed websites and file types for downloads
will be increased - user experience will be improved while browsing the
Internet.</p>
