<h3>Enabling public officers to browse the web safely on work devices with Secure Internet Surfing (SIS)</h3>
<p>Circa 2016, in response to the rising surge of cyber threats, the government
introduced a security measure to have public officers delink their work
computers from the internet. When surfing the web for work purposes, they
had to do so on separately issued laptops, or on their personal devices.
This was a last-resort measure as there was no mature solution in the market
then that could ensure the security of government data.</p>
<p>This, however, impeded productivity. Shaking up the status quo, GovTech
created Secure Internet Surfing (SIS). This is a remote browsing technology
solution that loads content into isolated containers so that unsafe malware
can be blocked and filtered out.</p>
<p>Available as part of the <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/productivity-and-marketing/digital-workplace/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Digital Workplace</u></a>,
SIS now allows public offers to access the internet without the need for
a separate device. With it, they can enjoy peace of mind while performing
tasks such as logging into social media platforms to upload posts, as well
as opening links directly from emails and documents.</p>

</p>
<p>As an extension of SIS, there is also Content Disarm &amp; Reconstruction
(CDR), a security feature that aims to reduce security risks associated
with file downloading. CDR isolates potential malware threats and allows
only clean and high-fidelity file content to reach the Government Standard
Image Build (GSIB) devices for file download via SIS.</p>
<h3>Why is SIS important?</h3>
<p>SIS improves public officers' productivity while safeguarding sensitive
government data. With CDR, the number of allowed websites and file types
for downloads is also increased.</p>

<h3>How to use SIS?</h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Access the <a href="https://gccprod.sharepoint.com/sites/GOVTECH-digitalgov/digitalworkplaceproducts/SIS/SitePages/Home.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SIS site</a> on
the Government Intranet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if your agency or team has a Whole-of-Government Azure M365 AAD
group. If yes, reach out to the group owner, request to be added to that
group and raise a SIS SR to whitelist the site you want.</p>
</li>

<p>For the complete process of SIS Whitelisting, visit this <a href="https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-docs/tools/gitlab/sis-whitelisting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>guide on the Singapore Government Developer Portal.</u></a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the SIS request is completed, test the file upload capability. You
may need to use incognito mode, clear all cache and cookies, and then reopen
the browser. Look out for the Safe Surfing logo, which indicates that Safe
Surfing is active.</p>
