<h3>Enhancing competencies in safeguarding data within the government with Data Loss Prevention</h3>

<p>When transacting with the government's digital services, the public trusts
us with their personal information and expects that we will use their data
responsibly. Any unauthorised use or disclosure of data can cause them
damage. The public confidence that we work so hard to build will also be
eroded in a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention is better than cure, it is often said. That is why GovTech
has created Data Loss Prevention (DLP), a product that harnesses technical
and process controls to detect anomalous activities such as unexpected
downloads of massive data to personal devices. Such activities are indicators
of malicious intent.</p>
<p>Integrated with the <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/productivity-and-marketing/digital-workplace/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Digital Workplace</u></a>,
DLP has been introduced progressively since May 2022 to enhance the existing
data security measures in all government-issued laptops.</p>
<h3>When is DLP activated?</h3>

you perform any of the following activities:</p>
