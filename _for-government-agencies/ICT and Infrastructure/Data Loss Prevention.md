<p>As part of the <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/productivity-and-marketing/digital-workplace/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Workplace</a>,
DLP uses technical and process controls to detect anomalous activities,
such as unexpected downloads of large amounts of data to personal computers,
that are indicators of possible malicious activity or data incidents</p>
<p>The public trusts us to use their data in a responsible way. Unauthorised
use or disclosure of data can cause damage to individuals, organisations
and/or the State, which will ultimately erode public confidence and trust
in us.</p>
<p>DLP has been introduced progressively since May 2022 to enhance the existing
data security measures in all government laptops</p>
<p>DLP will be applied when performing any of the following activities:</p>

<h3>Why is Data Loss Prevention important?</h3>
<p>Government data is a valuable asset and must be protected as we share
and use data more widely in our daily work.</p>
<p>Unauthorised use or disclosure of data can cause damage to individuals,
organisations and/or the State, which will ultimately erode public confidence
and trust in us.</p>
<h3>How to use Data Loss Prevention?</h3>
<p>DLP is automatically available on your device as part of the Digital Workplace.</p>
<p>When necessary, DLP will prompt you, the user, to confirm that the data
was intended to be transferred before proceeding to do so, and in some
cases, stop the anomalous data transfer altogether to prevent the loss
of sensitive data from Government networks and user devices.</p>
