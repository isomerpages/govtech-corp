<p>When transacting with the government's digital services, the public trusts
us with their personal information and expects that we will use their data
responsibly. Any unauthorised use or disclosure of data can cause them
damage. The public confidence that we work so hard to build will also be
eroded in a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention is better than cure, it is often said. That is why GovTech
has created Data Loss Prevention (DLP), a product that harnesses technical
and process controls to detect anomalous activities such as unexpected
downloads of massive data to personal devices. Such activities are indicators
of malicious intent.</p>
<p>Integrated with the <a href="http://tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/productivity-and-marketing/digital-workplace" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Digital Workplace</u></a>,
DLP has been introduced progressively since May 2022 to enhance the existing
data security measures in all government-issued laptops.</p>
<h3>When is DLP activated?</h3>
<p>Data are a valuable asset and must be protected as we share and use them
more widely in our daily work. Hence, DLP is automatically activated when
you perform any of the following activities:</p>

<p>As part of the <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/productivity-and-marketing/digital-workplace/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Workplace</a>,
DLP uses technical and process controls to detect anomalous activities,
such as unexpected downloads of large amounts of data to personal computers,
that are indicators of possible malicious activity or data incidents</p>
<p>The public trusts us to use their data in a responsible way. Unauthorised
use or disclosure of data can cause damage to individuals, organisations
and/or the State, which will ultimately erode public confidence and trust
in us.</p>

<h3>Why is Data Loss Prevention important?</h3>
<p>Government data is a valuable asset and must be protected as we share
and use data more widely in our daily work.</p>
<p>Unauthorised use or disclosure of data can cause damage to individuals,
organisations and/or the State, which will ultimately erode public confidence
and trust in us.</p>
<h3>How to use Data Loss Prevention?</h3>
<p>DLP is automatically available on your device as part of the Digital Workplace.</p>
<p>When necessary, DLP will prompt you, the user, to confirm that the data
was intended to be transferred before proceeding to do so, and in some
cases, stop the anomalous data transfer altogether to prevent the loss
of sensitive data from Government networks and user devices.</p>
