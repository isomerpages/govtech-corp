<h3>About data loss prevention</h3>
<p>Data loss prevention refers to a set of technologies and processes designed
to detect and prevent sensitive data from leaving an organisation's control.
It encompasses measures to identify, monitor, and protect data in use,
in motion, and at rest.</p>
<p>The risks associated with data loss are significant in today's digital
landscape, including financial losses, reputational damage, and legal penalties.
Adding to these concerns, Singapore's recent data reflects the growing
urgency for robust protection: in Q4 of 2024 alone, the nation recorded
191,390 data breaches.&nbsp;As a vital aspect of <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/our-capabilities/cybersecurity/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>cybersecurity in Singapore</u></a>,
vulnerabilities in cloud computing security further complicate matters,
as sensitive data stored in cloud environments can be susceptible to unauthorised
access.</p>
<p>Recognising data as a critical asset for <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/our-enhanced-smart-nation-vision-paving-the-way-for-a-new-digital-era/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singapore's Smart Nation initiative</u></a>,
data loss prevention is paramount. To uphold a trusted digital ecosystem,
the government must implement robust measures safeguarding citizen and
business data. Effective data loss protection solutions are therefore essential
for maintaining public trust and ensuring the integrity of digital services.
As such, strong data loss prevention has become crucial for national security
and economic stability.</p>
<h3>GovTechâ€™s data loss prevention solution</h3>
<p>When transacting with the government's digital services, the public trusts
us with their personal information and expects that we will use their data
responsibly. Any unauthorised use or disclosure of data can cause them
damage. The public confidence that we work so hard to build will also be
eroded in a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention is better than cure, it is often said. That is why GovTech
has created Data Loss Prevention (DLP), a product that harnesses technical
and process controls to detect anomalous activities such as unexpected
downloads of massive data to personal devices. Such activities are indicators
of malicious intent.</p>
<p>Integrated with the <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/productivity-and-marketing/digital-workplace/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Digital Workplace</u></a>,
DLP has been introduced progressively since May 2022 to enhance the existing
data security measures in all government-issued laptops.</p>

more widely in our daily work. Hence, DLP is automatically activated when
you perform any of the following activities:</p>
