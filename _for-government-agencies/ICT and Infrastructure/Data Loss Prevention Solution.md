<h3>About data loss prevention</h3>
<p>Data loss prevention refers to a set of technologies and processes designed
to detect and prevent sensitive data from leaving an organisation's control.
It encompasses measures to identify, monitor, and protect data in use,
in motion, and at rest.</p>
<p>The risks associated with data loss are significant in today's digital
landscape, including financial losses, reputational damage, and legal penalties.
Adding to these concerns, Singapore's recent data reflects the growing
urgency for robust protection: in Q4 of 2024 alone, the nation recorded
191,390 data breaches.&nbsp;As a vital aspect of <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/our-capabilities/cybersecurity/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>cybersecurity in Singapore</u></a>,
vulnerabilities in cloud computing security further complicate matters,
as sensitive data stored in cloud environments can be susceptible to unauthorised
access.</p>
<p>Recognising data as a critical asset for <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/our-enhanced-smart-nation-vision-paving-the-way-for-a-new-digital-era/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singapore's Smart Nation initiative</u></a>,
data loss prevention is paramount. To uphold a trusted digital ecosystem,
the government must implement robust measures safeguarding citizen and
business data. Effective data loss protection solutions are therefore essential
for maintaining public trust and ensuring the integrity of digital services.
As such, strong data loss prevention has become crucial for national security
and economic stability.</p>
<h3>GovTech’s data loss prevention solution</h3>
<p>When transacting with the government's digital services, the public trusts
us with their personal information and expects that we will use their data
responsibly. Any unauthorised use or disclosure of data can cause them
damage. The public confidence that we work so hard to build will also be
eroded in a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention is better than cure, it is often said. That is why GovTech
has created Data Loss Prevention (DLP), a product that harnesses technical
and process controls to detect anomalous activities such as unexpected
downloads of massive data to personal devices. Such activities are indicators
of malicious intent.</p>
<p>Integrated with the <a href="/products-and-services/for-government-agencies/productivity-and-marketing/digital-workplace/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Digital Workplace</u></a>,
DLP has been introduced progressively since May 2022 to enhance the existing
data security measures in all government-issued laptops.</p>
<h4>Real-life sample / case studies</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>GovTech’s DLP solution encompasses three key areas: Email DLP, Endpoint
DLP, and Proxy DLP. These components work in tandem to provide comprehensive
data leakage protection.</p>
<p>In each scenario, DLP will inspect the documents or text being transmitted,
and will then determine if an alert or action is required, based on the
data classification and information security of the files or text you are
working on. This process helps mitigate potential risks to data leak protection
tools and strategies. To illustrate how DLP functions in practice, consider
the following common user interactions and system responses:</p>
<p><strong>Alert</strong>
</p>
<p>When the system identifies classified or sensitive information, like an
email containing a document marked "Restricted," an alert appears. This
notification serves as a prompt, informing the user of the potential risk
involved. The action proceeds without further intervention, allowing the
user to continue while remaining mindful of the data's sensitivity. It's
a subtle yet crucial reminder to exercise caution when handling protected
information.</p>
<p><strong>Affirm</strong>
</p>
<p>If the system detects potentially sensitive data, especially in situations
where classification is unclear, it will request user affirmation. For
instance, when uploading a file without a specified classification to the
government cloud website, a prompt will appear. Users must then confirm
their authorisation by clicking "Okay" or halt the transmission by clicking
"Cancel." This step ensures that sensitive data is shared exclusively with
authorised parties, maintaining stringent data access control.</p>
<p><strong>Block</strong>
</p>
<p>In cases where the system identifies classified or sensitive data that
violates established DLP rules, such as an email containing a "Secret"
attachment directed to external recipients, the action is automatically
blocked. A notification will then inform the user of the blocked action.
By clicking "Close," the user acknowledges the notification. This prevents
the unauthorised transmission of highly sensitive information, safeguarding
it from potential exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Other scenarios</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond these scenarios, Data Loss Prevention proactively monitors various
other data transfer activities to ensure ongoing security.</p>

<h4>How to use DLP?</h4>
<p>DLP comes pre-installed on all government-issued devices as part of the
Digital Workplace, ensuring seamless and immediate protection. When a potential
data transfer triggers DLP rules, a prompt will appear, requiring users
to confirm their intent. This prompt will clearly outline the detected
risk and provide options to either authorise or cancel the action. If a
data leak is detected, the system will automatically block the transfer
and generate an alert, notifying both the user and relevant security personnel.</p>
<p>For any queries or support, users can <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>contact us</u></a>.</p>

<p><strong>What types of data are protected using DLP?</strong>
</p>
<p>DLP protects a wide range of sensitive data, including personal identifiable
information (PII), financial data, intellectual property, and classified
government information. It uses content inspection and contextual analysis
to identify and protect sensitive data across various formats and locations.</p>
<p><strong>What data leakage protection tools are included in this DLP solution?</strong>
</p>
<p>This DLP solution incorporates a suite of data leak protection tools,
including Email DLP. Endpoint DLP, and Network DLP. These tools work in
concert to monitor and control data movement across devices, networks,
and cloud applications, providing comprehensive protection against data
leaks.</p>
<p><strong>What should I do if legitimate file transfers are being blocked?</strong>
</p>
<p>If legitimate file transfers are being blocked, users should first verify
the file's classification and ensure it complies with security policies.
If the transfer is still blocked, they should contact the GovTech service
desk, providing details of the file and the intended recipient, for further
assistance.</p>
